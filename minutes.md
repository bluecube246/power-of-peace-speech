# Meeting Minutes

## 10/4/2020 - Students Only

- Find patterns for unrelated text in each article providers by looking at common patterns in first few words of paragraph and header tags. (Matt to work more on this)
- Find patterns of noisy text by new source. Focus sources that contribute 25% of the data

## 10/6/2020 - Full Team

- We got the data - two types of files: 1) sources and 2) folders of by year/month containing the text
- "xx" country - possibly when no country in the sources.
- Pre-process in batches
- We are looking to understand the data we have -- descriptive analysis, we can do that in sections, not necessarily all at once. 
- Don't over-delete when removing sentences
- Sanity check that sentence removal is not overdoing it
- Mentors will bin countries into 3 groups and let us know
