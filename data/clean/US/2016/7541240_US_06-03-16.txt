Thanks for being a ' community of giving '  We would like to thank the following organizations for helping to start out 2016 as a " community of giving " -- of their time , talent and treasures .  Skagit Habitat for Humanity 's Habitat Helpers program helps low-income home owners make minor repairs to their homes . On Feb. 6 , Eric Torset and several volunteers from local Carpenters Union 70 " Carpenters in Training , " along with SHFH volunteers , helped build a wheelchair ramp for a disabled woman . She and her family are so thrilled that she now has a safe environment , has gained mobility and the ability to live independently .  On Feb. 20 , a group of 15 high school students , neighbors , SHFH volunteers and several Mount Vernon Police Department staff members worked to rebuild fencing in the 27th Street neighborhood . The fences will be painted by the Parks Department ; within a few weeks you will see artwork on these and other fences in the area .  Special thanks go out , officer Brien Reed for helping coordinate Mount Vernon High School students , David Hillman of Hillman Tranquil Hardscapes for being the project manager for the day , Sound Cedar for donating the fence boards and Home Depot for donating the concrete and nails .  Thanks also to Skagit Community Foundation , Thrivent Financial and US Bank for helping to fund the tools in our dedicated tool trailer as well as some of the projects .  I love being a part of a community where people get together to help make a difference . Neighborhood revitalization happens when civic and business groups partner with people to empower and enhance quality of life for neighborhoods.
