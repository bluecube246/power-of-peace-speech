<h> Dallas Cowboys Minicamp Updates From Day 1 Of Practice <p> We 'll keep a running tab on what is going on out at Valley Ranch today as the Dallas Cowboys participate in their minicamp . Today marks the first day of the mandatory practices and this time the press is allowed in . <p> So far we 've noted that both Rolando McClain and Ronald Leary will be present at the minicamp . But , given their absence at the OTAs , the Cowboys will be slowly working them into practice . <p> Rolando McClain , Ron Leary will not be full participants . Will do non-competitive drills and then work on conditioning <p> As for who played where , a few nuggets from Bryan Broaddus on Twitter . David Irving took over at LDE as the starter . Randy Gregory and Michael McAddoo worked the main reps on the right side . Backing up Irving on the left side were Charles Tapper and Ryan Russell . Jack Crawford also got a lot of work at defensive end but Broaddus did n't make clear exactly where and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jon Machota says that Russell was getting first-string reps on both sides .
