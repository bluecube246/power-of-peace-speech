Walker <h> HIGHLIGHTS <p> Acclaimed newsman retiring after 46 years with show <p> A background as war correspondent <p> One of the legends of television news -- also along with Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt the guiding force of " 60 Minutes " since joining 46 years ago -- steps down Sunday night . But how exactly is a network supposed to finally say goodbye to Morley Safer , 84 , who will be accorded an hourlong special at 8 p.m. on CBS/2 , " Morley Safer : A Reporter 's Life " ? <p> CBS has tried in recent days , but words have not come easily . Asked on " CBS This Morning " Friday what was " so unique about Morley , " " 60 Minutes " correspondent Steven Kroft offered just one : " Morley . " <p> In a phone interview earlier today , Jeff Fager , the executive producer of " 60 Minutes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early years , " Mike was the hard-hitting , tough interview , but Morley brought the piece that in some ways invented the whole genre -- the beautifully written story , with his own observations . Just about everything he did was an adventure in one way or another . " <p> Safer joined " 60 Minutes " in 1970 , after a long and journalistically brilliant slog through battlefields around the globe , many of them in Vietnam . Wanting to leave all that behind , he found another kind of battlefield on West 57th Street . The " creative tension " at " 60 " was prized , also ferocious , exemplified by the combative styles of Wallace ( who died in 2012 ) and Hewitt ( in 2009 ) . <p> A calm amid the raging storm , the distinct " Morley " style also found its way onto the screen , often in profiles ( Jackie Gleason ) , even occasionally in a few stories that brimmed with measured outrage ( Safer 's 1983 piece about the wrongly convicted Lenell Geter helped set him free a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sensibility was shaped by what Safer had seen of war , imbued by a keen appreciation of the great pleasures of life . A bon vivant , he loved art , food and wine . He and his longtime producer John Tiffin ( who died in 2010 ) also wandered the world . They boarded the Orient Express , visited a home for retired opera singers in Italy , found tango dancers in Finland . They helped -- mightily -- the U.S. wine industry with 1991 's " The French Paradox " ( wine can lessen the risk of heart disease , Safer almost gleefully reported ) . <p> Those pieces were whimsical . A 1978 story called " The Music of Auschwitz " was heartbreaking . <p> You always sensed that Safer had done it all , seen it all and somehow even felt it all . How does an hour special even begin to capture this legendary run ? <p> Sign up for Newsday 's Entertainment newsletter for the latest on celebs , TV and more .
