Scott: A career of building coalitions
http://timesargus.com/article/20160731/NEWS01/160739913

<p> Phil Scott likes to tell people how , about 20 years ago now , he did not have a political bone in his body . He grew up in Barre and spent his adult life building a family , a career as a contractor , and a reputation as a race car driver . He takes great pride in his blue-collar roots . <p> But when he started to see politics miring the Legislature , he decided to step up . <p> That trajectory ? serving in the Senate and then as lieutenant governor ? has forced him to become the leader he felt Vermont needed then ? and now . <p> On Aug. 9 , he appears on the Republican ballot with primary challenger Bruce Lisman to be the state ? s next governor . <p> ? I certainly have lived a different life than many , ? Scott , who turns 57 this week , said during an interview at The Times Argus offices last week . <p> He pointed to working 30-plus years as a small-business owner , spending many sleepless nights worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forced me to have a frugal , common-sense approach , ? Scott said . <p> The Republican , known for his moderate views that closely mirror the demeanor and policies of former governor James Douglas , has always served in the minority in Montpelier . <p> ? I have been slugging it out in the trenches . ? But I have known I wanted to be part of the solution , ? he said . Scott said he has done that by reaching out to Democrats , independents and progressives at the State House when it came to building coalitions . He said he has always made a point of listening to others , because ? no one person ever has all the ideas. ? <p> ? I ? ve been able to build consensus . I have the respect and trust of others . And I think you lead by example , ? he said , adding that he is glad he can say he is a safe-and-steady politician . ? I think people appreciate my independence , my follow-through . ? I am not one to over-promise. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult fiscal and infrastructure challenges ? <p> ? I want to provide for a much more affordable Vermont , ? he said . ? I believe a more vibrant economy will lift all boats ? taxes will go down . We will provide more resources for all of those who need services . ? ( Being governor ) has not always been an aspiration , but I believe it is a calling today. ? <p> Scott maintains the state is having an ? affordability crisis ? that is affecting many public policy sectors , as well as the economy . <p> ? Expectations are far outweighing our ability to pay , ? he explained . ? We are having a crisis of affordability right here in Vermont. ? <p> He said it would be imperative to look at the state ? s economy over the previous year and examine what has grown ; then , set a cap that corresponds to that growth before building the budget . From there , Scott said , he would go through a prioritization process that looked at both the budget , cuts and savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in their businesses They expect the state to do the same , ? he said . ? It ? s not easy . But we can live within our means , and send that message to Vermonters . ? It will go a long way toward our recovery. ? <p> Scott says he would form a committee to look at ways to modernize and make efficient the various departments of state government . ? We should always look for ways to save money . There are ample ways to look for savings. ? <p> Scott looks upon Gov . Peter Shumlin ? s administration as having taken too many risks at the expense of Vermonters , especially when it came to Vermont Health Connect . Critics of the Democratic governor characterized many of his initiatives as ? experiments. ? <p> Scott is less condemning in his rhetoric and criticism of Shumlin but does point to what he sees as an overarching problem that the next governor will certainly face . <p> ? We need to restore the faith and trust in government across the board , ? Scott said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insists that has to happen through coalition-building , partnerships , thinking outside the box , and taking measured , tactful steps forward . <p> ? Vermonters deserve that right now , ? he said . <p> ? We often get caught up sometimes in adding and plugging all of the holes . We need to be more efficient . ... I am confident there are ample opportunities to do things differently . It comes down to ways in which we are treating our businesses , entities and citizens fairly. ? <p> While Scott has not rolled out specific plans for improving the economy , changing the state ? s demographic ? especially bolstering the age group between 25 and 35 ? and for transportation and other sectors , his stances on many issues on Vermonters ? minds are clear . <p> First and foremost , Scott says , Vermont has to get its economy on track . He says that hinges on attracting and retaining families and businesses . <p> ? We need to be a magnet , ? he said , whether that is keeping students who attend colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks for businesses who want to be here . ? We provide many opportunities for people to come to us , ? he said . ? But we need to keep ( that core ) here , contributing , paying taxes. ? <p> He said an exodus of the workforce between the ages of 25 and 35 has really hurt the state . <p> In the end , he said , it requires a ? culture change. ? <p> ? It ? s become stagnant . ... If they are not in the system , not part of the community , the burden is on the rest of us still standing . We need a climate that is conducive to growth , and make Vermont affordable. ? <p> He has been quoted as saying Vermont needs to increase its population by about 70,000 to 700,000 . <p> ? We need to revitalize , become a magnet , ? he said . ? There are so many things we have to offer , but we have to market it in a different way. ? <p> After the economy , Scott said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic . <p> ? We have seen this rising addiction issue rising in other states , as well , ? he said , pointing to how the problem is not unique to Vermont . ? It has affected each and every one of us. ? <p> Scott said it has become far too easy to become addicted , in part because he said doctors are over-prescribing certain drugs . <p> The answer , he said , lies in a balance of prevention , treatment and enforcement . <p> In turn , Scott said Vermont needs to re-evaluate how it serves the mentally ill and the pressures that parity issues place on other health-related needs across the spectrum of treatment . <p> He said while Act 46 was not ? something I would have crafted , it has been a great way to start the conversation ? across Vermont when it comes to school consolidation . <p> ? I have been listening to Vermonters screaming for property tax relief for years , ? he said , adding that while he would not ? like his opponent , Bruce Lisman ? call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ? I would support school choice , ? he said , as well as making sure those communities that do want to consolidate are provided with proper incentives . ? We need more carrots than sticks , ? he said . In the end , however , Vermont is educating 20,000 fewer students than 10 years ago and spending $1.6 billion to do so . ? Inaction is not the answer . ? It is necessary to get a handle on the cost of education , ? Scott said . <p> While he is not a supporter of industrial wind , he is a proponent of solar and renewables . In particular , he said as governor he would open new partnerships with Canada to tap into hydro-electric resources there that would ? meet our needs just fine. ? <p> He is not in favor of a carbon tax . ? It raises the cost of living throughout . I am looking for make Vermont more affordable , ? he said . <p> And when it comes to health care reform , Scott has been critical of Vermont Health Connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw proof it worked , he would not get behind the governor ? s plan . Scott stood by that claim . <p> ? I would pull the plug on Vermont Health Connect , ? he said , adding that he would opt to switch to the federal exchange but carry over pieces and parts of the system that might be working . Scott said he would look to other states , like Hawaii , Maryland , Oregon and Connecticut , that have cobbled together a health care exchange for far less than what Vermont is spending . <p> He called Vermont Health Connect a ? failed , ill-conceived IT structure. ? <p> ? I think there are ways out there that can work for us , too , ? he said . <p> Does Vermont need more restrictions on gun purchases ? ? No , we just need to enforce the laws we have on the books . ? It ? s not a problem here in Vermont . In fact , it ? s a bit of a distraction. ? Scott said while terror threats are real , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We need to get to the root of the problem , ? which he described as the people who are misusing guns ? some of them mentally ill ? and getting them the help and services they need . <p> When asked what he thought of the tenor of the campaign so far , Scott , the presumptive front-runner according to polls , said he is ? not at all surprised . It is exactly how I envisioned it. ? <p> He said the primary challenge has made him a better candidate . <p> Of Lisman , he said , ? I am disappointed in my opponent , his tone . ( I feel he is ) misrepresenting the truth , and I don ? t have a lot of patience for that . It ? s concerning. ?
