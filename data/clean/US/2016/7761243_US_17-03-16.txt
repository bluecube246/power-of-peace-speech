washington -- " if his poll numbers hold , trump will be there six months from now when the sweet 16 is cut to the final four , and he will likely be in the finals . "  my prediction , in july of 2015 , looks pretty good right now .  herewith , a second prediction . republican wailing over his prospective nomination aside , donald trump could beat hillary clinton like a drum in november .  indeed , only the fear that trump can win explains the hysteria in this city . here is the washington post of march 18 : " as a moral question it is straightforward . the mission of any responsible republican should be to block a trump nomination and election . "  the orwellian headline over that editorial : " to defend our democracy , the gop must aim for a brokered convention . "  beautiful . defending democracy requires republicans to cancel the democratic decision of the largest voter turnout of any primaries in american history . and this is now a moral imperative lectures , the post celebrates democracy -- so long as the voters get it right .  whatever one may think of the donald , he has exposed not only how far out of touch our political elites are , but how insular is the audience that listens to our media elite .  understandably , trump 's rivals were hesitant to take him on , seeing the number he did on " little marco , " " low energy " jeb and " lyin ' ted . "  but the big media -- the post , wall street journal , new york times -- have been relentless and ruthless .  yet trump 's strength with voters seemed to grow , pari passu , with the savagery of their attacks . as for national review , the weekly standard and the accredited conservative columnists of the big op-ed pages , their hostility to trump seems to rise , commensurate with trump 's rising polls .  as the wizard of oz was exposed as a little man behind a curtain with a big megaphone , our media establishment is once was .  and the gop ?  those republicans who assert that a trump nomination would be a moral stain , a scarlet letter , the death of the party , they are most likely describing what a trump nomination would mean to their own ideologies and interests .  barry goldwater lost 44 states in 1964 , and the gop fell to less than a third of congress . " the republican party is dead , " wailed the rockefeller wing . actually , it was n't . only the rockefeller wing was dead .  after the great yellowstone fire in the summer of ' 88 , the spring of ' 89 produced astonishing green growth everywhere . the yellowstone fire of the gop was in ' 64 , burning up a million acres of dead wood , preparing the path for party renewal . renewal often follows rebellion .  republican strength today , on capitol hill and in state offices , is at levels unseen since calvin coolidge . turnout in the gop primaries has been running at levels unseen in american history , while in the obama-clinton race of 2008 .  this opportunity for republicans should be a cause for rejoicing , not all this weeping and gnashing of teeth . if the party in cleveland can bring together the trump , ted cruz , marco rubio and john kasich forces , the white house , supreme court and congress are all within reach .  consider . clinton was beaten by bernie sanders in michigan , and pressed in ohio and illinois , on her support for nafta and the trade deals of the clinton-bush-obama era that eviscerated american manufacturing and led to the loss of millions of factory jobs and the stagnation of wages .  sanders ' issues are trump 's issues .  a trump campaign across the industrial midwest , pennsylvania and new jersey featuring attacks on hillary clinton 's support for nafta , the wto , mfn for china -- and her backing of amnesty and citizenship for illegal immigrants , and for the iraq and libyan debacles -- is a winning hand .  lately , 116 architects and subcontractors of the bush i and ii foreign they will not vote for , nor serve in a trump administration .  talking heads are bobbing up on cable tv to declare that if trump is nominee , they will not vote for him and may vote for clinton .  this is not unwelcome news . let them go .  their departure testifies that trump is offering something new and different from the foreign policy failures this crowd did so much to produce .  the worst mistake trump could make would be to tailor his winning positions on trade , immigration and intervention -- to court such losers .  while trump should reach out to the defeated establishment of the party , he can not compromise the issues that brought him where he is , or embrace the failed policies that establishment produced . this would be throwing away his aces .  the trump campaign is not a hostile takeover of the republican party . it is a rebellion of shareholders who are voting to throw out the corporate officers and board of directors that ran the company into the ground .  only buchanan 's commentaries in your email  bonus : by signing up for pat buchanan 's weekly alerts , you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email .  name*  firstlast  email*  where we will email your daily updates  postal code*  a valid zip code or postal code is required  click the button below to sign up for pat buchanan 's commentaries by email , and keep up to date with special offers from wnd . you may change your email preferences at any time .
