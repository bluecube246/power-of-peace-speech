" A few people decide what 's in and what 's not , " he told Radio.com in 2014 . " And the masses just scratch their heads . You 've got Grandmaster Flash in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ? Run-D.M.C. in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ? You 're killing me . That does n't mean those are n't good artists . But they do n't play guitar . They sample and they talk . Not even sing . "
