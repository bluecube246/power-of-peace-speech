<p> The column that wonders how it can snow in the morning and be completely gone by noon . <p> -- <p> Good morning ! <p> -- <p> Jaime E. Marine South Jersey Times <p> " A note from Bingo Chair Madeline Wolk : " Well Soroptimist Bingo is over for 2016 . Congratulations to all our winners . Thank you to all our guests , to the members , the sponsors and everyone who donated . Thank you . Thank you And to my Bingo committee ladies and our soroptimisters this event went so well because of you . I thank you for all for a great job . " <p> - Peggy Gentile-Van Meter <p> -- <p> Code Blue could become a statewide program thanks to legislation that advanced through committee Thursday . <p> For those not in the know , and if you 're reading this column how do you know not , Code Blue is a program that sets up temporary warming shelters for homeless and vulnerable individuals when it gets too cold out . <p> It 's saved lives and helped bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trenton to talk about the importance of Code Blue . <p> He must have done a pretty good job . <p> -- <p> " I have a suggestion for an event . It is like Code Blue , call it Code Green . Spring is approaching and the inner city streets and alleys need quite a lot of work . The Mill-town area has years of trash dumped in alleys behind homes and lots of graffiti . Many have worked to help feed our neighbors . The city recently beautified and enhanced the City Park enjoyed by all . We spent millions on splash park , dam and walks from taxes generated mostly from homeowners and renters living with and in this mess . Can we as a community initiate a spring cleanup ? With Taxes of the highest in the country people should not have to live like this . I hope the whole community bane together for the greater good . " <p> - Fred Goldschmidt <p> -- <p> " Try to imagine what the Bridgeton city park looked like in 1786 . Can you visualize the oak forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes . The clear blue pollution free river . From 1786 on the landscape would be forever changed and the Cohansey River would never look the same again . <p> " Development would take over the area . State permission was granted to build a dam and raceway to provide waterpower to a gristmill . The meadow and marsh , where the tide ended , would be covered with water sometime before 1800 . The land would change hands after 1800 and a second raceway would be dug to supply waterpower to a nail mill near the commerce street bridge . <p> " The nail mill would begin operation in 1815 . It began as a modest six-building enterprise , but its effect on Bridgeton would last for almost 100 years . Skilled workmen from up and down the east coast would make Bridgeton their new home . Disaster struck in 1824 and all but one building was destroyed by fire . Newspapers from Boston to Charleston reported the catastrophe . Undaunted , the owners rebuilt and over the next 50 years the mill expanded to include over 40 structures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " In 1893 Mr. Buck saw fit to lease the 1,100 acres from the mill . His intention was to use the land for ' pleasure or for commercial purposes . ' It was n't until 1906 that a formal park was formed . However , citizens have been using the woods , raceway and lake for recreation for years . Usage most likely began in 1850 and by the 1880s boating , swimming and picnics were a common occurrence . <p> " There are many ' secrets ' about the park that are both comical and serous . What sparked the outrage over the nude bathing on the raceway ? Where was a the boardwalk ? What was the Cumberland County Club ? Where was the original city dump ? These and many other facts will be discussed . <p> " If you would like a preview some of the other areas in the park to be discussed check out the display case in the library lobby . On March 10 , 2015 , at 7 p.m. there will be exhibits , photographs and maps to help understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with others . Hope to see you there .
