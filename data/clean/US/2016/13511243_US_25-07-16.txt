dnc convention warren : trump fans ' flames of fear and hatred '  philadelphia ( ap ) -- liberal stalwart elizabeth warren is using her democratic convention speech to make clear her view that americans wo n't fall for donald trump 's plan to fan what she calls " the flames of fear and hatred . "  the massachusetts democrat says in excerpts of a speech she plans to deliver later tonight that the republican presidential nominee is peddling an old story of " divide and conquer . "  warren says trump thinks he can win votes " by turning neighbor against neighbor " and by persuading voters that the source of their problems is " people who do n't look like you , or do n't talk like or do n't worship like you . "  she says bankers , oil companies and giant corporations benefit " when we turn on each other . "  warren says a divided america ca n't " fight back against a rigged system . " she says " the american people are not falling for calling for the democratic party to unite around hillary clinton -- and the democratic senator from new jersey says clinton would be a champion for the poor as president .
