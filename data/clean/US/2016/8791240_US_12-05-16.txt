<h> The UK economy is slowing -- and it 's not just because of the ' Brexit ' vote <p> What is likely to happen in the event of a " Brexit " ? Bank of England governor , Mark Carney debates the scenarios and talks about the central bank 's position on giving forecasts versus risks . <p> The Bank of England cut its growth outlook for the U.K. from 2016 through to 2018 on Thursday , as it announced no change to its main interest rate and stock of purchased assets . <p> Members of the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted unanimously to keep the main rate at the record-low of 0.5 percent and maintain the bank 's stock of purchased assets at ? 375 billion ( $543.4 billion ) . The follows the MPC 's meeting this week and came as no surprise after seven years of holding rates . <p> " In the United Kingdom , activity slowed in the first quarter and a further deceleration is expected in the second quarter . There are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee 's latest projections , activity growth recovers later in the year , but to rates that are a little below their historical average , " the bank 's summary of the MPC meeting said . <p> Bloomberg <p> Guests wearing pro-Brexit t-shirts arrive for the premiere of " Brexit : The Movie " in London . <p> U.K. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth is now seen averaging 2.0 percent in 2016 , down from the 2.2 percent forecast by the bank in February . Growth is seen at 2.3 percent in both 2017 and 2018 , down from the 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent annual rates forecast in February . <p> The bank said U.K. economic activity growth would pick up by mid-2017 in the event of a " remain " vote , but would be weaker than forecast in February . It attributed this to disappointing productivity growth , fiscal consolidation and relatively high debt-to-income ratios that suggested households would be less likely to cut back on saving and spend more than assumed previously . <p> " The biggest risk to the forecast remains the referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a media conference on Thursday . <p> " If there were a vote to leave ... we would expect a material slowdown in growth and a notable rise inflation -- a challenging trade-off , " he later said . <h> Recession risk <p> Carney added that in a downside a scenario , a " Brexit " could result in a technical recession -- a risk several economists have touted in recent weeks . <p> U.K. GDP growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year , down from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 . The bank sees growth slowing further between April and June this year , to 0.3 percent . <p> The U.K. Treasury estimated in April that Britain would be worse off by ? 4,300 per household per year after 15 years outside the European Union ( EU ) . <p> Carney said a Brexit would likely result in a higher risk premium on sterling assets and a decline in foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . <p> " It would appear that some of the considerations behind FDI is the U.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at the conference . <h> Sterling fall partly due to referendum <p> Sterling has declined by around 9 percent since in a peak in November 2015 . The bank said in its inflation report on Thursday that roughly half of that decline reflected the perceived risks of the Brexit vote . <p> Carney said the currency could suffer a further sharp fall if the country quit the EU . <p> In its report , the bank addedthat the cost of insuring against a depreciation in sterling , versus an appreciation , had increased substantially , suggesting market participants saw a further steep decline in the U.K. pound as relatively likely following the referendum . <p> The impact on other U.K. assets , such as equities , was harder to quantify , the central bank said . <p> Carney added that it was a fair assumption that international financial markets would suffer negative spillovers from a Brexit . He said this was the no. 1 issue raised when he met with fellow central bank governors , foreign ministers and heads of major international corporations , banks and asset management firms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to negative spillovers : BoE Carney <p> CNBC 's Geoff Cutmore asks Bank of England governor , Mark Carney about the global repercussions that could take effect , in the event that the U.K. chooses to leave the European Union . <h> Further easing ? <p> The fallout from a Brexit vote could be such that the bank introduces new monetary easing measures . These could include quantitative easing , credit easing or additional liquidity facilities for banks , Carney said on Thursday . <p> He added that the Brexit referendum posed a more serious economic risk than 2014 's Scottish independence vote . <p> " The issues around Scotland principally affected financial stability in the short-term ... these were issues that we took seriously ... but they were not issues that at the time , in the judgement of the MPC , rose to the level of being the biggest risk to the economic outlook to the U.K. , " Carney said . <p> He denied the bank was breaching its political independence by setting out the risks of leaving the EU . <p> " We are providing information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives a sense of the major risk , " Carney said . <h> Rates seen lower for longer <p> The Bank of England held its forecast for consumer inflation at 0.4 percent for the second quarter of 2016 -- far below the targeted 2.0 percent . <p> " This shortfall is due predominately to unusually large drags from energy and food prices , which are expected to fade over the next year , " the bank said in its summary of the MPC meeting . <p> It cut its forecast for the second quarter of 2017 to 1.5 percent from 1.6 percent and held its estimate for second quarter 2018 at 2.1 percent . Inflation is seen at 2.2 percent in the second quarter of 2019 . <p> The bank now sees its base rate remaining at 0.5 percent until the second quarter of 2017 at the earliest , having previously forecast the rate would reach 0.6 percent by then . It also cut its predicted rate for the second quarter of 2018 to 0.6 percent from 0.9 percent . <p> External forecasters are more bullish , forecasting the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 and 1.3 percent by the same period in 2018 , according to the Bank of England .
