only three of the top 50 free agents remain unsigned  posted by zac jackson on march 27 , 2016 , 5:45 pm edt  getty images  just about all the big-ticket shopping is done .  with nfl teams turning their full attention to the draft , the first phase of free agency is all but over . following some notable transactions last week , just three players on the pft hot 100 free agent list remain unsigned : no. 25 ryan fitzpatrick , no. 33 reggie nelson and no. 45 nick fairley , who 's reportedly getting close to a deal with the saints .  only a couple major pro day workouts remain on the calendar , so teams are turning their attention toward private workouts and the final round of pre-draft meetings . there still could be a signing or two pop up on the transaction wire , but sometimes players still available after the first wave of movement choose to wait , thinking they 'll have more leverage or more options following the draft .  this year 's draft is in a bit of a staredown , with the broncos looming as a possible contender . nelson will have multiple options , too , though one of them probably disappeared last week when the titans signed former cardinals safety rashad johnson . it 's not just the first wave that went fast ; with the cowboys having signed running back alfred morris last week , players 51-66 on the hot 100 list all have new contracts .  how was ronnie hillman not in the top 50 ? i did n't look at the list before i wrote this comment but i 'm sure he 's better than some of the players that were at the bottom-end of the top 50 . for example , nick fairley . are you kidding me ? hillman 100% has more value than him , imo . yes , hillman is a change of pace back , but he can provide homerun-type plays and carry the load for a few games if the starter goes down .  intrafinesse says:mar 27 , 2016 5:55 pm  kind of sad when a back up level qb .  if you watch the jets games last year , he got huge help from brandon marshall . fitzpatrick could lob it up and marshall hauled it in . if fitzpatrick had just an average wr , his stats would have been much worse .  " how was ronnie hillman not in the top 50 ? i did n't look at the list before i wrote this comment but i 'm sure he 's better than some of the players that were at the bottom-end of the top 50 . for example , nick fairley . are you kidding me ? hillman 100% has more value than him , imo . yes , hillman is a change of pace back , but he can provide homerun-type plays and carry the load for a few games if the starter goes down . "  reggie nelson is free one year post-aftermath of the aaron hernandez trial -- which brought up nelson 's involvement in a college shooting of two men -- allegedly . he is on the wrong side of 30 , but has been playing well . has his n't sign him , but it looks like it may cost him in the end .  the year before on the texans fitz had 17 tds and 8 picks before getting hurt . 12 games . so over 16 that would be a pretty good season . 25 tds and 12 picks maybe . how did brandon marshall help him that year ? plus , decker had 12 tds , and those were n't lobs either . most were post patterns in the middle of the end zone . tight throws necessary . you can find a lot of receivers that are considered top guys that had less than 12 tds , and decker was the second target for fitz .  nelson would be a good fit in pittsburgh on a one or two year deal . of course the fact that they are division rivals make the extremely unlikely to happen but it would be a great fit for the player and the team  fits played good last year , minus the last game . they should give him a fair one year contract for $10-$12 mil  tedmurph says:mar 27 , 2016 6:58 pm  fitzpatrick had a career year last year . 3900 yrds , 31 tds , 19 ints , 88 rating . he 's absolutely a starting level qb . not a superstar , but a middle of the pack guy . with bowles and their personnel on d , they have a shot to make some noise this yr . shoulda made the playoffs last yr . if they go from fitz to gsmith , imo , they go from having a shot to no shot .  on another note , the jags did a nice job in free agency . giants spent a lot of money . meh . i think the raiders did a nice job too . watch out for the jags and the raiders this year , as sleeper teams .  fitzpatrick should curb the ego and be thankful to be in the nfl . he 's a journeyman veteran qb that happened to have a big year . whoopedy doo . jets should give him a one year deal to prove he can do it again intrafinesse says : mar 27 , 2016 5:55 pm kind of sad when a back up level qb ( ryan fitzpatrick ) is a top 50 free agent .  if you watch the jets games last year , he got huge help from brandon marshall . fitzpatrick could lob it up and marshall hauled it in . if fitzpatrick had just an average wr , his stats would have been much worse .  ryan fitzpatrick may be better than geno smith , but he 's not a starting quality qb .  -- -  unfortunately , in today 's nfl , fitz is actually a starting qb . can you honestly name 32 qbs better than him ? and that just goes to show you why qbs like osweiler are getting paid . because there just are n't enough even average qbs out there to field one for each nfl team . and today 's nfl is a qb driven nfl , so even backup quality qbs are in the top 25 . because fitz may not be that good , but he 's a better option than voted to oblivion , and that 's understandable . he was not a top 50 fa . but the fact that people are upvoting that he sucks , just shows that not many of you watched the broncos this year . hillman is definitely not a true #1 , but he is a decent change of pace back .  stoneydog1000 says:mar 27 , 2016 8:35 pm  why is " nhpats " so infatuated with the bengals and andy dalton ? do the patriots bore you ?  cont ... on hillman . chris ivory was n't much better than hillman , and he was the afc 's leading rusher . give hillman the same amount of carries and his numbers would 've been almost identical to ivory , except hillman would 've had more touchdowns . look it up , dude definitely did n't suck  its not as hard as you think to be a top 50 fa . first of all , you need to be a fa .... most players that easily would be near the top of that list , teams refuse to let them between 10 and 50 and its pretty good size gap .  then when you play premium spot like qb it drives up your value , just like playing kicker or punter , hurts it . fitz is holding the cards , he knows he could be the starter in ny or denver , so why not put the pressure on him , he knows this is probably his last contract so he is trying to maximize it , especially when he is looking around at players like cousins and oswieler getting big money yes those players have upside , but a starter in the nfl now after the rookie contract gets 15 mil .  fitzpatrick .... ugh ..... if the jets had n't gotten petty for discount store prices , they would put more stock in him and he would be much further along . he needs to be somewhere he can develop behind one of the stud qb 's .  i am surprised denver has n't made a run @ fitz , they do n't have much more time with their present team  boltergeist19 says:mar 27 two ways after the draft . fits will sign with an incentive laden contract for 1 maybe 2 years or just in case there is trade talk with wilkerson and movement with some other teams backups like glennon , or mcclown , or hoyer or if they draft another project behind geno and bryce and convince everyone the team is going into camp with a qb battle and the best one will be there qb . which means they will have screwed up team chemistry and brandon marshall will flip out and use the retire card and it will be a mess with 3 guys who do n't know where any stand during the qb round robin season of qbs . it will turn out like houston 's problems with qbs last year . they all will start games and be up and down 1 good game 1 bad then they go to the next guy 1 good 1 bad then they finally give up at 3-6 and explain they are going with the rookie ( insert here ) for the rest of the year which means a lost season and mgmt when they can push the patriots for the division . never get teams that do this .  nelson will get a call when someone and it always happens where a knee gets hacked or someone tweaks an achilles ' tendon . but it wo n't be more then league minimum with incentives . i am thinking most gms think his year last year was due to a good supporting cast and wo n't repeat his performance coupled with age to be cautious here .  and hardy will get picked up by a team on another 1 year deal , by seattle , buffalo if they can find $ , or back with dallas . if it 's dallas , garret will tell the media he is impressed with how he has come in humbled and a great teammate and is working very hard to put the past behind him and of course " prove all the doubters wrong . " with his play . another words " total spin , " from the comment he made a few weeks back , " greg hardy is a free agent a 33 year old qb 11 seasons and 6 different teams to have his best season .  ryan , cutler and stafford all had a better qb rating and completion % . 2 of the 3 threw for more yards ... all 3 are younger and already signed . none of the 3 are a career journeyman . ask tampa how they fell about throwing money at josh mccown .  you can debate if matt ryan , jay cutler and matt stafford are " franchise " qbs but there is no debate about ryan fitzpatrick .  i am not too surprised nelson is n't signed , he is going to be 33 yrs old by the 3 or 4th game of the season , while he did have a great season , the 07 class is winding down .. you have players like megatron , lynch , patrick willis retired .  ap , joe thomas , and greg olsen are all getting up there in age , he may be like a james jones where if someone gets hurt you may bring him in , but other  i think we should all take a moment to thank the houston texans and the philadelphia eagles for the fact that we now live in a world where ryan fitzpatrick thinks he 's worth $18m a year .  if a completely unproven backup who got benched for a 40 year old who could n't throw the ball 15 yards down the field and a rag armed china doll who ca n't stay on the field and has never won anything can get that much , why should n't he ?  ca n't really blame him . he has , in fact , shown better results over a larger sample size than both of those guys put together .
