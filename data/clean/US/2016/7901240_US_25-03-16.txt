" there 's zero humor or self-deprecation , as there was in joss whedon 's pitch-perfect ' the avengers ' ; no performance of unlikely depth , like the one heath ledger pulled off in ' the dark knight ' ; and no animating spirit of decency , a trait christopher reeve 's superman had in spades , " time out new york writes .  and indiewire points out a major disappointment of our batman v superman : dawn of justice ' to justify its title , and another 30 to establish it 's a red herring . "  the hollywood reporter questions any collaboration between the two comic-book characters going forward : " it 's hard to say what ought to happen between batman and superman in the future , even , indeed , if they actually should share the screen again . "  this version of superman is n't likable .  warner bros .  page 2 of 3 - henry cavill as superman .  this is henry cavill 's second time playing the character , following 2013 's " man of steel , " and many critics have been turned off by a kal-el who seems more jaded than how we 've seen the character portrayed in the past .  " i would have given anything to watch clark kent open up his shirt , to reveal that big ' s , ' then go off to save the day as the music swells . but this superman is n't that superman , " uproxx writes . stuck with a character who spends far too much time reacting to others , whether it 's to batman 's taunts or the romantic overtures of lois lane ( amy adams ) . "  director zack snyder is more interested in blowing things up than telling a story .  warner bros .  snyder , right , with ben affleck .  the direction by snyder , responsible for previous comic book adaptations like " 300 " and " the watchmen , " is getting a lot of the blowback . many critics felt he was too focused on the visuals in " batman v superman . "  " although director zack snyder is a great visualist , all he has here is pretty pictures and giant ( and confusing ) action sequences , " nj.com said .  " snyder is not without skills , or ideas , " the chicago tribune writes , " but when a critic finds himself at odds with almost every aspect of a director 's visual approach to material like this , material like this becomes pretty joyless . "  .  warner bros .  though critics universally praise the performance by gal gadot as wonder woman and many believe affleck does a good job as batman , something about the film 's length and lack of a coherent plot led to the vicious reviews .  page 3 of 3 - " there 's a lot that 's dumb in ' batman v superman : dawn of justice , ' but the dumbest thing is right there in the title , " the guardian wrote . " i could n't really figure out why these two guys were fighting . the film spends time setting up superman as an unwanted alien ... but i feel that if anyone is going to understand the nuances of being a superhero , it would be bruce wayne . "  " the film is too long by half and yet it never finds time to do any character work , focusing instead on relentlessly moving forward its over-complicated , unmotivated plot , " birth movies death said .  and the new york times believes " batman v superman " sums up that produce movies like this one , and the ambitious hacks who sign up to make them , have no evident motive beyond their own aggrandizement . entertainment is less the goal than the byproduct , and as the commercial reach of superpower franchises grows , their creative exhaustion becomes ever more apparent .
