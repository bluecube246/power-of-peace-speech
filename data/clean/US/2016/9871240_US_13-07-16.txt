Small Groups of Satellites Are More Accurate Because of Teamwork ...

<p> Different points of view are valuable when discussing any event or describing an object . Sure , you might have your own analysis , but somebody else is going to have seen something different . By combining all angles , a clearer picture emerges . <p> The same concept can be seen in a recent MIT study that found a cluster of three to eight small , " shoebox-sized satellites " are more accurate than a traditional , large satellite . Since the smaller satellites have multiple angles , their measurements were around twice as accurate . <p> In a paper set to be published in Acta **31;1398;TOOLONG issue , researchers simulated how accurate a single orbiting satellite with nine sensors can measure albedo , or the amount of light reflected from Earth , versus a cluster . Those measurements were compared with the statistics gathered by NASA Goddard 's Cloud Absorption Radiometer , which can obtain data from thousands of different angles on a single spot . The more satellites were in the cluster , the more accurate the measurements . <p> Advertisement <p> It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth is a three-dimensional object and has multiple angles of its own . In order to measure anything , you 'd need more than just a front-facing image . <p> " The Earth does not reflect equally in all directions , " said research leader Sreeja Nag . " If you do n't get these multiple angles , you might under- or overestimate how much it 's reflecting , if you have to extrapolate from just one direction . " <p> Sponsored <p> This is also useful if a researcher has to deal with a faulty satellite . If one of the pieces in a cluster fails , there will be others to provide backup . If you lose one solo satellite , you run the risk of losing all information . It 's the same in any team : if someone calls out sick , you 'll have someone to take over any workload . <p> More importantly , researchers emphasize that providing more accurate measurements of Earth will help in the fight against climate change . By providing better estimates , scientists can calculate long-term trends and projections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the biggest uncertainties in climate change , because it is a complex function of where on Earth you are , what season it is , what time of day it is , and it 's very difficult to ascertain how much heat leaves the Earth ... If we can estimate the reflectance of different surface types , globally , frequently , and more accurately , which a cluster of satellites would let you do , then at least you 've solved one part of the climate puzzle . " <p> To replace every satellite with a cluster would be too expensive , but Nag suggests at least using them in cases where satellites need to hold a strict formation . Researchers added that they hope they can see something like this in play soon . <p> " Our team fully expects that a demonstration mission of this type could be flown within the next decade , " said Oli de Weck , a professor with MIT 's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics .
