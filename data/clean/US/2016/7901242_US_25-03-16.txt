larry sanders , garry shandling , and the refuge of comedy  comedy is a refuge for unhappy people . at its best , the genre lets you cover up with a blanket in the dark and be around people who are not going to yell at you or call you a loser or rub your failure in your eyes . here are people who want to make you laugh . and there 's security in that . it 's calming . being alive means being around people who are meaner than hell , and comedy can have the nobility to say " all right , let 's make somebody 's day better for half an hour . "  that 's the real appeal , beyond the superficial entertainment value , of something like cheers , or sanford and son . these shows do n't try to teach you , they 're just taking you someplace nicer than you were before . and they can do it in an aspirational way . where science fiction or pure fantasy asks you to live in an alternate universe it can say , " here are real people , and they do n't have to be mean to you . this is a version of people that 's better than the one you knew . "  i was 14 when i started watching the larry sanders show -- created by and starring the great garry shandling , who passed suddenly on thursday at the age of 66 -- during its first syndication run outside pay cable . i was a miserable kid , constantly fighting off widescreen grayscale loneliness and alienation , and i was desperate for what i realize now was just normal human interaction and emotion . on paper , i should have hated the show , because it looks and smells like a meta-comedy about a rich guy in los angeles with a pretty successful network talk show . just utter l.a. inside baseball , nothing but ventura boulevard and canyons and the 405 at rush hour ; entourage before entourage . i should have hated it . it checked every box on my list of tv writing pet peeves .  but i did n't up taping the entire run , in order , on a vcr , because dvd recorders -- the dvr was still many years away -- were still too expensive . somewhere in the purgatory of my father 's shed , i still have a carefully labeled box containing all episodes of the show on tdk cassettes .  i watched it over and over . i memorized not just the words but the beat and melody of the words . i know the damn blocking on some of my favorite scenes . it changed my whole concept of what comedy was allowed to do , and what writers were allowed to do , and i probably would n't be working without it .  hbo  the reason is this : the larry sanders show certainly looked like a behind-the-scenes comedy about comedy , a self-reflexive intellectual exercise that only clicks with people who know what it 's like to fly from los angeles to new york and understand why tv tapings are ultimately sad . but it 's not . that 's just the frame . that was the easiest sitcom about real human emotion , the real inner workings of people . it had an emotional intelligence i had no idea could exist in comedy .  before larry sanders , as much as i liked sitcoms , i thought every player in the idiom was a stock character , a variant of a type , and had one of about five possible punch lines to a given setup . but here was something where a setup would take place , and the characters would respond like real people .  extreme example : hank kingsley ( jeffrey tambor ) , larry 's often-buffoonish sidekick , is meeting the wu-tang clan . in any sitcom before larry sanders , the only punch line to that setup , which is , essentially , " the world 's most uncool uncle meets the world 's coolest musicians , " is " hey , you fellas are rap singers , so i thought i could sing you a rap ! "  but larry sanders never fell on stock jokes . so hank tries to ingratiate himself to them like a real person honest-to-god uncool uncle . the result is a lethal jumble of racism and bewildered hideous ignorance . he calls ol ' dirty bastard " dirty old bitch " and claims he hates cops entirely on the basis of his parking tickets . the scene is so uncomfortable you 'll want to scream , and you 'll want to scream because it feels like it 's really happening . there is no artifice . this is a real mistake a real person could make .  moments like that gave the show a sense of danger . without the artifice of sitcoms that came before , without stock players , stock gags , there were no safety nets . any bad thing was capable of happening . characters could break down , try to kill themselves , fail in a way that was n't reversible by next week 's episode . and it was unafraid to go to these places . as funny as larry sanders could be , what made it one of the greatest achievements ever in television was how much real pathos it found . it could be downright resonate . funny moments weigh more when they are surrounded by the real human condition , which is one of constantly staving off sadness and hiding vulnerability and dread . lots of shows would go on to do that , most notably the office , alongside the overwhelming majority of tone-blending " prestige " comedies -- from louie to transparent ( which , perhaps not coincidentally , co-stars tambor ) to togetherness -- now on the air . but none of them would exist without larry sanders .  the triumph of shandling 's career is that he did n't need to do this show . he had enormous skill as a stand-up . he was a successful sitcom writer . he could have made a great conventional sitcom -- though , years before sanders , he created and starred in the groundbreaking , convention-subverting it 's garry shandling 's show -- and he was a regular guest host on johnny carson 's tonight show , where he was even offered the opportunity to make that a permanent fill-in gig . ( it goes without saying he would have been better . ) but he did n't take any of these paths before him . he made something with soul instead .  and this is not the sentimental overrating of a recently deceased performer 's work . garry shandling is on record about his ambitions for the show . in judd apatow 's interview collection sick in the head , he spells it out :  " when we were doing larry sanders , it was all about life and the question of self and what you were bringing to it . ... and what people are always covering up -- the tension between what they 're covering emotionally in life and what 's really going on inside them . what you really want to write is what they 're covering ; otherwise you end up writing the exposition -- which is just words . "  a couple moments jumped out at me when i got the call yesterday and learned garry shandling had died . they were both from the larry sanders finale , and they both underline its emotional depth . the first is when larry has ended still there , the lights are still on him , he 's on a stool . his producer , artie ( rip torn ) , comes over to him and says it was a great show . they embrace . then larry chokes out the words " i ca n't get off the stool . i ca n't move my legs . " it 's a pitch-perfect depiction of a panic attack , and that just was n't done in comedy at that time , and if it was , it was melodramatic . this was real .  the other moment comes just a bit later . the studio is empty . everyone is gone . larry 's walking around absently , missing what is now his old life . artie is sitting in the back drinking booze out of a coffee cup . and they talk about their plans and their regrets , quietly internalizing the fact that the active part of their adulthood is over . they 're old men now . then hank shows up . and this is the perfect example of what shandling was talking at .  hank is superficially furious that his segment got cut . he seems prepared to kill somebody . and he delivers a fire-and-brimstone monologue most people ca n't walk back .  " what is my problem ? i spent the last 10 years being the butt of your jokes . the little fucking dog at the end of the couch ! and you know , it 's my fault , because i smiled and i let it happen because this face was being seen by millions of people every night and there was lots of money and there was lots of pussy ! "  larry tries to defuse with a joke .  " more money than pussy . "  hank lunges at him , and this is not a comedy about comedy anymore . this is greek tragedy .  " no more ! " roars hank . " i swear to god , no more , one more remark and i , i , i swear , i 'll fucking choke you with my hands ! "  he tries to walk off , he leaves , backs his car into a dumpster , and comes back in tears . they all reconcile and agree to go to the smoke house for drinks . hank and artie leave , but larry stays behind a second , surveying the darkened stage , aware that his set will be torn down by morning and thrown into the garbage . any other show would have tried to arrange a more cinematic happy ending . but this is an honest happy ending . none of these men is happy , but they 've found acceptance , and that 's a more honest victory .
