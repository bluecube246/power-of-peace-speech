john mccain says isis fight reminds him of vietnam  john mccain says isis fight reminds him of vietnam  washington -- sen. john mccain warned tuesday that the obama administration 's " grudging incrementalism " in the fight against isis risks a failure akin to the vietnam war .  " as a young military officer , i bore witness to the failed policy of gradual escalation that ultimately led to our nation 's defeat in the vietnam war , " mccain , chairman of the senate armed services committee , wrote in a letter sent to defense secretary ash carter .  the naval pilot-turned-politician survived over five years as a prisoner of war in vietnam .  mccain said that he fears the nation 's current strategy of " grudging incrementalism in the war against the islamic state risks another slow , grinding failure for our nation . "  in the letter , the arizona republican asserted that conversations he has had with military commanders confirm for him that the military 's actions have shifted from " considering what it will take to do by the administration . "  in response to a request for comment , pentagon spokesman matthew allen told cnn , " the department has received senator mccain 's letter and will respond directly as appropriate . "  mccain concluded his letter with several questions seeking more information on the current and future fight against isis , also known as isil , in iraq , syria and libya .  as the senate armed services committee weighs the defense department 's 2017 budget request , mccain said he and his committee " must have full insight into the scale and scope of u.s. military operations against isil.
