John McCain says ISIS fight reminds him of Vietnam  John McCain says ISIS fight reminds him of Vietnam  WASHINGTON -- Sen. John McCain warned Tuesday that the Obama administration 's " grudging incrementalism " in the fight against ISIS risks a failure akin to the Vietnam War .  " As a young military officer , I bore witness to the failed policy of gradual escalation that ultimately led to our nation 's defeat in the Vietnam War , " McCain , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , wrote in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Ash Carter .  The Naval pilot-turned-politician survived over five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .  McCain said that he fears the nation 's current strategy of " grudging incrementalism in the war against the Islamic State risks another slow , grinding failure for our nation . "  In the letter , the Arizona Republican asserted that conversations he has had with military commanders confirm for him that the military 's actions have shifted from " considering what it will take to do by the administration . "  In response to a request for comment , Pentagon spokesman Matthew Allen told CNN , " The Department has received Senator McCain 's letter and will respond directly as appropriate . "  McCain concluded his letter with several questions seeking more information on the current and future fight against ISIS , also known as ISIL , in Iraq , Syria and Libya .  As the Senate Armed Services Committee weighs the Defense Department 's 2017 budget request , McCain said he and his committee " must have full insight into the scale and scope of U.S. military operations against ISIL.
