<p> COLUMBUS , Ohio -- This is n't another story about an opposing team changing its defense to combat Ohio State 's offense . <p> But it kind of is . <p> That 's been a nice talking point over the last two-plus Buckeyes seasons . Since Virginia Tech brought a bear into Ohio Stadium and won in 2014 , everyone has been on the lookout for wholesale defensive changes done by opponents meant to throw off Urban Meyer 's explosive offense . <p> That game was a frustrating experience for Meyer , but not a new one . Oklahoma did it to him first . <p> " That 's one of the first times that -- that 's one of those sick feelings on the sidelines , " Meyer said , recalling coaching against the Sooners in the 2009 BCS National Championship while at Florida . <p> " You use language I ca n't use right here , like son of a -- it 's tough . " <p> As Meyer told it , in the 40 days the Gators had to prepare for Oklahoma , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma came onto the field that night in South Florida , it was 3-4 . <p> Minor change to the naked eye . It completely changes the way you call a game offensively . <p> An Oklahoma defense that was No. 68 in total defense and No. 58 in scoring that year held Florida -- the No. 4 scoring offense in college football -- to 24 points . Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin were grounded a little bit , or at least kept out of the end zone , and that gave the Sooners a better chance . <p> Florida won , 24-14 , to give Meyer his second national championship . <p> So here 's the minor cautionary tale from Meyer 's BCS memories of Oklahoma for Ohio State as the Buckeyes get ready to head to Norman , Okla. , this weekend : Prepare for everything , and anything . <p> " I just remember the conversations , ' What if they change ? ' Meyer said . <p> The Buckeyes know that , because since that loss to Virginia Tech other teams have tried to mimic the Hokies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a difference if your players are n't good . <p> Oklahoma has good players . The Sooners now play a base 3-4 defense -- maybe they liked what they saw in that BCS title game -- and it seems unlikely that they would flip back to a 4-3 . You stick with what works . <p> But Oklahoma has played two games , and it will show something different defensively -- even if it 's minor -- to Ohio State on Saturday . <p> " You see something on film and most of the time it 's consistent with what you see , but there 's going to be a new wrinkle , " quarterback J.T. Barrett said . " You try to judge other teams on film based on our formations , different plays and formations , but understand that they might approach you in a totally different way . "
