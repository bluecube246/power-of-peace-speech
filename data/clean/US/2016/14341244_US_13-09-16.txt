COLUMBUS , Ohio -- This is n't another story about an opposing team changing its defense to combat Ohio State 's offense .  But it kind of is .  That 's been a nice talking point over the last two-plus Buckeyes seasons . Since Virginia Tech brought a bear into Ohio Stadium and won in 2014 , everyone has been on the lookout for wholesale defensive changes done by opponents meant to throw off Urban Meyer 's explosive offense .  That game was a frustrating experience for Meyer , but not a new one . Oklahoma did it to him first .  " That 's one of the first times that -- that 's one of those sick feelings on the sidelines , " Meyer said , recalling coaching against the Sooners in the 2009 BCS National Championship while at Florida .  " You use language I ca n't use right here , like son of a -- it 's tough . "  As Meyer told it , in the 40 days the Gators had to prepare for Oklahoma , most Oklahoma came onto the field that night in South Florida , it was 3-4 .  Minor change to the naked eye . It completely changes the way you call a game offensively .  An Oklahoma defense that was No. 68 in total defense and No. 58 in scoring that year held Florida -- the No. 4 scoring offense in college football -- to 24 points . Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin were grounded a little bit , or at least kept out of the end zone , and that gave the Sooners a better chance .  Florida won , 24-14 , to give Meyer his second national championship .  So here 's the minor cautionary tale from Meyer 's BCS memories of Oklahoma for Ohio State as the Buckeyes get ready to head to Norman , Okla. , this weekend : Prepare for everything , and anything .  " I just remember the conversations , ' What if they change ? ' Meyer said .  The Buckeyes know that , because since that loss to Virginia Tech other teams have tried to mimic the Hokies much of a difference if your players are n't good .  Oklahoma has good players . The Sooners now play a base 3-4 defense -- maybe they liked what they saw in that BCS title game -- and it seems unlikely that they would flip back to a 4-3 . You stick with what works .  But Oklahoma has played two games , and it will show something different defensively -- even if it 's minor -- to Ohio State on Saturday .  " You see something on film and most of the time it 's consistent with what you see , but there 's going to be a new wrinkle , " quarterback J.T. Barrett said . " You try to judge other teams on film based on our formations , different plays and formations , but understand that they might approach you in a totally different way . "
