Steve Van Kuiken is the pastor . Traditionally at the end of the Easter service , the congregation releases helium-filled balloons that float to the ceiling of the Gothic-style sanctuary , and slowly descend to the floor during the following week . <p> It 's not the way most congregations celebrate Easter , but Lake Street is n't like most churches , and Van Kuiken is n't like most Christian ministers . <p> When he was the pastor of Mount Auburn Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the local Presbyterian governing body defrocked him because he had performed marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples . <p> The Presbytery of Cincinnati , a group of 86 local churches that included Mount Auburn , voted to remove Van Kuiken as pastor of the church . Almost a year later , a higher Presbyterian church court , the Permanent Judicial Commission of the Synod of the Covenant , reversed that decision and reinstated him as a minister . <p> The vindication came a little late for Van Kuiken , who had already accepted a separation agreement from Mount Auburn , which he said included about a year 's worth of pay . <p> At that time , the Presbyterian Church USA permitted " holy union " ceremonies between same-sex couples , but nothing , such as an exchange of rings , that might cause people to confuse them with a real marriage ceremony . In those holy union ceremonies , ministers were not allowed to imply that they were blessing sexual intimacy , either . <p> " It 's a travesty , " Van Kuiken told the Cincinnati Post at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the case ? " <p> After he left Mount Auburn , Van Kuiken served as pastor for a small group of former Mount Auburn members that called themselves The Gathering . They met initially at one another 's houses , then at the former St. George Catholic Church building in Clifton , then in an Over-the-Rhine storefront . <p> The congregation could only pay him for part-time work , so he took a job working in a halfway house in Over-the-Rhine for former federal prisoners . After about seven years of doing both jobs , he said , it began to wear on him , and he started looking for a full-time pastoral job . <p> Meanwhile , The Gathering continued to grow , and in 2007 became part of the United Church of Christ . Last May , the congregation merged with Northern Hills Unitarian Church at 460 Fleming Road , and the two congregations became The Gathering at Northern Hills . <p> Van Kuiken loved living and working in Tucson , he said , but it was a bit far from his grown daughters in Cincinnati and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also live nearby . <p> Three years ago , he took the job in Evanston because it was closer to home , he said , but also because the congregation felt like a better fit for his beliefs . It 's officially part of the American Baptist Churches USA , which he said is the most liberal Baptist denomination , he said , but " it 's way to the left " of any other American Baptist church . <p> Visitors would recognize Sunday worship as being rooted in the Christian tradition , he said , with readings from the Bible , organ music and some familiar hymns . But they would also hear some Buddhist or Hindu readings , he said , because many of the church 's 200 or so members also identify with other religious traditions . <p> The congregation also believes strongly in working for social justice , he said , and the church has been " welcoming and affirming " toward gay and lesbian members since 1993 . <p> Since the PCUSA defrocked Van Kuken , much has changed in that denomination and in attitudes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 , the PCUSA agreed to change its definition of marriage from a covenant between a man and woman to one between two people . In June , in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges , the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states . <p> It surprised Van Kuiken how quickly things changed , he said , and he thinks that what he did helped move the needle a bit in the Presbyterian Church . He 's proud to have played a small role in changing society 's attitudes , and the rapidity of the change gives him hope for other social justice struggles . <p> " One thing I 've learned is that it 's not hopeless . It can change , " he said . " All these causes we 're working for now , whether it 's racial justice , or universal health care , any kind of thing , we 're working for victories that we ca n't even imagine will happen . It 's a very hopeful thing . " <p> Copyright 2016 Scripps Media , Inc . All rights reserved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or redistributed.
