<h> Gray strikes out 11 in 6 innings in 2-1 loss to Padres <p> SAN DIEGO ( AP ) -- Jon Gray pitched well enough to win Monday night , undone only by some well-placed hits by the San Diego Padres . <p> Gray struck out 11 , walked only one and allowed two runs and four hits in six innings of the Colorado Rockies ' 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres . <p> " The way it felt tonight to go through hitters and innings that quick , it 's something I have n't done in a while , so it really did feel good , " Gray said . " I think I can work off that next outing . " <p> Matt Kemp hit a two-run double in the first inning to help James Shields earn his first victory of the season . <p> Shields ( 1-4 ) allowed one run while scattering nine hits over six innings . He struck out five and walked two . The Padres took a quick lead against Gray after their first four batters reached . Jon Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's something I 've dealt with a lot lately , " Gray said . " I was just looking forward to the next guy . That 's the only thing I can do is get the next couple guys out . I felt pretty good from there . " <p> Gray ( 0-1 ) said his direction was a little off in the first inning . " I was pulling pitches across the zone , it 's something ( catcher Nick ) Hundley noticed right away and he was making gestures toward me to stay back and go straight to him and we made that adjustment pretty quick . " <p> Kemp 's two-run double was enough for Shields , who has gotten lousy run support this year . He had received just five runs of support in his previous five starts . The right-hander was coming off a hard-luck defeat at San Francisco on Tuesday , when he allowed three hits in a 1-0 loss to Johnny Cueto . <p> Shields gave up a two-out RBI double to Nick Hundley in the fourth , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <p> The Rockies had other scoring chances against Shields but failed to capitalize . DJ LeMahieu reached third with two outs in the third before rookie Trevor Story grounded out . LeMahieu was thrown out trying to steal third to end the fifth . Gerardo Parra reached third with two outs in the sixth before Ben Paulsen flied out . <p> Fernando Rodney pitched a perfect ninth for his fifth save . <p> Gray 's 11 strikeouts came a day after Clayton Kershaw struck out 14 and threw a three-hitter in a 1-0 victory against the Padres at Dodger Stadium . <p> " Jonny was outstanding , " manager Walt Weiss said . " Even the runs they got in the first inning were just well-placed hits . I thought he threw the ball extremely well . It 's unfortunate we could n't get him a win . He does n't have his first win yet , but if he pitches like that he 's going to get a lot of wins . " <p> TRAINER 'S ROOM <p> Padres LHP Robbie Erlin , on the disabled list since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow . <p> UP NEXT <p> Rockies : RHP Eddie Butler ( 0-0 , 3.86 ERA ) is scheduled to make his first start of the season , and second appearance , after being recalled from Triple-A . <p> Padres : RHP Andrew Cashner ( 1-2 , 4.94 ) starts Tuesday night . He 'll look to bounce back from his outing at San Francisco on Wednesday , when he lasted only 2 2/3 innings .
