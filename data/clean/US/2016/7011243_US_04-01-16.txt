Recent article comments  N. Powder rancher disturbed by occupation of wildlife refuge  By Jayson Jacoby/Baker City Herald January 04 , 2016 09:49 am  Curtis Martin , past president of the Oregon Cattlemen 's Association , worries the action will deflect attention from what he calls the " travesty of justice " involving the prison sentences of ranchers Dwight Hammond and his son , Steven  The situation in Harney County , with armed militia members occupying a federal building and vowing to stay there for years , is precisely the outcome Curtis Martin hoped would not happen .  Martin is a North Powder cattle rancher and past president of the Oregon Cattlemen 's Association .  He describes the five-year prison terms imposed on Harney County ranchers Dwight Hammond and his son , Steven , for lighting fires that burned onto public land , as a " travesty of justice . "  Yet Martin also is disturbed that a group of people , following a rally Saturday in Burns in support of the Hammonds , occupied the headquarters of the Malheur National Bundy and that group making it more volatile is an extremely sensitive situation , " Martin said Sunday afternoon .  " These outside influences are not necessarily of benefit to the Hammond family or to the ranching community . "  The Bundy who Martin mentioned is Ammon Bundy . He 's a son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy , who was at the center of a 2014 standoff with federal agents regarding grazing fees that Cliven Bundy had refused to pay .  Ammon Bundy , who is one of the leaders of the group that entered the Malheur refuge headquarters on Saturday , has called for people to join them in the occupation .  Martin worries that Bundy 's actions will deflect the public 's attention from the Hammonds ' story .  The father and son were convicted in 2012 of lighting fires on federal land adjacent to their cattle ranch southeast of Burns , near the wildlife refuge .  Although the Hammonds were charged under a federal terrorism law that mandates a five-year prison sentence , U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan in 2012 argued on " cruel and unusual punishments . "  Hogan sentenced Dwight Hammond to three months , and Steven Hammond to one year .  Martin said Hogan 's sentence was reasonable .  " He was a very conscientious judge , " Martin said of Hogan .  But a U.S. attorney objected to Hogan 's sentencing , and an appeals court ordered that the Hammonds be resentenced .  In October 2015 , U.S. Chief District Judge Ann Aiken sentenced both Hammonds to five years , minus the time both men had already served .  The Hammonds said they intend to turn themselves in to authorities today to begin their sentences .  Martin said he and other officials from the Oregon Cattlemen 's Association have been advocating on the Hammonds ' behalf in two ways .  First , Martin said , they are encouraging BLM officials to renew the Hammonds ' grazing permits for public land , without which the family would struggle to operate their ranch .  Second , Martin said he and others have tried to warn federal officials that the resentencing of 're seeing unfold now . "  " I have deep concern for the possible violence coming out of that , " Martin said . It is really a sad state of affairs that this kind of extremism on both sides has been so divisive . There 's no good that can come of it . We want to avoid news highlight reels of confrontations between armed citizens and Federal Marshals , but yet have this be the catalyst to work toward solutions for this injustice to never occur again between private citizens and government agencies .
