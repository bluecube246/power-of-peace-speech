Share this :  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers received a lot of criticism for selecting Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston with the No. 1 pick in the 2015 NFL Draft . After one season , it appears they made a smart decision .  Winston won the 2016 Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year award Saturday , beating out other top candidates such as St. Louis Rams running back Todd Gurley and Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper .  Winston started all 16 games for the Buccaneers this season . He threw for a rookie-leading 4,042 yards with 22 touchdown passes and 15 interceptions .  Tampa Bay finished 6-10 , good for last place in the NFC South . That said , the Bucs did improve by four wins from 2014 and their offense , led by Winston , running back Doug Martin and rising star wide receiver Mike Evans , is on track to be one of the league 's best in a few years .  The 2015 awards will be presented during NFL Honors , which airs Saturday on CBS at 9 @ @ @ @
