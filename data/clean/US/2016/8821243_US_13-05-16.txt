" He needs to live the rest of his life behind bars . " <p> Prosecutor Anne Mahoney told the judge that she made the plea offer of 32 years in prison in exchange for a guilty plea to murder because of the uncertainty of a trial .

" I want to say I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> The judge called Baez 's crime " monstrous , wicked and depraved , " and said he was struck by Baez 's decision to steal from Nieves after he killed her . <p> " Mr. Baez , you took a person who was a hard worker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had the love of family and friends , " Taylor said . " This is just a horrific act and it 's deprived a family of a loved one and society of a person who appeared to be nothing but absolutely good . "
