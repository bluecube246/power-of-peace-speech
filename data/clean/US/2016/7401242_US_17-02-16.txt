Thousands of sharks swarming off Florida shore  Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 blacktip sharks are currently swimming off the Florida coast , but while these numbers may seem menacing , shark researchers say it 's not unusual to see these animals -- visible as tiny dark spots in aerial photos and video -- in the area at this time of year .  These annual visitors are there to feed on fish and bask in warm coastal waters , according to Stephen Kajiura , a professor of biological sciences at Florida Atlantic University who conducts a survey of the migrating sharks every winter . And do n't panic -- these sharks typically have little interest in people , Kajiura told Live Science .  Kajiura began surveying the blacktip sharks in 2011 , counting them after they migrate to south Florida during the winter . He said these numbers are typical during the peak of the blacktips ' winter sojurn in the area , which begins in mid-January and lasts until the end of March .  The sharks , which grow to about 6.5 feet ( near Georgia and the Carolinas , where they mate and birth their pups , Kajiura said .  During their Florida stay , these colonies of blacktip sharks , so-named for the distinctive black markings on the tips of their dorsal fins and tails , gather in coastal waters stretching from Miami to Jupiter Inlet , covering a distance of about 80 miles ( 129 kilometers ) .  And the 10,000 to 12,000 estimate represents only the sharks that are visible in the narrow band of water about 660 feet ( 200 meters ) from the shore , Kajiura said , and is " a gross underestimate " of how many sharks there are in total .  To conduct the surveys , Kajiura mounts a high-definition video camera and a digital still camera to point out the window of a small plane as it flies adjacent to the beach . He later downloads the stills and footage to count all the visible sharks in the water .  " We see lots more sharks on the other side of the plane , so there 's a lot more out , " Kajiura told Live Science . " We simply do n't know how big this school is , how far it extends off into deeper water , " he said .  But people have little to fear from these seasonal visitors , Kajiura added . They feed on small , shiny fish , so swimmers should avoid wearing reflective watches or jewelry that might be mistaken for the sharks ' prey . And when the water is murky or when it 's dark out , a shark may be more likely to confuse light signals from human movement with prey activity .  Otherwise , " they 're not curious types , " Kajiura said , and as long as people exercise common sense and do n't harass the sharks , the blacktips will likely just avoid them completely .  And lucky beachgoers might even catch a glimpse of the colony without ever entering the water .  " You can literally sit on the beach and you can watch the blacktips jumping and spinning and splashing back into the water , " Kajiura said . " They part of their diet , so you may as well go to the beach and enjoy the phenomenon . "
