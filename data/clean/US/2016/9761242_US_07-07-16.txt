Everyone , relax . I know things have been tense , but I assure you that everything is now under control . I say this because I can now report with confidence that we have successfully determined the year and model of the Volkswagen Beetle sitting on the ocean floor in Pixar 's latest movie , Finding Dory . We 're going to be okay .  Does this count as a SPOILER ALERT ? Maybe , if knowing the year of a CG background prop will kill your enjoyment of a talking fish movie . So , you 're warned .  I took my son to see the fish-based movie ( he 's fond of all sorts of fish-related entertainment ; an all-cod production of Man of La Mancha delighted him ) and noticed a prominent cameo of an old Beetle patiently soaking on the ocean floor .

I could n't let them down with envy at those preening bastards who can identify the year of any classic ...

The rear shot gave me a lot of crucial data , but I was n't able to confirm until I saw the front . After processing both images through my dedicated VW Identificatron 2100 ( made from an Odyssey 2 connected to a bunch of flea collars wired in parallel , for image processing ) , I had my answer :  It 's a 1962 Beetle , a 1200 Standard ( non-export ) model .  Now , I need to explain why I think it 's a 1962 instead of a 1963 . The rear shot clearly established it as a ' 62 or ' 63 -- it has the three-chamber all-red taillights and the smaller , inverted cup-like license plate light . That combination only existed in 1962 or 1963 .  In the front , the visual difference is the presence . While that crest is absent here , I noted that the chrome strip on the hood seems a bit too short to reach all the way to the hood handle , suggesting a gap that once could have housed the small crest . That 's why I think this one is a ' 62 , just missing its crest after all those years in the deep . Some crab is probably wearing it like a pendant .

So , I suspect this bit of ocean floor is well outside US territorial waters .  As far as how it ended up there , I have no idea . But , since Beetles have been known to float , at least for a bit , the range of where an ocean-going Beetle may be is probably a bit larger than for most other cars .
