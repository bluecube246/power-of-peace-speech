What does an influx of low-skilled immigrants mean for the economy ?  Only at an economics conference will people talk for two hours about immigration and never mention Donald Trump .  What they discussed instead Sunday afternoon , on the opening day of the American Economics Association 's annual January gathering , were the forces that appear to be propelling Trump 's run for the Republican presidential nomination : increased immigration , liberalized global trade and the recent struggles of lower-skill American workers .  Several papers scheduled to be presented at the conference this week deal with the effects of immigration on native-born workers , for good and for bad . One of the first , co-authored by researchers from the Atlanta and Boston branches of the Federal Reserve , Federico Mandelman and Andrei Zlate , built a theoretical economic model to examine what happens to particular groups of native-born Americans when policymakers open up trade and allow more low-skilled immigrants into the country .  The short version of their results is that when trade increases , there are more jobs for highly fewer jobs for the workers in the middle , on assembly lines or in secretarial pools .  When low-skilled immigration increases at the same time , they find , wages stagnate for the lowest-skilled workers , even though there are more jobs for them to do , because there are more workers in the economy .  Those findings could be straight out of a Trump rally , if Trump rallies were held in carpeted hotel meeting rooms and the candidate mostly read equations to the crowd from a PowerPoint .  They track with the economic anxieties of workers without college degrees , who form the backbone of Trump 's support and who have seen millions of jobs outsourced in recent decades , while real wages stagnated for middle- and low-paid workers .  But the final result from the model probably wo n't ring true to those workers , at all .  It says they 're better off from those changes .  An influx of low-skilled immigrants should encourage low-skilled , native-born Americans to invest in more education and skills training , Mandelman and Zlate find those native-born workers buy , in the same way that increased trade lowers the cost of some consumer goods . Those things should be good for productivity , which is good for the economy .  The math in the modeling gets complicated here , but the end result , the researchers find , is that even lower-skilled native-born workers are better off with more trade and immigration .  Many workers quite clearly do n't see it that way , especially the ones at Trump rallies . Another economist who critiqued the paper , Brad Hershbein of the Upjohn Institute , noted several questions raised by the modeling results . For example , he asked if there 's really evidence of displaced workers increasingly investing in education and training -- and why America 's productivity growth has been sluggish in recent years , if immigration and trade are so good for productivity .  " Distributional effects and speed of adjustment matter , " he said , which is an economist 's way of saying , what if people in the real world are n't adjusting like your model predicts for politicians too .
