<h> How many of your passwords made the 2015 ' Worst Passwords ' list ? <p> SplashData has released the 2015 edition of its annual " Worst Passwords List " and , no surprise , ' 123456 ' and ' password ' once again reign supreme . <p> That pair have led the list every year since it was started in 2011 . <p> Many people thought longer was better and went with ' 1234567890 ' . <p> ' 1qaz2wsx ' ( first two columns of main keys on a standard keyboard ) , and ' qwertyuiop ' ( top row of keys on a standard keyboard ) also appear in the top 25 list for the first time , but they are each based on simple patterns that would be easily guessable by hackers . <p> " We have seen an effort by many people to be more secure by adding characters to passwords , but if these longer passwords are based on simple patterns they will put you in just as much risk of having your identity stolen by hackers , " said Morgan Slain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included ' passw0rd ' , ' welcome ' , and ' login ' . <p> Sports remain a popular password theme . While baseball may be America 's pastime , ' football ' has overtaken it as a popular password . Both appear in the Top 10 , with ' football ' climbing three spots to number seven and ' baseball ' dropping two spots to number 10 . <p> When it comes to movies and pop culture , The Force may be able to protect the Jedi , but it wo n't secure users who choose popular Star Wars terms such as ' starwars ' , ' solo ' , and ' princess ' , as their passwords . All three terms are also new entries on this year 's list .
