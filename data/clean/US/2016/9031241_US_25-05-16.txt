as a wife and mother to two young children living in the iowa country side , she tells kwwl she feels violated by the crude messages she has received day and night over the last 48 hours .  not wanting to be identified for the safety of her family , this iowa mother 's nightmare started two days ago with this 2 a.m. text asking " for a quickie in a discrete location . "  " okay he must of just dialed the wrong number , ha ha funny . then i got four or five more of them , " said the mother .  desperate to make them stop , she googled her number and found a prostitution website .  " this ad is using my phone number , " said the mother .  using it to solicit business " for a late night treat , " with " diamond rose . "  " every stay-at-home mom with two young children 's nightmare . they are not something you want to wake up and read . not even like one to the twenty random phone calls , " said the mother .  she has sent a request to have the ads taken down , but has received no answer .  contacting cedar rapids police where " diamond rose " appears to be located , she was told to change her number .  " so i am suppose to inconvenience myself , so that someone can run an illegal prostitution ring ? so that somebody can go out and sell themselves ? so they can get their drugs and they can run their prostitution ring and use my number to do so ? the problem with it is , that it is n't just going to happen to me . it is going to happen to somebody else and the next person and the next person , " said the mother .  kwwl spoke to cedar rapids police as well . they would not say whether telling a victim to change their number was standard procedure , if they get a lot of victims like this or if they were investigating this website .  the mother will the number she has had for nearly 10 years , but she says she would like to see the website taken down by authorities .
