News Release  U.S. Forest Service and Coca-Cola Announce the Restoration of One Billion Liters of Water  WASHINGTON , Sept. 13 , 2016 -- Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Coca-Cola North America President Sandy Douglas today announced that their partnership to restore and protect damaged watersheds on national forests achieved a milestone of one billion liters of water restored , and that the partnership will commit to double that outcome through 2018 . The 13 restoration areas are located on national forest land , which provides drinking water to more than 60 million Americans , and they ensure future generations will have access to fresh water .  " This milestone that Coca-Cola , USDA and our partners have reached is just the latest example of how partnerships between the public and private sectors can reach more people , harness more innovation , and do more good than either government or businesses can achieve alone , " said Vilsack . " America 's 193 million acres of public forests and grasslands supply the drinking water for 60 million Americans , support approximately 200,000 full and part each year . This partnership is based on shared goals of ensuring healthy watersheds and public engagement that serves those local communities , and will continue to deliver on that commitment for years to come . "  " A thriving watershed is critical to every community we serve and to our business , " said Douglas . " Coca-Cola is on a journey and plans to continue to replenish 100 percent of the water we use in our beverages and their production and return it to nature and communities . We could not accomplish the milestone we celebrate today without the expertise , guidance and resources of the USDA , the U.S. Forest Service , the National Forest Foundation and many other organizations and community partners . In the coming years , we will continue to work together to build scale and expand these projects and partnerships . "  This public-private partnership includes community organizations and taps their collective expertise to address increasing stress on water resources during challenging budget times . Dozens of local communities and hundreds of volunteers and youth worked together on water resource management education northern New Mexico is an example of the public-private partnerships approach . Local partners worked together to help restore an alpine meadow and enhanced a natural wetland habitat . By slowing the flow of Placer Creek , a tributary of the Rio Grande , the local team helped to restore a biodiverse meadow habitat and replenish the groundwater that contributes to the City of Santa Fe , New Mexico 's water supply . The meadow restoration project is expected to replenish approximately 49 million liters of water per year .  To date , Coca-Cola has contributed more than $2 million to the National Forest Foundation ( NFF ) , a Congressionally chartered foundation , to support USDA Forest Service water restoration projects . NFF has also contributed funding , expertise and overall project management , including the meadow restoration on the Carson National Forest .  " One of the primary purposes of the 1897 Act that established our National Forests , was to ensure the long-term supply of water for our country " Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell said . " More than 100 years later , the stewardship to be essential in ensuring an adequate water supply and providing high-quality water for needs across the United States . "  Project listing by National Forest ( some forests have multiple projects on site )  Angeles National Forest , California : The Angeles National Forest provides critical resources for the approximately 13 million people who live within an hour 's drive of the forest . In 2009 , the Station Fire damaged 252 square miles of forest , which allowed numerous invasive weed species to colonize upland in riparian ecosystems affected by the fire . In response to the fire 's devastation and associated ecological changes , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Forest Service staff partnered with the National Forest Foundation ( NFF ) and local communities to develop a 5-year restoration plan for Big Tujunga Canyon , ultimately expanding this work to the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument .  Carson National Forest , New Mexico : Historic and current recreational mining were threatening wetlands , a rare and critical resource in arid New Mexico . In addition , eroding gullies were adding sediment to area waterways with the National Forest Foundation , Coca-Cola , others to design a restoration strategy to prevent further loss of wetland , while also improving water quality in Placer Creek and Comanche Creek . The partnership also focused on enhancing important habitat for native flora and fauna .  Eldorado National Forest , California : The Mokelumne River supplies drinking water to 1.3 million people in the East San Francisco Bay and is vulnerable to upstream environmental damage . Ecological restoration projects like the one completed by the Indian Valley partnership improve the function of forest and wetland ecosystems , providing for the species that rely on them . More resilient ecosystems benefit downstream communities -- like those in the East San Francisco Bay -- by helping provide a consistent and clean supply of water .  Huron-Manistee National Forests , Michigan : Since 2008 , the Huron-Manistee National Forests and the Oceana County Road Commission have been working to replace deficient road stream crossings in the White River watershed , including along Osborne and Brayton Creeks . Undersized road-stream crossings prevent aquatic organism passage and contribute to frequent flood events that Replacing culverts with bridges helped resolve both environmental impacts .  Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie , Illinois : The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie was established in 1996 on the U.S. Army 's former Joliet Arsenal . Portions of the prairie -- including the South Prairie Creek Outwash Plain -- were heavily degraded by previous management actions . Partners focused their efforts on this particular portion of the landscape , replanting native grasses , treating invasive weeds , and removing agricultural drain tile . This prairie restoration improves the capacity to retain water , contributes to the formation of wetlands , and connects this area to Prairie Creek .  Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest , Washington : The Methow River basin provides spawning areas for Spring Chinook salmon , as well as spawning steelhead , cutthroat trout , and bull trout . By reestablishing active beaver colonies to area streams , the partnership helped reestablish key watershed processes that support these fish species . Beaver colonies reintegrate dams into the area surface water , establishing wetlands , expanding habitat , and increasing the regularity of flows . In addition , as the U.S. a better understanding of the ecological effects of climate change , this project demonstrates an adaptive practice that offsets snowpack loss by storing water in beaver wetlands .  Pike-San Isabel National Forests , Colorado : Burning nearly 140,000 acres , the 2002 Hayman Fire has had significant impacts on the municipal drinking water source area for the city of Denver , CO . The Pike-San Isabel National Forest worked with the National Forest Foundation , Coca-Cola , and other partners to address post-fire restoration needs through NFF 's Treasured Landscapes campaign , a multimillion dollar public-private partnership .
