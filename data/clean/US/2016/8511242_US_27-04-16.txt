Dowdle said they split up in Texas and eventually he returned to Arizona and surrendered to authorities to face the robbery charges . He said sometime in August 1991 , he saw McShane was in jail near him and they began to talk about what McShane did after they split .  " He told me he went to the east coast area , " Dowdle said .  He said McShane told him he went to " Atlanta City , " and he ( Dowdle ) thought he was talking about Georgia .  " He ( McShane ) said he was really bored even though there were boardwalks and gambling , " Dowdle testified . " He went to going on . A boy went into the woods . I do n't know whether he lured him or the boy ran into the woods himself . "  Dowdle said McShane told him he tried to molest the boy , but " the kid started screaming and Joe got scared it would draw the attention of adults nearby so he ended up killing the kid . "  The witness said after McShane told him the story , the next day in fact , he contacted his attorney , and told him what McShane told him .

"  Dowdle denied he met with Scottsdale police Detective Thomas Van Meter in January and May 1991 or telling Van Meter in May 1991 that McShane was in Arizona at that time . Van Meter was investigating the video store robbery at the time and looking for McShane .  Dowdle testified Wednesday morning he met with Van Meter in September 1991 to tell him that McShane may have killed a young boy in New Jersey .  McShane is expected to be called by the prosecutors as one of their rebuttal witnesses next week .  Lodzinski reported her son missing from the carnival at Kennedy Park in Sayreville , about 100 miles north of Atlantic City , the evening of May 25 , 1991 . She told police she turned around to pay for her soda at a concession stand and he was gone .
