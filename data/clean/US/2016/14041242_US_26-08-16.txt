<h> State suspends medical license of former South Bend abortion doctor <p> INDIANAPOLIS - The Indiana Medical Licensing Board early today took the medical license of a former South Bend abortion doctor for failing to exercise reasonable care and violating several notice and documentation requirements . <p> But it was a story that Klopfer told himself that struck a nerve with members of the board . <p> He spoke of a 10-year-old girl raped by her uncle who he performed an abortion on in an Illinois hospital but did n't notify police about the child abuse . Instead , he let her go home with her parents , who knew of the rape and refused to prosecute . <p> It was n't part of the complaint filed by the Indiana Attorney General 's Office but appeared to shift the case , with several members of the board bringing it up during final discussion . <p> Board member Rebecca Moredock-Mueller described Klopfer as having a nonchalant attitude and lacked sound medical judgment . <p> " The thing that bothered me most was his professional incompetence , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prolific abortion doctor in history with numbers going into the tens of thousands of procedures in multiple counties over several decades . <p> Testimony during Thursday 's hearing - which ended this morning - showed a man who was essentially using the same abortion and sedation procedures from the 1970s and 1980s . <p> Klopfer told the panel he has never lost a patient in 43 years of doing abortions and has never even had a patient go into cardiac arrest . <p> " Women get pregnant , men do n't . We need to respect women making a decision that they think is best in their life , " he said . " I 'm not here to dictate to anybody . I 'm not here to judge anybody . " <p> The board specifically was bothered that he did n't give pain medication to all women - only those under 16 and those who could pay extra . And when he did sedate women he did n't have qualified staff to monitor them and did n't follow best practices for administration of the drugs and emergency procedures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board members called amazing and lucky . <p> Klopfer can petition for reinstatement in six months - but only after he completes a laundry list of evaluations , continuing medical education credits and child abuse training . He also was fined $3,000 . <p> The board found him guilty of five of nine charges . One of the charges related to not reporting performing an abortion on two girls under the age of 14 within the three-day required timeline . Two referenced sedation and medical practices ; two others were whether he followed state law requiring informed consent 18 hours before the procedure on a handful of women . <p> " Justice has been done , " said Cathie Humbarger , executive director at Allen County Right to Life . " We 're glad that he 's been held accountable for the inferior medical treatment that he has been responsible for over many , many years . " <p> Indiana Right to Life was instrumental in the procedure after analyzing thousands of terminated pregnancy reports and other required documentation . <p> KIopfer has performed abortions in Fort Wayne , Gary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All three of his abortion clinics have closed but he told the panel he wants to reopen when he can . <p> Mary Watts - Klopfer 's attorney - said the case is about forms and not about the standard of care patients received . <p> " He provided good medical care for his patients and did his best to follow the law , " she said . " It 's a question of documentation . " <p> She said anytime deficiencies were found he corrected the procedure . <p> Klopfer and Watts declined to speak at the conclusion of the hearing . <p> Klopfer began performing abortions in 1973 following the legalization of abortion by Roe v. Wade . <p> He had been affiliated with the Fort Wayne Women 's Health Organization since 1986 and became the owner in 2008 . Klopfer stopped performing abortions in Fort Wayne in January 2014 when he lost a backup physician required to meet the county 's admitting privileges law . <p> The last of his clinics closed in November 2015 . <p> Some of the hearing was spent on surveys by the Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surveyor Linda Plummer did four inspections of the Fort Wayne office and described it as rundown , not well-maintained and older . Some examples of deficiencies included equipment not being properly maintained ; expired medications in an emergency drug kit ; lack of infection control practices ; no log of cleaning procedure rooms and incomplete personnel policies . <p> Plummer also said Klopfer was blunt and abrupt , and described staff as having a " laissez faire " attitude .
