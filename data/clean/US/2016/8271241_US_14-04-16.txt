' old guy ' dingell tired of hearing ' old guy ' sanders yell  john dingell may see some of himself in bernie sanders , but it sounds like he 's heard enough .  the 89-year-old longtime michigan congressman , who retired following the 2014 election after a record-breaking 60 years in the house , is known for his gift of gab on twitter , and he did n't disappoint during thursday night 's democratic debate .  as bernie sanders and hillary clinton fought it out in brooklyn with both increasingly raising their voices , dingell tweeted : " old guy who yells a lot sick of listening to old guy who yells a lot . "  though he did n't name names , we 're going out on a limb that the self-deprecating crack was targeted at sanders .  dingell backs clinton for the democratic nomination , as you may have guessed .
