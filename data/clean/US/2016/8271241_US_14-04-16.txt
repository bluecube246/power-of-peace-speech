' Old guy ' Dingell tired of hearing ' old guy ' Sanders yell  John Dingell may see some of himself in Bernie Sanders , but it sounds like he 's heard enough .  The 89-year-old longtime Michigan congressman , who retired following the 2014 election after a record-breaking 60 years in the House , is known for his gift of gab on Twitter , and he did n't disappoint during Thursday night 's Democratic debate .  As Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton fought it out in Brooklyn with both increasingly raising their voices , Dingell tweeted : " Old Guy Who Yells A Lot Sick Of Listening To Old Guy Who Yells A Lot . "  Though he did n't name names , we 're going out on a limb that the self-deprecating crack was targeted at Sanders .  Dingell backs Clinton for the Democratic nomination , as you may have guessed .
