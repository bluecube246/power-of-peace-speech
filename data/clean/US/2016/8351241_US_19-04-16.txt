<p> The Eelume robot is designed for inspection work and basic repair jobs on the sea floor . This mechanical critter should drive down operational costs and increase productivity ; they 're set to replace expensive vessels , including large and unwieldy autonomous underwater vehicles . They 'll be able to slither and slink their way into areas that are difficult to access with existing technology . <p> The flexible and versatile snakes will swim around undersea equipment , performing inspection duties and simple maintenance and repair tasks , such as cleaning , adjusting valves , and other chores . The bots will work around the clock , attending to issues as they arise . They can swim on their own ( like a real sea snake ) , or use thrusters for propulsion . <p> Image : NUST . <p> The designers have n't disclosed many details about their aquatic worker snake , but these things do n't appear to be self-powered . Those dangling wires could pose a serious limitation in terms of their range -- not to mention problems with tangling . But looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to eventually do away with the power cables altogether .
