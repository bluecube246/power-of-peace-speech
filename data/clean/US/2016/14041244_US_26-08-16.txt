Ascension Parish dials back estimate of house flooding  GONZALES , La . ( AP ) -- Ascension Parish government has significantly reduced its estimate of house flooding , one day after parish officials announced flooding had affected 30,000 to 40,000 homes .  Officials said Thursday revised numbers suggest 16,000 to 19,000 structures were affected to some extent , similar to earlier numbers released about the flooding after historic storms battered the Baton Rouge region .  In an email received by The Advocate ( http : //bit.ly/2c1gjLk ) , parish officials said they were revising their previous statement and the 30,000-to-40,000 homes figure represented only " potential " flooding impact , contradicting statements on Wednesday that in fact those homes were flooded to some extent .  Mike Steele , spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Preparedness , said state officials believe the total statewide figure is sure to exceed 100,000 homes .
