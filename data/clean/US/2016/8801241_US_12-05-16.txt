<h> Hogan ' pleased ' with resignation of school construction chief after air-conditioning dispute <p> Kamenetz says installing portable air conditioners under timetable of Hogan and Franchot would be impossible . <p> Gov . Larry Hogan said Thursday he 's " very pleased " with the decision of the state 's school construction chief to resign amid the ongoing battle over school air conditioning in Baltimore city and county . <p> David Lever has headed the Interagency Committee on School Construction , a state agency that reviews school construction projects and spending , since 2003 . <p> On Wednesday , Lever criticized the vote by Hogan and Comptroller Peter Franchot on the Board of Public Works to withhold $15 million from Baltimore city and county school systems unless they install portable air conditioners in schools over the summer . <p> Lever said the decision politicized school construction funding and prompted his decision to step down , effective in September . <p> Hogan said he 's glad to see him go . <p> At a news conference in Annapolis , the Republican governor called Lever " a major part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with his resignation , " Hogan said . " My only regret is it does n't take effect immediately . <p> " Quite frankly , anyone who has the arrogance and the sense of entitlement that they do n't feel like they have to be accountable for their actions to the Board of Public Works , to the people who are responsible for overseeing these things , does n't deserve to be working in state government , " Hogan said . <p> Lever declined to comment on the governor 's remarks . " I do n't have any response to that , " he said . <p> Hogan 's statement came as politicians continued a war of words over school air-conditioning policies . <p> Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz , a Democrat , issued a lengthy statement defending his position that installing portable air conditioners would be a poor use of taxpayer dollars compared to his plan to install central air conditioning in all schools by 2019 . <p> The state Board of Public Works has voted to hold back millions of dollars in school construction money from Baltimore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classrooms by the start of the next school year . <p> " In his desire to punish Baltimore County and Baltimore City , the Governor intentionally misstated the county 's plan , refused multiple opportunities to be presented with the facts , and disregarded the clear legal advice of the Attorney General of the State of Maryland , " Kamenetz wrote . <p> County officials say it 's logistically impossible to install air conditioners by the deadline set by Hogan and Franchot of the start of the next school year . <p> Kevin Smith , chief administrative and operating officer for the county school system , said state procurement laws outline steps for a project of this scale . The earliest the process could be completed is August 2017 , he said , if it started immediately . <p> The system would have to hire a consultant to design the work and have plans approved by the state , Interagency Committee on School Construction , which could take until fall . If the IAC gives the go-ahead , the school system then would give potential vendors a 30-day period to bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would approve a contract with a vendor . Work could begin in February and wrap up in August , Smith said . <p> There are provisions for speedier procurement for emergencies , he said , " but I do n't know if this qualifies as that . " <p> Hogan does n't buy that argument , said spokesman Douglass Mayer . <p> " For years , the county executive has made excuses for his failure to ensure that all Baltimore County students have access to suitable learning environments , " Mayer said . " It comes as no surprise that he has yet another weak explanation to try and justify the deplorable conditions in these classrooms . No doubt he 'll have even more excuses next week . " <p> Peter Hamm , a spokesman for Franchot , also dismissed the county 's timetable , saying of Kamenetz : " If he wants to make it that hard , he can make it that hard . " <p> Baltimore city and county are the only jurisdictions in the state with a significant number of classrooms that lack air conditioning . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 175 public school buildings lacked air conditioning . In Baltimore , 76 schools lack air conditioning . <p> Hogan and Franchot have criticized leaders of both jurisdictions for not providing air conditioning for classrooms . Franchot , a Democrat , went on the " C4 Show " on WBAL radio Thursday to continue to blast Kamenetz . <p> " The foot-dragging by local elected officials for the last five years is a disgrace , " he said . <p> Franchot said Kamenetz is " committing a mass dereliction of duty " by allowing children to attend schools without air conditioning .
