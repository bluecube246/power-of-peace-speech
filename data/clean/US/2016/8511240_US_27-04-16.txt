<h> Gase not paying attention to report of players upset with Suh <p> On Tuesday , the Dolphins launched the first voluntary minicamp of coach Adam Gase 's tenure . Defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh did not volunteer to attend . <p> Some teammates who chose to be there reportedly were upset with Suh . During a Wednesday visit to PFT Live on NBC Sports Radio , I asked Gase for his reaction to that report . <p> " Anytime you hear reports like this , it 's hard to pay attention to it because I feel like I have a good enough relationship with our players to where if they have a problem with something , my door 's wide open and if somebody has an issue with somebody else they know where to come , " Gase said . " So unless I have one of those situations come up , which I have n't , then that 's something I really do n't want to worry about . " <p> It does n't mean the situation wo n't land on Gase 's radar screen with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , it has n't . <p> If you have n't heard everything Gase had to say , download Hour Two of today 's podcast at t iTunes or audioBoom .

He 's a big jerk and I 'm glad he 's gone . He 's a cancer and I bet they try and trade him next off season and eventually cut him . -- -- -- And they went from top 3 to giving up more points per game than Miami . <p> I 'm beginning to think that if all us Miami fans got to cherry-pick every player &amp; coach we wanted for this roster -- there 'd still be a majority of fans screamin ' on PFT that " the sky is falling " for one reason or another .... you guys really crack me up .... new season has n't even started &amp; your all ready to pack it in -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day over the likes of Rex Ryan &amp; Co. or Bill Bechacheats bunch ..... sorry I wo n't include the Jets , cause Todd Bowles is a 1st class coach . <p> valentino8100 says:Apr 27 , 2016 3:22 PM <p> Do n't blame Gase here . The Dolphins organization did n't simply need a new HC -it needs a complete purging from top to beginning beginning with the sale of the team to competent ownership . <p> WonderlicWizard says : Apr 27 , 2016 2:11 PM one of the most selfish players in NFL history <p> This guy is just bitter Suh does n't play for his team . <p> markeyh says:Apr 27 , 2016 3:50 PM <p> This is typical of the Miami media they are drama queens and look for any drama related story ( like not naming names ) to start trouble , Suh will come to camp in great shape and this will be what it is much to do about nothing ! <p> " Anytime you hear reports like this , it 's hard to pay attention to it because I feel like I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has talked to a few players for less than an hour . These voluntary workouts are the 1st time any meaningful contact has been allowed <p> To those emphasizing its voluntary . You 're absolutely right . What 's also absolutely right is when most , if not all , of your teammates show up and you do n't it sents a clear message . Just the way it is.
