<h> Texas , facing a lawsuit , makes it easier for U.S.-born children of immigrants to get birth certificates <p> Texas birth certificates <p> Eric Gay / Associated Press <p> A woman in Sullivan City , Texas , who said she entered the country illegally shows the footprints of her daughter , who was born in the United States but was denied a birth certificate . <p> A woman in Sullivan City , Texas , who said she entered the country illegally shows the footprints of her daughter , who was born in the United States but was denied a birth certificate . ( Eric Gay / Associated Press ) <p> Molly Hennessy-Fiske <p> Last year , a group of Central American and Mexican immigrant parents sued Texas in federal court , claiming that the state had denied their children birth certificates and access to vital services . <p> Now , Texas officials have agreed to expand the list of documents that allow immigrant parents who entered the country illegally to obtain birth certificates for their U.S.-born children . The parents ' lawsuit has now been stayed pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It is a victory absolutely for all of the U.S. citizen children who are born here in Texas to undocumented parents . I think they are going to get all their benefits to which they are entitled , " said lead attorney Jennifer Harbury of Texas RioGrande Legal Aid Inc. , which represented the children . " We have a great deal of work to do in the transition state . But I think in the end , we 're going to get a better system out of it . " <p> The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship for children born on U.S. soil , but Texas authorities added significant barriers in recent years to undocumented immigrants seeking birth certificates for U.S.-born children . <p> Hundreds of immigrant parents along the southern Texas border have been denied birth certificates during the last three years , the families ' attorneys said , as authorities made it more difficult for those lacking access to U.S.-issued identification to use alternatives . <p> " Without birth certificates , our clients lived in constant fear of having their families torn apart and their American-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic education , health and child-care services , " said Efr ? n Olivares , regional legal director of Texas Civil Rights Project 's south Texas office , which represented the parents . " This settlement will be life-changing for immigrant communities across the state . " <p> The stricter guidelines came as the state saw an influx during the last two years of Central American migrant family members into the Rio Grande Valley -- 34,289 since October -- and President Obama attempted to expand executive action immigration programs ultimately blocked by the U.S. Supreme court last month . <p> According to state policy , registrars could not accept consular identification cards , popularly known as matriculas , issued to foreign nationals . Many immigrant parents in the country illegally did not bring identification issued in their home countries , lost them or had them stolen when they migrated , and could not return home to get them . <p> In California , immigrant parents routinely use the matricula card to obtain birth certificates . In Arizona , lawmakers failed in recent years to pass proposals that would have denied or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country illegally . <p> Under the agreement , Texas registrars still will not accept matriculas , Harbury said . But they must accept two supporting documents and a form of secondary identification from immigrant parents , such as a Mexican voter registration card or Salvadoran national identification . <p> Though the agreement does n't change state law or policies , " it expands the list of supporting documents significantly to include documents available to undocumented people , " Olivares said . <p> The state already accepted Mexican voter ID cards , but until this year , the Mexican government did n't issue them in the U.S. Olivares said the attorneys negotiated with the state to accept the new cards issued to Mexican migrants in the U.S. <p> Some of the families that sued have documents that meet the new criteria and are reapplying for birth certificates . Others are applying for identification from their home countries , which Olivares said would probably take several weeks . <p> " We have n't had any test runs yet , " he said , adding , " That 's one of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state or the local registrars are not compliant , we can take it back to the judge . Hopefully no one will be turned away . " <p> The agreement comes at a time when birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants has been challenged by Donald Trump and other conservatives . <p> " This is yet another example of how our institutions are being asked to accommodate foreigners who think they are above the law , " said Jon Feere , legal policy analyst at the conservative Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies . " This entire issue could be avoided if people entered our country lawfully . Texas officials now are expected to become experts in a variety of foreign documents of questionable reliability . " <p> A spokeswoman for Republican Texas Atty . Gen. Ken Paxton 's office , which handled the case , referred questions to the Department of State Health Services , the agency that supervises the roughly 400 local registrars across Texas that issue birth certificates . <p> Chris Van Deusen , a department spokesman , said the agreement " will allow the state to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in a way that maintains the security of state birth records . " <p> He said the department would accept " certifications " issued by Salvadoran consulates as secondary identification and was reviewing documents provided by the consulates of Guatemala and Honduras . <p> In addition to accepting more forms of identification , Texas officials also agreed to train registrars , create posters and pamphlets explaining the requirements , and add a hotline for complaints that staff will review , Harbury said , " making sure the rules are consistently applied . " <p> While the lawsuit has made its way through the courts , Harbury said , some of the children who were unable to get birth certificates missed out on medical services , while others had trouble registering for Head Start or Section 8 housing . <p> " I 'm hoping to get all of that straightened out in the next few weeks , " she said . <p> State Sen. Juan " Chuy " Hinojosa , a Democrat from the Rio Grande Valley who had called on state officials to change birth certificate requirements after the lawsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right direction . " <p> " I 'm pleased that the state will now expand the types of documents that parents can present to obtain birth certificates for their children born in the United States , " Hinojosa said . " These children are U.S. citizens and are entitled constitutionally to receive their own birth certificates . " <p> Juanita Valdez-Cox , executive director of the nonprofit La Union del Pueblo Entero office near the border in San Juan , Texas , held a news briefing about the agreement at her office Monday with some of the families who filed the lawsuit . <p> " This is a critical victory for immigrant families , but it is also a victory for the constitutional rights of all of us , " Valdez-Cox said . " Questioning the citizenship of U.S.-born , citizen children of immigrant parents erodes our constitutional freedoms and protections , causes instability for parents and children , and undermines the guarantee that all of our children will unquestionably be citizens . " <p> She noted that more than 48,000 people signed petitions asking the state to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a handmade sign that said in Spanish , " My children need their birth certificate , " Valdez-Cox pointed to one of the mothers previously denied . <p> " She has since already received her voter card , which they said will be accepted , " Valdez-Cox said , as those assembled applauded .
