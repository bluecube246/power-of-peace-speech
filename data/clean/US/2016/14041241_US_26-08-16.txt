<p> Vulnerabilities in the Apple iOS sandboxing feature could be exploited by attackers <p> Researchers across three universities have discovered seven classes of vulnerabilities in the sandboxing feature of Apple 's iOS operating system , which if exploited could allow malicious actors to launch a bevy of attacks that would place an iPhone or iPad user 's privacy and data at risk . <p> This sandbox uses a set profile , which Apple refers to as a " container , " that acts as an interface for third-party applications , granting each one parameter-based permissions for what actions they can take and what data they can access . It also is designed to confine any malicious or exploited third-party applications . <p> However , academics at North Carolina State University , Germany 's Technische Universitat Darmstadt and Romania 's University Politehnica of Bucharest announced this week that they have found flaws in the sandbox 's code that could allow unscrupulous third-party developers -- or bad actors who have secretly compromised their apps -- to perform multiple unauthorized acts on iOS devices . <p> Specifically , attackers could exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up location search histories , access system file metadata , obtain a user 's name and media library , consume disk storage space ( in such a manner that uninstalling the app wo n't recover it ) , block access to system resources , and allow apps to share information with each other without permission . An NC State press release states that the exploits affect " nonjailbroken devices running later versions of iOS -- including 9.0.2 , the version that underwent the study . <p> " Many people think that the closed operating system from Apple is more secure than the open Android system , said Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi , another researcher and professor of computer science at Technische Universitat Darmstadt , in a university press release . To test the validity of this theory , the researchers decided to have a closer look at one of key security features in iOS : the sandbox . " Our goal was to see if we could automate the detection of security vulnerabilities , " Sadeghi said . <p> To accomplish this , the researchers created a process called " SandScout " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into readable form , and model it using logic programming language so that they could perform a series of automated queries on the coding , looking for potential abuse scenarios . For instance : perhaps some " third-party applications have access to things that maybe you would n't want them to have access to , " said William Enck , one of the researchers and an associate professor of computer science at NC State . Or perhaps they have been granted write access , which " might cause some corruptions . " <p> The researchers will flesh out the vulnerabilities in more detail in an upcoming academic research paper , " SandScout : Automatic Detection of Flaws in iOS Sandbox Profiles , " which is set for release during the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security , scheduled to take place in Vienna from Oct. 24-28 . Authorship of the upcoming academic paper is credited to Enck and Sadeghi , as well as researchers Luke Deshotels , Mihai Chiroiu , Razvan Deaconescu and Lucas Davi . <p> Until then , researchers are withholding certain key details while Apple works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been actively engaging with Apple and expect the company to eventually issue security patches . " They hope to have many of these problems fixed in iOS 10 , " said Enck . " We have n't been able to review their fixes yet , but we have had discussions with them . Some of the things sound like they 're not going to have complete fixes in 10 , but they are aware of the problem and so they can look for apps that are abusing them . " <p> The explosive growth in ransomware has once again heated up the debate as to whether infected organizations have an ethical responsibility to refuse payment . But are some companies exacerbating the ... <p> SC Magazine arms information security professionals with the in-depth , unbiased business and technical information they need to tackle the countless security challenges they face and establish risk management and compliance postures that underpin overall business strategies .
