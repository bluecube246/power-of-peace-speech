George R.R. Martin 's Idea for a Game of Thrones Spin-Off  George R.R. Martin 's idea for a Game of Thrones spin-off  The 10-episode sixth season of Game of Thrones is premiering on HBO this Sunday , April 24 , and if showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss go through with their plan to potentially wrap up the show with 13 more episodes , that will leave a dragon-sized hole in HBO 's programming lineup . With shows like Fear the Walking Dead and Better Call Saul gaining popularity , a spin-off seems like a no-brainer , and Entertainment Weekly is reporting that " A Song of Ice and Fire " creator George R.R. Martin may have already written the ideal one .  " The most natural follow-up would be an adaptation of my ' Dunk &amp; Egg ' stories , " says Martin of his trio of novellas collected in the anthology A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms . Set 90 years before the current saga , these stories center on " hedge knight " Ser Duncan the Tall ( later a member King Aegon V Targaryen of Westeros and father of " Mad King " Aerys II ) .  " Each of the novellas could easily be done as a two-hour stand-alone movie for television ; that would probably be the ideal way to do them , rather than as an ongoing weekly series , " added Martin . " ' The Hedge Knight ' and its sequels are lighter in tone than ' A Song of Ice and Fire , ' more in the realm of action/adventure . "  Based on the popular book series " A Song of Ice and Fire , " by George R.R. Martin , the hit Emmy-winning fantasy series chronicles an epic struggle for power in a vast and violent kingdom . The ensemble cast for the fifth season included Emmy and Golden Globe winner Peter Dinklage , Nikolaj Coster-Waldau , Lena Headey , Emilia Clarke , Aidan Gillen , Kit Harington , Diana Rigg , Natalie Dormer , Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner . Former " Deadwood " star Ian McShane is also set to guest star in Game of Thrones season six . vacuum that protagonists across Westeros and Essos were looking to fill . At Castle Black , Jon Snow struggled to balance the demands of the Night 's Watch with those of newly-arrived Stannis Baratheon , who styles himself the rightful king of Westeros . Meanwhile , Cersei scrabbled to hold on to power in King 's Landing amidst the Tyrells and the rise of a religious group led by the enigmatic High Sparrow , while Jaime embarked on a secret mission . Across the Narrow Sea , Arya sought an old friend while a fugitive Tyrion found a new cause . And as danger mounts in Meereen , Daenerys Targaryen found that her tenuous hold on the city requires some hard sacrifices .
