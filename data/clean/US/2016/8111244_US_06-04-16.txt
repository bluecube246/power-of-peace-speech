<h> iPhone Owners ' Dreams of Hiding Default Apps May Soon Come True <p> A little ferreting around in the unseen infrastructure of the latest version of Apple 's iTunes software has turned up some potentially great news for iPhone owners . <p> Apple aapl has added two new metadata tags for apps in iTunes , one called " isFirstParty " and the other " isFirstPartyHideableApp , " according to a post on AppAdvice .

So I recognize that some people want to do this , and it 's something we 're looking at .
