iphone owners ' dreams of hiding default apps may soon come true  a little ferreting around in the unseen infrastructure of the latest version of apple 's itunes software has turned up some potentially great news for iphone owners .  apple aapl has added two new metadata tags for apps in itunes , one called " isfirstparty " and the other " isfirstpartyhideableapp , " according to a post on appadvice . that strongly implies that at least some of apple 's own " first party " apps will become removable from the screens of the millions of iphone owners who have no use for apps like tips , podcasts , apple watch , and compass .  some users have resorted to throwing all the unwanted -- and unremovable -- apple apps in a folder labeled " junk " or worse .  of course , apple has not yet said anything about the new metadata tags publicly . fortune reached out to apple for comment and will update this story if any is received .  as the appadvice post noted , apple apps last year in an interview with buzzfeed , revealing that the company was aware of the problem and would move to resolve it . as cook said in the interview :  " this is a more complex issue than it first appears . there are some apps that are linked to something else on the iphone . if they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone . there are other apps that are n't like that . so over time , i think with the ones that are n't like that , we 'll figure out a way for you to remove them . ... it 's not that we want to suck up your real estate ; we 're not motivated to do that . we want you to be happy . so i recognize that some people want to do this , and it 's something we 're looking at . "  at least based on the new additions to itunes , however , it looks like apple has conquered the complexity and will provide some relief to users fed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @
