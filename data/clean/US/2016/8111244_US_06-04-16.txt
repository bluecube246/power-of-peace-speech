iPhone Owners ' Dreams of Hiding Default Apps May Soon Come True  A little ferreting around in the unseen infrastructure of the latest version of Apple 's iTunes software has turned up some potentially great news for iPhone owners .  Apple aapl has added two new metadata tags for apps in iTunes , one called " isFirstParty " and the other " isFirstPartyHideableApp , " according to a post on AppAdvice . That strongly implies that at least some of Apple 's own " first party " apps will become removable from the screens of the millions of iPhone owners who have no use for apps like Tips , Podcasts , Apple Watch , and Compass .  Some users have resorted to throwing all the unwanted -- and unremovable -- Apple apps in a folder labeled " junk " or worse .  Of course , Apple has not yet said anything about the new metadata tags publicly . Fortune reached out to Apple for comment and will update this story if any is received .  As the AppAdvice post noted , Apple apps last year in an interview with Buzzfeed , revealing that the company was aware of the problem and would move to resolve it . As Cook said in the interview :  " This is a more complex issue than it first appears . There are some apps that are linked to something else on the iPhone . If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone . There are other apps that are n't like that . So over time , I think with the ones that are n't like that , we 'll figure out a way for you to remove them . ... It 's not that we want to suck up your real estate ; we 're not motivated to do that . We want you to be happy . So I recognize that some people want to do this , and it 's something we 're looking at . "  At least based on the new additions to iTunes , however , it looks like Apple has conquered the complexity and will provide some relief to users fed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @
