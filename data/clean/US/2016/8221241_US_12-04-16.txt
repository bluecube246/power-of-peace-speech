<p> A construction crew ripped open a 30-inch city water line at Interstate 4 and Colonial Drive in Orlando on Tuesday , sending a tower of water 12 feet into the air , flooding a street and , for a few hours , requiring thousands of people downtown to stop drinking tap water . <p> The break prompted a private school to send students home early , and for a time , everyone at all 14 downtown Orange County facilities -- including judges , lawyers and felons at the courthouse -- to stop drinking tap water . <p> The Orlando Utilities Commission , owner of the water line , issued a precautionary boil water order shortly before noon for much of downtown but later scaled back . <p> By mid-afternoon , all county facilities were given the all-clear , and OUC spokesman Tim Trudell said at that point only about 50 customers were affected , mostly businesses within a quarter mile radius of the break . <p> Still that includes residents of two major apartment complexes on Orange Avenue north of Colonial Drive that are home to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SteelHouse Apartments . <p> An I-4 construction crew ruptured a line downtown , sending water gushing into the air and prompting a boil-water alert . <p> Also under the boil-water order : the 40 employees at the U.S. Attorney 's Office on West Washington Street , said spokesman William Daniels . <p> In general , customers should boil their water if they are north of Concord Street , south of Marks Street , west of Orange Avenue and east of Lexington Avenue , Trudell said . <p> The accident happened about 10 a.m. on the northeast corner of I-4 and Colonial Drive , one of the busiest interchanges in Orlando . <p> A crew from SGL Constructors , the main contractor on the mammoth I-4 makeover , had dug down to the line as part of its assignment to rebuild the interchange , said Dave Parks , a consultant with the Florida Department of Transportation , which is in charge of the six-year project . <p> The crew could see the 30-inch water line , Parks said . <p> " They were in the process of placing a steel trench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " The box somehow hit the water line . " <p> That punched a hole in it , sending water gushing 12 to 15 feet into the air , a sight that prompted motorists to stop and take photographs . <p> No one was hurt , Parks said . <p> The temporary water emergency prompted St. James Cathedral School to dismiss classes for the rest of the day shortly after noon . <p> For some customers , water pressure dropped so low the utility could no longer guarantee that its tap water was safe , so it advised them to boil water before drinking it . <p> Only one OUC customer lost all water service , Trudell said , but many downtown saw their water pressure drop as crews slowed the flow of water to make the repair .
