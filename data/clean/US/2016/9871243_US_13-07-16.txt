Pahrump woman arrested , accused of voter registration fraud  Voter ballot  PAHRUMP , Nev . ( AP ) - A Pahrump woman who registered people to vote outside of Wal-Marts and grocery stores has been arrested on suspicion of falsifying registration forms .  Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske said Wednesday that 45-year-old Tina Marie Parks was arrested on suspicion of 11 felony counts . Nye County sheriff 's officials said she was in custody Wednesday , although it was n't clear if she had an attorney .  A criminal complaint accuses Parks of fraudulently marking " Republican " or " nonpartisan " on forms of people who said they were Democrats . That prevented at least one person from voting in the June 14 primary .  The complaint also accuses her of trying to register herself , even though she has felony convictions and does n't have the right to vote .  Cegavske encouraged Nye County voters to verify their registrations are accurate .  ( Copyright 2016 The Associated Press . All rights reserved .
