<h> ' Game Of Thrones ' Star Supports A Secret HBO Conspiracy <h> Conspiracy ? You 're Dorne tootin ' . <p> When you play the " Game of Thrones , " you win or you get completely tricked by HBO , according to the former ruler of Dorne . <p> Actor Alexander Siddig played Prince Doran Martell in Seasons 5 and 6 . In a recent interview with StarTrek.com , he opened up about the intense secrecy surrounding the show , suggesting the network actively sends out misinformation in order to misdirect fans . He threw out some shocking support for an HBO conspiracy : <p> Last season , I believe that the first few episodes were stolen and downloaded online , and everybody got to see them before the show actually aired , and everybody was furious at HBO and whatnot . I do n't know if you remember . I am almost positive that those four episodes were leaked by HBO themselves . <p> Could HBO have actually leaked the episodes by itself ? " Game of Thrones " certainly does n't need episode-by-episode reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " leak " got a ton of free publicity . It might have been a clever PR move . <p> The only thing that does n't fit is why HBO was supposedly tracking down people who had watched the leaked material . That could simply be a cover up , though . <p> Siddig says there is " an enormous amount of spin going on " surrounding the show , but he adds that the conspiracy idea is just his own opinion . <p> It makes sense that the actor who plays Prince Doran would be into conspiracies . In the books , his character is busy scheming behind the scenes , which the show did n't allow him time to do . <p> Siddig admits he 's " not really sure " why he was killed off so soon ? in the Season 6 premiere . Apparently , the actor was contracted to appear in four episodes of that season ; however , during the phone call in which showrunners told him when his character would die , he learned they had originally planned to kill him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If they were going to kill me off at the end of the last season why would they contract me for those four episodes ? " asked Siddig . <p> The actor speculates that he might 've been killed off because he said the wrong thing to someone in charge . Sure , that 's possible . From the beginning , though , the Dorne storyline was criticized heavily by fans for less-than-spectacular characters and fight sequences : <p> Yeah , people were n't happy with that . <p> Unlike the leaked episodes , there 's likely no conspiracy for Siddig 's early exit . All disappointing plot lines must die .
