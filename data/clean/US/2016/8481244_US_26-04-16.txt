<p> Statoil and EON will invest more than 1.2 billion euros ( $1.4 billion ) in the project , which lies 35 kilometers ( 56 miles ) off the German island of Ruegen , the Stavanger-based company said in an e-mailed statement . Electricity production is scheduled to start in 2019 and will power as many as 400,000 households , it said . Siemens AG will supply the turbines . <p> " There 's no getting around for the big utilities to gear up investments in renewable power , " said Christopher Rodler , an analyst at equity researchers Montega AG in Hamburg , by phone . " Financial clout and staying power is needed for offshore . " <p> The project is Statoil 's first wind-power venture outside the U.K. , where it holds a stake in the Sheringham Shoal wind farm , the company 's only commercial wind project in production . For EON , it 's the second large-scale renewable power development announced in as many months and is part of a strategy to invest as much as 1.5 billion euros annually in new clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant investment in a relatively demanding financial situation for Statoil , " Irene Rummelhoff , executive vice president of the New Energy Solutions unit , said at a press conference in Oslo . " It shows we 're committed to building up a complementary renewables business in addition to oil and gas . " <p> At the end of last year , Statoil made a final investment decision on the 2 billion-kroner ( $243 million ) Hywind Scotland project , the world 's first floating wind farm . Statoil has also decided to go ahead with the Dudgeon project in 2014 and is a partner on two Dogger Bank projects , which were approved by the U.K. in 2015 . <p> The investment is a milestone for the Norwegian company 's New Energy Solutions business unit , which was set up by Chief Executive Officer Eldar Saetre after he succeeded Helge Lund at the end of 2014 . Statoil , one of Europe 's top producers of oil and natural gas , said it will now be able to deliver renewable energy to more than 1 million households in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing about 20 billion kroner in offshore-wind projects from 2012 to 2019 , and that figure is likely to rise , Ms. Rummelhoff said in an interview after the press conference . Statoil is currently working with auction processes in Denmark , the Netherlands , Germany and France . Its executives have visited the U.S. to consider offshore wind work , where the company sees a " very positive development , " she said . <p> While the company has a goal of using its offshore competence to seek opportunities in renewables energy , it has said these projects will have to compete with traditional fossil-fuel projects in its portfolio on the basis of profitability at a time where the company is reducing spending because of a collapse in crude prices . <p> " We see enormously exciting opportunities and strong growth " in the wind power industry , Ms. Rummelhoff said . " We wish to participate -- not to green-wash Statoil , but because we see real and good business opportunities . ' <p> The deal also means that Germany could exceed its renewable energy targets , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Germany will beat their original target of 6.5 gigawatts installed offshore wind by 2020 and get closer to the revised 7.7-gigawatt target announced last week , " BNEF wind analyst Tom Harries said . " The Baltics are known to have lower capacity factors than the North Sea but an easier working climate for installation and maintenance access .
