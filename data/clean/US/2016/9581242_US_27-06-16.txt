brands : learn the language to get the most out of social  the rise of digital , and social media in particular , has opened loads of new pathways for brands and consumers to connect , with even more platforms continuing to emerge . but the nature of these new channels has changed the way brands and consumers connect and , therefore , it comes with a whole new set of rules .  luckily , the common denominator is pretty simple : be human . ok , to be fair , brands ca n't really be human , and proposing that they could be shows no respect to humanity . so what 's a brand to do ? being self-aware enough to understand your role in the conversation is a good place to start . here are some things to keep in mind :  it 's not about you  with social media in particular , people use it to escape , even if only for a few moments . they escape by connecting with their friends , or people they wish were their 's important to keep that in mind when you try to interject . we 've all met some jerk at a party who keeps interrupting and trying to change the topic of conversation to themselves . no one likes that jerk , so do n't be that jerk .  add something valuable  ever been in a group conversation with someone who keeps chiming in , always a little off-topic , and it seems like they do n't quite get what 's going on , but they desperately want to be included ? you do n't want to be that poor wretch , either . spend some time listening to the conversations that are happening , and ask yourself honestly if you have something valuable to add . no , truly stop and ask yourself : if i were talking with my friend about x , and someone else interjected with y , would i appreciate it , or get annoyed ? now think about how you want users to feel about your brand .  listen before speaking  every digital channel , just like every conversation , has customs are often fluid and may not be immediately apparent to an outsider . at first glance , snapchat is all about video . so would a cut-down of a highly produced broadcast spot make sense there ? no , it would n't . pay attention to the nuance of the language .  another example : people are communicating with emojis everywhere , but does it make sense for your brand to use emojis ? does it come naturally ? do you know all of the double-entendres associated with your chosen emoji ? spend some time watching and listening to get to know the local customs before you inadvertently make a faux pas . credibility is your brand 's backbone : do n't risk it over something silly .  mind your manners  if you 're noticing a pattern here , it 's that these are all basically ground rules for partaking in civilized conversation . this sometimes requires sensitivity . as much as a brand wants to find a relevant way to join conversations , it 's equally important to know when to shut up . no one 's passing or national disaster . even if the sentiment is kind , too often it comes off as opportunistic and tacky . sometimes the best way to show respect is by staying silent .  be yourself  every other item on this list is about understanding others , but all is for naught if you do n't understand yourself . every brand has something honest and valuable to offer , and that 's what you should be talking about . because all of this is really about making connections based on common values , and if you 're true to yourself , the people who share your values will take notice .  when you 're planning a social campaign or any sort of communication on the web , keep these things in mind . remember that your brand will never be human , but a little situational and self-awareness goes a long way toward ensuring that people can connect with you on a human level .  ethan martin is the director of user strategy at digital agency bukwild .  subscribe to adweek  featured courses  and digital outreachlearn more &gt;digital content strategyapply your editorial skills to create an effective content strategylearn more &gt;copywriting for social mediamaximize your clicks , shares , retweets , and pinlearn more &gt;skills in 60 : how to name your brand or productdevelop a unique name for any brand , product , or businesslearn more &gt;see more courses &gt;
