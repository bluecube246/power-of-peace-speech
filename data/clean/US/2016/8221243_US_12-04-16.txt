<h> 0 <p> Yuri Milner is pushing forward with the hunt for intelligent alien life beyond our planet , and is investing another $100 million in a more proactive approach after putting up the original $100m last year . <p> In July of 2015 , Milner and I sat down and discussed the greatest question of all . In the mind of this legendary investor , that question is " are we alone ? " To get to the answer , he invested $100 million in a project called Breakthrough Initiatives , with the first phase being dubbed Breakthrough Listen . Breakthrough Listen uses two of the most powerful telescopes on the planet to listen , across multiple frequencies , to the signals within the universe . <p> No , Milner has not yet found proof of extraterrestrial life via Breakthrough Listen . However , he ( in conjunction with Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg ) is ready to announce the second phase of this project , called Breakthrough Starshot . <p> Advancements in technology have allowed for a very unique form of exploration , and Milner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Breakthrough Starshot is unlike anything ever launched into space . <p> The project includes a collection of gram-scale nanocraft space ships , equipped with sensors , a laser to transmit information back to Earth , robotics to steer , and a camera . These space ships wo n't be propelled by a rocket , but light itself . <p> There are three fundamental pieces of this project , all of which have recently become possible through breakthroughs in technology . <h> Latest Crunch Report <p> The first is a gram-scale wafer . Moore 's law has allowed for powerful computation at a very small scale . Because of that , Milner says scientists and technologists will be able to build a fully functional space probe , complete with lasers , communications systems , and cameras , all smaller than the palm of your hand . <p> The second part of the mission requires a light sail . Thanks to new discoveries in metamaterials , the team will be able to build a sail that is only a few hundred atoms thick , a few meters wide , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attached to the nanocraft and pushed by ... ( you guessed it ! ) light ! <p> The final piece of the puzzle is a light beam , or a very powerful laser . This is by far the most expensive and difficult component , but thanks to the ability to sync a number of smaller lasers , it is now possible to build a light beam strong enough to push these nanocraft up into space . <p> Once in space , and headed the right direction , inertia will do the rest . <p> Because the nanocraft are so small , and susceptible to interference from interstellar dust , etc. , Milner plans to send a few hundred into space to ensure that a few make it to their intended destination of the <p> But where are they headed ? <p> Alpha Centauri , the closest star system to our own solar system , where there is a potential to find intelligent life . <h> CrunchBase <p> BioYuri started investing in Internet companies in 1999 . In 2005 , he founded Digital Sky Technologies , Limited ( now DST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian speaking world . Under his leadership , Mail.ru Group performed approximately 75 transactions and built what is now the leading Russian language website in terms of users . Mail.ru Group is also the seventh most popular ... <p> Upon launch , which is still years away , it would take the fleet of tiny spacecraft 20 years to reach the star system , and messages from the laser-based on-board communication system would take another four years to receive here on earth . In a best case situation , we 'd still be waiting upwards of 25 years to hear back . <p> However , it would take today 's fastest spacecraft 30,000 years to accomplish the same feat . <p> This will certainly be a difficult and expensive undertaking , yet I 'm told that this project will be no more expensive or impossible than any of the most expensive scientific experiments currently underway . <p> Though this latest investment is just the first phase , and focused on research and development , Breakthrough Starshot is dedicated to transparency and openness throughout the life of the project . That way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we inch closer to discovering extraterrestrial life . <p> The program will be led by Pete Worden , the former director of NASA AMES Research Center , and the board will consist of Hawking , Milner , and Mark Zuckerberg . <p> Milner and Hawking are unveiling the initiative at a press conference right now .
