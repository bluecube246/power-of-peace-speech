0  yuri milner is pushing forward with the hunt for intelligent alien life beyond our planet , and is investing another $100 million in a more proactive approach after putting up the original $100m last year .  in july of 2015 , milner and i sat down and discussed the greatest question of all . in the mind of this legendary investor , that question is " are we alone ? " to get to the answer , he invested $100 million in a project called breakthrough initiatives , with the first phase being dubbed breakthrough listen . breakthrough listen uses two of the most powerful telescopes on the planet to listen , across multiple frequencies , to the signals within the universe .  no , milner has not yet found proof of extraterrestrial life via breakthrough listen . however , he ( in conjunction with stephen hawking and mark zuckerberg ) is ready to announce the second phase of this project , called breakthrough starshot .  advancements in technology have allowed for a very unique form of exploration , and milner is .  breakthrough starshot is unlike anything ever launched into space .  the project includes a collection of gram-scale nanocraft space ships , equipped with sensors , a laser to transmit information back to earth , robotics to steer , and a camera . these space ships wo n't be propelled by a rocket , but light itself .  there are three fundamental pieces of this project , all of which have recently become possible through breakthroughs in technology .  latest crunch report  the first is a gram-scale wafer . moore 's law has allowed for powerful computation at a very small scale . because of that , milner says scientists and technologists will be able to build a fully functional space probe , complete with lasers , communications systems , and cameras , all smaller than the palm of your hand .  the second part of the mission requires a light sail . thanks to new discoveries in metamaterials , the team will be able to build a sail that is only a few hundred atoms thick , a few meters wide , and as be attached to the nanocraft and pushed by ... ( you guessed it ! ) light !  the final piece of the puzzle is a light beam , or a very powerful laser . this is by far the most expensive and difficult component , but thanks to the ability to sync a number of smaller lasers , it is now possible to build a light beam strong enough to push these nanocraft up into space .  once in space , and headed the right direction , inertia will do the rest .  because the nanocraft are so small , and susceptible to interference from interstellar dust , etc. , milner plans to send a few hundred into space to ensure that a few make it to their intended destination of the  but where are they headed ?  alpha centauri , the closest star system to our own solar system , where there is a potential to find intelligent life .  crunchbase  bioyuri started investing in internet companies in 1999 . in 2005 , he founded digital sky technologies , limited ( now dst russian speaking world . under his leadership , mail.ru group performed approximately 75 transactions and built what is now the leading russian language website in terms of users . mail.ru group is also the seventh most popular ...  upon launch , which is still years away , it would take the fleet of tiny spacecraft 20 years to reach the star system , and messages from the laser-based on-board communication system would take another four years to receive here on earth . in a best case situation , we 'd still be waiting upwards of 25 years to hear back .  however , it would take today 's fastest spacecraft 30,000 years to accomplish the same feat .  this will certainly be a difficult and expensive undertaking , yet i 'm told that this project will be no more expensive or impossible than any of the most expensive scientific experiments currently underway .  though this latest investment is just the first phase , and focused on research and development , breakthrough starshot is dedicated to transparency and openness throughout the life of the project . that way as we inch closer to discovering extraterrestrial life .  the program will be led by pete worden , the former director of nasa ames research center , and the board will consist of hawking , milner , and mark zuckerberg .  milner and hawking are unveiling the initiative at a press conference right now . you can check out a live stream of the event right here .
