<h> Is the DNC Hack an Act of War ? <h> And is the U.S. prepared to defend itself from the foreign powers who would meddle in our elections ? <p> If Russia is behind the DNC hacks , how should we respond ? ( John Kerry and Vladimir Putin in December . ) <p> Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images <p> On Monday , the FBI announced that it was investigating the hack into the Democratic National Committee . At about the same time , it was also reported that FBI officials believe that the hack was committed by the Russian government , and was undertaken with the intent of aiding Donald Trump 's presidential campaign . ( The release of the stolen data by WikiLeaks has already caused discord in the Democratic Party on the eve of its convention in Philadelphia ; over the weekend , the chair of the DNC , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , resigned from her post . ) As Franklin Foer reported in Slate , Trump has a long history of cozying up to Russia and its leader , Vladimir Putin . ( Trump recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations if a member state was attacked by Russia . ) And Putin has his own long history of attempting to undermine the West by supporting right-wing candidates . <p> To discuss the DNC hack , I corresponded over email with Jack Goldsmith , a Harvard Law School professor and fellow at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution . A former member of President George W. Bush 's Justice Department , he is also the author of several books on executive power and 21st century warfare . In the course of our discussion , which has been edited and condensed , we discussed the difficulty of assigning responsibility for a cyberattack , the history of countries meddling in foreign elections , and whether Russia is the only American adversary to be worried about . <p> Advertisement <p> Isaac Chotiner : How credible is it that Russia was behind the breach ? <p> Jack Goldsmith : Reports attributing the breach to Russia have been pouring out all day . The New York Times said that private researchers had concluded that this hack was done by the same Russian intelligence services that recently breached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emails indicated that documents passed through Russian computers . Other news services have said the FBI suspects the Russians . I have no basis to question these reports . But the truth is that there is no public evidence whatsoever tying Russia to the hack . Attribution for cyberoperations of this sort is very tricky and tends to take some time . Even if the hack can be linked to computers in Russia , that does not show that the hack originated there ( as opposed to being routed through there ) . And even if it originated in Russia it does not show who was responsible . That said , it would not be surprising if the Russians were behind this . In addition to today 's reports , the director of national intelligence warned months ago about intrusions into campaign networks , and Russian intelligence services and criminal networks have reportedly infiltrated important U.S government networks in the last year . But to repeat , there is no public evidence yet -- all we have are reports by private firms and anonymous government officials . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? <p> It depends on what you mean by " this kind of thing . " One of the first ever CIA covert operations was designed to influence the Italian elections of 1948 to ensure that the Communists did not win , and there are several now-public examples of U.S. covert operations to influence foreign elections over the years . The United States is also a global leader in espionage and data theft in foreign governmental networks . And all major powers , including the United States , engage in information operations in various contexts . Note that a few months ago Putin attributed the Panama Papers disclosures to the United States : " We now know from WikiLeaks that officials and state agencies in the United States are behind all this . " <p> Advertisement <p> Is the election aspect of this hack unique ? <p> There have been reports in recent years of cyberattacks or cyberoperations in computer networks in other countries related to elections . Still , if this if a Russian ( or some other foreign governmental ) operation , I know of nothing parallel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I wrote this morning , " the Russian hack of the DNC was small beans compared to the destruction of the integrity of a national election result . " Presumably the DNC email hack and leak involve genuine emails . But what if the hackers interspersed fake but even more damning or inflammatory emails that were hard to disprove ? What if hackers break in to computers to steal or destroy voter registration information ? What if they disrupted computer-based voting or election returns in important states during the presidential election ? The legitimacy of a presidential election might be called into question , with catastrophic consequences . The DNC hack is just the first wave of possible threats to electoral integrity in the United States -- by foreign intelligence services , and others . <p> How should we respond ? <p> Very hard question to answer at this point . One needs to have a better handle on the facts before even speculating . <p> Advertisement <p> Are there dangerous escalation scenarios that have you worried ? <p> There are always dangerous escalation scenarios in the cyber context because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the unintended second- and third-order consequences of cyberattacks . It 's too hard to even speculate at this point . <p> How high would a problem like this go in the executive branch in terms of deciding what to do going forward ? <p> An allegation that a major adversary has intervened to disrupt the American presidential election is the most serious of issues and will certainly be discussed in the Oval Office and the Situation Room . Whether the allegation of Russian involvement is true or false , it has huge domestic implications and potentially large foreign policy implications ( in Europe , Syria , etc . ) . <p> Advertisement <p> How seriously do you think the government takes issues of cyberwarfare ? Do you feel confident about our defensive capabilities and competence ? <p> " Cyberwar " is a misleading term -- the Russian hack , if it is that , is not an act of war , at least not by traditional standards . It is closer to an intelligence operation with the twist of a damaging publication of the stolen information . That said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its major public and private institutions very seriously . My confidence about our defensive capabilities and competence depends on what institutions you are talking about . Today , some components of the government ( e.g. the Defense Department ) do better than others ( e.g. the Office of Personnel Management , which recently suffered an very damaging hack ) . And private sector defenses , even of important critical infrastructure networks , are a very mixed bag . The scale of the challenge is enormous , and offense has many advantages over defense . I do n't know anyone who is sanguine about our defensive capabilities overall . <p> Top Comment <p> By all means , let 's defend the right of our political parties and candidates to be corrupt and remain undetected . More ... <p> Is the sense that Russia is the only adversary doing things like this ? <p> Nope . In the 2012 election there were reports that China and Anonymous had infiltrated the Obama and Romney campaign networks . The AP reported in May that Director of National Intelligence Clapper warned that " hackers , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already infiltrated candidate networks . Many foreign intelligence services and private entities might have the motive and the means to hack candidate or party committee or vote-tallying computers .
