<p> Demonstrators calling for the legalization of marijuana outside of the White House , in Washington , Saturday , April 2 , 2016 . They are demanding Obama use his authority to stop marijuana arrests and pardon offenders . ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana ) ** FILE ** more &gt; <p> The Drug Enforcement Administration says it plans to decide within the next several months whether to change the federal status of marijuana , according to a letter sent to lawmakers this week . <p> Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug , alongside the likes of LSD and heroin , which means it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use . Rescheduling could make it easier for researchers to study potential uses of the drug , a move that medical marijuana advocates would cheer . <p> The letter to lawmakers , signed by the heads of the DEA , the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of National Drug Control Policy , states that the DEA has received scientific and medical evaluations as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release a determination on rescheduling " in the first half of 2016 . " <p> The letter does not disclose the HHS rescheduling recommendation . <p> Rescheduling of a Schedule I to a Schedule II drug is rare . The DEA has done so just five times , according to a 2015 report by the Brookings Institution . <p> While Schedule II drugs are still classified as having high potential for abuse , they have an accepted medical use in treatment and can be prescribed under tight restrictions . Morphine , oxycodone and cocaine fall into this category . <p> " Reclassifying cannabis will make scientific research easier and will send a strong signal that the U.S. government is finally ready to acknowledge that marijuana has medical value , " said Tom Angell , chairman of the advocacy group the Marijuana Majority . <p> Igor Grant , director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California , San Diego , is one researcher with firsthand experience navigating the bureaucratic hurdles it takes to gain approval for a marijuana study . He says past studies aimed at determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months just to gain approval . <p> Rescheduling marijuana would make it easier to obtain approvals and require a research facility to get federal agencies to sign off on related studies or study modifications less often , Dr. Grant said . <p> " It would make it easier practically , " he said . <p> With the arduous constraints in place , others have opted instead to engage in clinical trials to study effects of cannabinoids , the active compound in marijuana , rather than marijuana itself . <p> Kevin Hill , assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School 's McLean Hospital , is overseeing two studies involving cannabinoids that he said may help determine ways to treat a small percentage of marijuana users who become addicted to the drug . <p> Using cannabinoids that are Schedule II and Schedule III drugs makes it easier to get federal agencies to sign off on the studies . That still does n't address the reality that with marijuana legal for medicinal use in 23 states and the District of Columbia , a lot of people are using marijuana as medicine to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We need to have more of the evidence , " he said . <p> While researchers remain hopeful , others are skeptical that the DEA will reschedule marijuana .
