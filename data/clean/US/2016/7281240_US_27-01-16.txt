<h> Unjust Indictment Ca n't Hide The Realities Of Big Abortion <p> On Monday , a grand jury indicted pro-life investigator David Daleiden and his compatriot Susan Merrill . As the grand jury allowed Planned Parenthood to go scot-free , Daleiden and Merrill face up to 20 years in prison for using a fake ID and for offering to purchase aborted babies ' body parts as part of their undercover work . <p> Pro-life advocates are rightly infuriated by the jury 's decision , as evidenced by a LifeSite petition backing Daleiden that has more than 70,000 signatures in just 40 hours . But as the lawyers gear up for what will likely be a tremendous battle in court , the indictment is a chance to remind the public exactly what the abortion industry is all about . <p> Last summer , Daleiden and his allies exposed how Planned Parenthood profits off of the harvesting of baby parts . Horrifying and illegal as these practices are , they just scratch the surface of what else goes on behind the scenes . Indeed , these practices are not limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting rapists , defrauding taxpayers , and using body parts for beauty products and incinerators . <p> However , according to a comprehensive report from the Alliance Defending Freedom ( ADF ) , these hard-earned public dollars are often misused . ADF 's report identified 105 " limited audits that have found a total of more than $129.7 million in waste , abuse , and potential fraud in federal and state family planning funding programs , the lion 's share of which goes to Planned Parenthood . " <p> ADF Legal Counsel Catherine Foster explained more in an e-mail . " Our report compiles all the known public audits of abortion industry billings , " she explained . " We found that government audits have uncovered hundreds of thousands of unlawfully billed claims related to abortion , and Planned Parenthood has been the source of at least $8.5 million in waste , abuse , and potential fraud . Additionally , a Texas Planned Parenthood affiliate settled fraud claims for $4.3 million . " <p> In November 2014 , Alabama officials discovered a 14-year-old girl had two abortions at a Planned Parenthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clinic had not reported the girl 's condition . In a conversation with a reporter from my outlet , LifeSiteNews , a state official protected Planned Parenthood , saying the violation of state lawwas not done intentionally . That same official asked a LifeSiteNews reporter to put the discovery and the subsequent wrist slapin a positive light . <p> Horrifying practices are not limited to Planned Parenthood , or even the U.S. In early 2014 , Canadian officials admitted they were sending aborted babies to Oregon as a source of energy for incinerators . The babieswere officially qualified as " medical waste . " <p> In the Netherlands and Ukraine , abortion clinics harvested babies at 12 weeks ' gestation for beauty treatments for wealthyBritish andRussian women , respectively . And in 2010 , pro-life groupsraised the alarm about possible medical experimentation with aborted babies at the University of Wisconsin , while in Ukraineprematurely born babies may have been sold for parts . <p> Disturbingly , the worst practice of the abortion industry is n't protection of rapists , or its potential theft of public resources . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bymodern medical science andthe world 's most important religious and philosophicaltext as just as human as you or me . <p> Since its fetal harvesting program was exposed , Planned Parenthood has relied upon misdirection and , now , a legal travesty to hide the abortion industry 's true nature . However , the cat 's out of the bag , folks -- and those who destroy life for profit are on the wrong side of history . <p> John-Henry Westen is the co-founder and Editor-in-Chief of LifeSiteNews , and founder of the Rome Life Forum .
