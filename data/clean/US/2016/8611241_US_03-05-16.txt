Pietrangelo logs heavy ice time in Blues ' playoff run  ST . LOUIS ( AP ) -- Alex Pietrangelo is used to playing a lot -- especially this time of year . The St. Louis Blues linchpin defenseman plays with a high motor and appears to have no issues piling up the ice time .  Pietrangelo is fourth overall in the playoffs averaging 30 minutes , 34 seconds , including more than 35 minutes in the Blues ' overtime victory in Game 2 in Dallas on Sunday . Among the surviving eight teams , he 's at the top of the list .  " The more you play him , the better he plays , " coach Ken Hitchcock said Monday , a day ahead of Game 3 against the Stars ( 9:30 p.m . ET , NBCSN ) in a series knotted at a game apiece . " I think he keeps his focus razor-sharp , and when he 's like that , he 's going to help us . "  " He is go , go , go and guys sometimes " Backes said . " He 's a big reason why we 're still playing . "  Pietrangelo leads the rush at times and has a goal and five assists in the playoffs for a team savoring its first victory in the second round since 2002 .  Several teammates believe Pietrangelo , the fourth overall pick in 2008 , was the Blues ' MVP in the first round . He was instrumental in holding down Blackhawks stars Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews .  " I like having the opportunity to play on a big stage , " Pietrangelo said . " Sometimes it 's hard minutes , but I 'll take that as long as it 's going to help us . "  All of the minutes leaders still in the playoffs are defensemen , with Pittsburgh 's Kris Letang right behind Pietrangelo at 29:24 per game . The Islanders have two players getting heavy rotation , Nick Leddy ( 28:33 ) and Travis Hamonic ( 27:03 ) . Nashville 's Roman Josi ( 27:22 ) and Tampa Bay 's Victor Hedman ( 27:02 ) also are out even more given he 's not on the first power play unit , duty that 's not usually as taxing as regular shifts .  " You have to recognize that those are heavy minutes he 's playing , " coach Ken Hitchcock said . " He 's getting challenged , he 's playing against top players , he 's killing all the penalties . "  The odds of Pietrangelo getting more extremely heavy duty would seem to be high , given the Stars and Blues have met seven times with four going to overtime and one decided in a shootout . He can be a calming influence , although inside he 's going 100 mph .  " I 'm still amped up , you can ask my teammates , " Pietrangelo said . " I 'm always on the go . "  Dallas has a bit of goalie intrigue . Coach Lindy Ruff yanked Kari Lehtonen after the Blues ' three-goal first period in Game 2 , and Antti Niemi finished strong , stopping 19 consecutive shots before Backes got the winner in overtime .  San Jose figures to be in prime position in Nashville . The Sharks led the NHL with 28 road wins and swept all three in Los Angeles in the first round , giving the team plenty of confidence .  " It 's good knowing that we have that , but that does n't guarantee anything , " said captain Joe Pavelski , who had the tiebreaking goal in a 3-2 victory in Game 2 . " We understand this series is only to get tougher . "  The Predators have come up empty thus far , but controlled play much of Game 2 .  " We should be encouraged by the way we played , " defenseman Mattias Ekholm said . " Bottom line , we just need to score a few more goals . You are n't going to win scoring one goal or two goals . "  The Predators also must do a better job avoiding penalties and killing them when they do happen . San Jose is 3 for 5 on the power play , including the first goal in Game 2 capitalizing on  " We have to stay out of the box , " Josi said . " They are so dangerous on the power play . "   Lightning at Islanders , series tied 1-1 , 7 p.m . EDT , NBCSN  The Islanders realize they 'll need a better effort coming home after dropping Game 2 4-1 . The Lightning have outscored them 6-2 the last four periods .  " We 've just got to make it a little harder and slow them , " captain John Tavares said . " They 're obviously a quick team , make plays , skate well . We got to get a little bit more aggressive and hungry on the forecheck . "  The Lightning limited the Islanders to just eight shots the last two periods in Game 2 after dropping the series opener 5-3 .  Tyler Johnson had two goals in Game 2 for the Lightning . They can also lean on a strong penalty-kill , which has allowed two goals in nine chances in this series , and just three in 34 overall in this postseason . . " Just focus on our game and do what we can do and just play like we did ( in Game 2 ) . "  The Islanders faced a similar scenario in the first round against Florida , splitting the first two games on the road . New York won three of four to close out that series in six games .  " They 're playing pretty aggressive , but I think mostly it 's just us looking ourselves in the mirror and just being better , " Tavares said .
