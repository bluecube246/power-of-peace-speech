the inside story of why the wnba draft picks did the same fist bump at the draft  uncasville , conn. -- after being announced as the top wnba draft pick , former uconn star breanna stewart strode to the stage . she hugged her parents , her former teammates who in a few minutes would go second and third in the draft . she hugged uconn coach geno auriemma .  finally , she arrived at the stage to greet wnba president lisa borders . instead of the familiar awkward hug or handshake that often accompanies wnba drafts , the two went in for a fist bump and then flashed three fingers in the air to form a ' w ' .  " so we 're giving each other a pound and then showing three fingers . this is actually a w , " borders explained later , with her fingers in the air in a w shape . " it 's for the wnba and in sign language this is actually a w. so w for women and w for the wnba . " our 20th season , " borders said . " we want to celebrate in so many different ways ... we thought we have to have some way to great one another on a regular basis for the w for the 20th and beyond and this is what we came up with . "  borders , a former coca-cola executive who is in her first season with the league , introduced the fist bump to the potential draft picks at pre-draft orientation .  former south carolina player tiffany mitchell , who was selected as the ninth pick at the draft , said there was a bit of pressure to get the fist bump right -- especially with all of the emotion surrounding the night . the players practiced the fist bump a bit with each other and it served instantly almost as an inside joke between them .  " we 'd go up to each other and it would be like ' pound ' and just throw it up , " mitchell said . " it was just cool , just to have something different from everyone else . league in february , borders has put an emphasis on highlighting the league 's 20th anniversary in as many small but marketable ways as possible . the league is changing its color scheme on some of its uniforms for the upcoming season , there 's a new 20th anniversary logo and a new ad campaign called ' watch me work ' .  a specialized fist bump for the class is likely not just a way to avoid awkward hugs -- borders saw it as just another way to make the upcoming season stand out .  it was also an early chance for some of the prospects to take a leadership role in their draft class .  " today when we were getting makeup and hair i was going around to everybody just doing it and no one remembered , " said rachel banham , who was selected fourth in the draft .
