Think you know the full story of 'Sully'? Clint Eastwood says you don't.

A skilled director can make a tense story come to life onscreen . But an unusually good director can make us feel anxious while watching a story we expected to have no drama at all , and Clint Eastwood does that in the low-key , beautifully assembled " Sully . "  U.S. Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger , now known to the country as Sully , was flying an Airbus from LaGuardia to Charlotte in January 2009 . A flock of geese blasted toward the plane , disabling two engines , and he landed on the Hudson River , getting all 155 people aboard home alive .  Warner Bros. bills this biopic as " The untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson , " but they use the wrong preposition . It 's the untold story after the event , when the National Transportation Safety Board questioned Sullenberger 's judgment and threatened to retire him without a pension if the crash could have been averted .  Or so it goes in Todd Komarnicki 's script . He adapted " Highest Duty , " the so he takes an unadulteratedly favorable view of the protagonist . Though Sully second-guesses his decision once in a while and has bad dreams , someone -- a bartender , his co-pilot ( Aaron Eckhart ) , even his wife ( Laura Linney ) -- is always on hand to remind him he 's a hero .  This may sound corny , yet it 's not . Eastwood tells the story cleverly and efficiently ; he weaves in and out of the trial , changing points of view constantly . He first gives us the crash from the air traffic controllers ' side and then , much later , from the cockpit .  Hanks maintains a calm demeanor that conceals a racing pulse and troubled mind . We have seen him do this cool-under-fire thing many times , from " Saving Private Ryan " to " Captain Phillips , " yet he varies these characters subtly . ( Folks with long memories will recall that he played another Sully 14 years ago : The hit man in " Road to Perdition . " )  Eastwood promoted his longtime Murray cut crash sequences that make you wonder how the film crew pulled them off . Cinematographer Tom Stern , who has shot Eastwood 's last 13 features , knows what the boss wants : A subtle color palette that distinguishes between the institutional glare of examination rooms and the pale skies of a January day over New York .  Despite its brief running time , the film feels stretched out once or twice , especially when Sully phones his wife . We never see them together ; she 's there to remind us what 's at stake if the NTSB finds him culpable , and the character becomes disposable .  On the other hand , the coda that shows the real Chesley and Lorraine Sullenberger visiting the Carolinas Aviation Museum belongs in the picture . It shows us both how closely Hanks impersonated him in looks and demeanor and reminds us what an ordinary guy Sully was , except for that extraordinary four minutes of cool-headed valor .  Charlotteans may recognize actor Rob Trevelier as a control tower supervisor , and I heard audience members chuckle when Frisco 's Double Eagle Steak House on Piedmont Row .  The real Charlotte-bound passengers show up in the reunion at the Aviation Museum , and almost all have Southern accents -- though nobody on the fictional plane does . Maybe the Californians making this picture did n't notice .
