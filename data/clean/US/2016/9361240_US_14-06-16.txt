by now we all know the story of nick u'ren , the warriors lackey who , during last year 's finals , famously suggested to the team 's coaching staff that they start andre iguodala for the first time all season . it was a feel-good anecdote to take away from a finals that at times bordered on nihilistic -- a perfect bow on top of a magical , fairytale season .  but perhaps more importantly , the story of u'ren 's helped foster the idea that the warriors as a franchise were just different from the rest of the nba . this thesis would later be spelled out by team co-owner joe lacob in a new york times magazine cover story in which he said his organization was " light-years ahead " of the rest of the league .  steve kerr was probably just being a good boss when he dropped u'ren 's name in a press conference after golden state flipped the series with a win in game 4 , but the residual effect of the u'ren story becoming public was a deepening warriors ' owner , general manager , coach , and players smarter than yours , but their ballboy is , too . and like every great silicon valley companies , the franchise is a meritocracy , where the best ideas float to the top , no matter where they originated .  advertisement  it did n't really matter that what u'ren proposed was far from radical . as he explained to tim kawakami recently , the warriors had used their now-vaunted death lineup during the 2014-2015 regular season , and had observed its prowess . u'ren merely suggested that they begin the game with it . anyway , it might not have mattered had draymond green and stephen curry not unclenched their sphincters , or had david lee not risen from the crypt , or had andre igoudala not made a long succession of jumpers he often misses , or had lebron james -- many months before the creation of the mr. krabs meme -- not suddenly found himself throwing court-warping passes to james jones and mike miller .  rarely does one key unlock a championship . the warriors a cute story . then , this season , the death lineup started ravaging the league , turning the warriors into a traveling circus poised to break an unbreakable record and , well , you can probably understand why they started getting high on their own supply .  sponsored  this brings us , unexpectedly , to james michael mcadoo . mcadoo was a five-star recruit out of high school with impeccable genes . he chose to attend unc , where he was kind of a bust . he went undrafted , but the warriors liked him just enough to shuttle him between their d-league team in santa cruz and the end of the bench in oakland . he picked up some garbage time scraps , averaging six-and-a-half minutes played across 41 games , shooting roughly twice per game . he was about as important to the warriors ' historic season as the hot dog vendor .  and then , all of a sudden , after being left inactive for much of the playoffs , mcadoo was jogging onto the floor in this year 's thrillingly well-played game 4 cavs before inevitably clinching their second straight championship at home in a game that would be a mere coronation for a budding dynasty that could go down as one of the nba 's greatest . mcadoo made a few good plays , scoring at the rim once and dishing to shaun livingston for a layup . curry , klay thompson , and harrison barnes rained down threes , iguodala played cephalopodic defense , and that was that .  but what mcadoo did on the court was less important than the fact that kerr unsheathed him in the first place -- a magician unveiling his boldest trick yet . you could feel the reverence for the warriors ' sorcery when , through some sort of clerical error or trickery , mcadoo was initially announced as the replacement for the suspended green in the game 5 starting lineup . the warriors were set to make the cavs disappear on live tv once again , and this time the degree of difficulty was going to blow your mind .  alas , you know what happened . with draymond watching the game from lineup , and the warriors got carved up by lebron james and kyrie irving , both of whom had unusually hot jumpers but also encountered little resistance at the basket . mcadoo played eight minutes , picking up two rebounds and three fouls . he did n't shoot once . he was what we thought he was : an athletic but green big man who can shuffle his feet but who ca n't really shoot or score or protect the rim . in his eight minutes on the court , the warriors were outscored by 10 points .  advertisement  it 's fine for james michael mcadoo to be useless . he 's 23 and has barely played in the nba . but that he carried the implication of being this year 's sequel to last year 's checkmate -- ? for even just a moment -- means that we , just like joe lacob himself , have the warriors fucked up . they are not wizards . they can not see into the future . they are ? reaching desperately ? to plug leaks , like every team must incredible basketball players , but james michael mcadoo is n't one of them . he is n't saving anyone from anything .
