The Gawker Endorsement: None of Them

for the first time in the modern primary era , the new york presidential primary election , happening today , is actually important in the races for both the republican and democratic nominations . for the conscientious citizen , this is lousy news . you can no longer engage in the beloved new york tradition of just writing in howard stern , confident that your vote would n't have mattered anyway .  we are sensitive to the terrible burden this places on our readers , and so we have decided to undertake the rare of step of issuing endorsements in both the republican and democratic primaries . while our writers are free to support candidates of their choosing , gawker , which is based in new york , has historically been reluctant to officially endorse particular candidates in local or national elections . ( though we have not avoided endorsements entirely . )  chances are good that you ca n't vote anyway , because you were self-righteous ( or ill-informed ) enough to register as an independent , or as a member of the working register as a democrat or republican , your vote today matters . please consider our plea to not exercise this terrible power .  advertisement  do n't vote for donald trump  yeah , this one 's a no-brainer , right ?  though you 'd be surprised ! there are , theoretically , reasons a thinking person might vote for donald trump . trump is actively sabotaging the republican party and breaking the conservative movement 's hold on it , two very laudable goals . he is , counterintuitively , the least-conservative republican in the race , and the most likely to govern as something resembling a moderate . because he is beholden to none of the traditional ideological stakeholders in the republican party , trump might even be uniquely suited to break the hold the most reactionary elements have over the gop .  sponsored  but , you know , there 's also the xenophobic ethnonationalism bordering on support for ethnic cleansing , the shameless embrace of political violence , the unmistakable parallels to the rise of the new european crypto-fascist right , the grotesque sexism , sausage fingers on the button the survivors of his presidency would end up living in the road .  you should n't vote for donald trump . but you knew that already .  do n't vote for ted cruz  again , it may seem like a no-brainer .  there is no good outcome to a trump versus cruz fight . trump is a rabble-rousing racist white populist with no core principles . cruz is a true-believing extremist . trump would probably be a horrible president . cruz would definitely be a horrible president . he 's a right-wing zealot , an evangelical fanatic , and an agent of plutocracy . the scariest thing about ted cruz is that he 's apparently smart enough to become hugely successful despite lacking any ability to win allies or even friends . if he was even slightly personable he 'd be unstoppable .  advertisement  however , even a conservative -- a rabid conservative -- should n't vote for cruz . he 'd be the most conservative candidate since barry goldwater , and , barring an extremely unlikely democratic collapse , 's defeat marked the beginning of the long ascendance of the conservative movement , cruz 's defeat would look much more like its closing bookend . he would discredit movement conservatism for a generation , and the " moderate " business interests of the party would immediately work to seize control of the gop from both the insurgent ideologues and the rowdy populists . ( this is also sort of the reason to hope that conservatives do vote for cruz . )  do n't vote for john kasich  this is less of an issue in new york , thanks to our closed primaries , but every ostensible democrat or liberal who casts a vote for kasich because they feel some responsibility to help " stop trump " is doing nothing but making it a bit more likely that our next president will be a very conservative republican .  the idiotic supporters of marco rubio liked to claim that " the media " and liberals enjoyed watching rubio fail because they were scared of him . nope . we liked watching marco rubio fail because it was very funny as i 'm speaking both for the left and the press , i 'll be totally honest : kasich has always been the most plausibly electable candidate in the entire gop field , and i 'm pretty sure he 'd beat hillary clinton . hell , i think romney should have picked him as his running mate in 2012 . the worst-case scenario for democrats is that kasich emerges from a contested convention with the nomination .  president kasich would be george w. bush 's third term , only with a large ( and significantly more conservative ) republican congressional majority baked in . can you even imagine how much damage he and paul ryan could do in one term ? just about every upwardly redistributive policy the american enterprise institute can think of would be jammed through before liberals had time to catch their breath .  just about the best thing we can hope for with kasich is that his rote hawkishness is completely insincere , because otherwise we 'll get sequels both to the bush tax cuts and the iraq war .  do n't vote for disaster . it will be a disaster mainly because our entire political system is a disaster .  this is not particular to her . clinton 's first term would be , in large part , a continuation of the obama presidency , featuring similar domestic priorities , appointees , nominees , and arguments . it would also be a continuation of the democratic party 's odd semi-decline , which has seen it effectively become a party that is capable only of winning the presidency and , in extraordinarily good years , tenuous control of the senate . if clinton represents the democratic party establishment , it 's an establishment that is guilty of electoral malpractice on a grand scale . the party is totally unprepared to capitalize on the fact that the republican presidential nominee is likely to be among the least-liked in modern history : as david dayen pointed out in the new republic last month , there will be at least 27 congressional races this november in which no democrats will appear on the ballots at all ; two of those races are for seats democrats held prior specifically clinton 's fault , of course , but neither will it be specifically her fault when the feebleness of the democratic party and the general brokenness of our entire presidential system causes her first term to be a depressing continuation of the alienating gridlock that has characterized the tea party era . whatever gains the democrats make in 2016 will likely be wiped out in 2018 . assuming republicans maintain statehouse control nationwide -- a safe enough assumption , considering the fecklessness of the democratic party -- the 2020 census will lock in a republican house for another decade .  this is why praise for clinton 's " realism " is so misguided . want to talk about what 's realistic ? even the most modest center-left agenda imaginable stands no hope of being enacted legislatively no matter who the next president is . clinton , for all that her supporters talk of her ability to get things done within the system , will have no magical ability to work with a republican congress on anything substantive . if they do find common ground , watch out : when with republicans in congress , those compromises have involved the clintons supporting conservative policy -- from welfare reform to then-senator clinton 's odd 2005 decision to co-sponsor a bill that would make flag-burning illegal .  that incident is actually a fine example of how clinton 's reactionary political instincts have been out-of-date for more than a decade . the flag-burning bill was supposed to be a " compromise " from the conservative priority of a flag-burning constitutional amendment , which republicans introduced in every congress following the 1994 " republican revolution . " they have n't introduced it again since 2006 , because even by then it was clearly no longer a wedge issue voters actually cared about .  even if penn , sydney blumenthal , and lanny davis are too toxic to return to a clinton white house in major official capacities , there 's little reason to believe that clinton wo n't just fill her administration with spiritual successors to those craven loyalists . ( this even before we get to the likely return of economic advisers and appointees in the rubin/summers mold , or maybe even to foreign policy , an area in which there is actual daylight between clinton and the man she hopes to replace . barack obama seems more skeptical of america 's ability to improve the world through hegemonic displays of force than any president since world war ii . even that skepticism did n't stop him from from regularly intervening across the world , with very little to show for it but a large death toll and yet more " instability . "  clinton does not share obama 's skepticism , at all . she 's always been naturally hawkish , and when the democratic debates touch on foreign policy , she tends to sound like she 'd be right at home on stage with kasich and cruz . her serene self-confidence in her demonstrably poor judgment on matters of war and peace is her most troubling quality .  do n't vote for bernie sanders  there are plenty of perfectly legitimate political reasons for a left-leaning voter not to support sanders , of course . he has his unliberal gun record , he voted for the same crime bill 's dabbled in anti-immigration rhetoric in the recent past . as president , he may outsource his defense policy-making to the same sorts of " liberal interventionists " who have kept us in constant war even after we elected a president whose popularity was due in part to his opposition to the iraq invasion . perhaps his policies , if actually instituted , would actually lead to a tax revolt or mass middle class backlash .  there 's also the fact bernie sanders will probably not win the democratic nomination , barring a completely unforeseeable development -- clinton decides she 's sick of this shit and drops out of the race , basically .  still , if you find that you are closer to sanders than to clinton on most of the issues on which they differ , then by all means vote for him . there 's always a shot , no matter how unlikely it currently seems . but that unlikely bernie sanders victory could still end up turning out horribly even for people inclined to support him .  first of all , if sanders were the democratic party establishment would respond with fury . they 'd purge leftists , rig the nominating process even further , and do everything they could to eliminate any trace of economic populism from the party 's platform . the next nominee would probably be young , probably a person of color , and -- most importantly -- they would be deeply allied with the investor class wing of the party . ( cory booker , in other words , or someone very much like him . ) just as mcgovern 's landslide loss led directly to the dlc and the third way , so would a sanders loss lead to the further gentrification of the democratic party .  if sanders did win it all ? it could still end up being an unmitigated disaster for the american left , because making him a failed president would be the top priority of the entire american monied elite .  not to exaggerate sanders ' radicalism , but the phenomenon of his campaign can be understood as a popular revolt against the dominant ideology of our era , which is ( has a lot of contested meanings , and is too often simply leftist shorthand for " stuff i do n't like , " but it 's still a useful umbrella term for what the marxist economist chris dillow recently described -- accurately , i think -- as " not so much a coherent intellectual project as a series of opportunistic ad hoc uses of capitalist power . "  power is the operative word there : the rentiers have pretty much all of it , and they are willing to exercise it to protect their interests .  when the left-wing , anti-austerity syriza party took power in greece , that nation 's creditors -- the european commission , european central bank , and the international monetary fund -- effectively blackmailed the entire country into accepting austerity , exercising veto power over democracy itself . a hypothetical sanders presidency probably would n't face a quashing quite that brutal -- or blatant -- but greece shows how few compunctions the investor class has about undermining democracy to ensure the success of its preferred economic arrangements .  sanders would be an ineffective but because the system itself would rebel against him . he would n't just face an intransigent republican-controlled congress , he 'd likely also face an open revolt by the business class element of the democratic party -- the element that has totally dominated the party since the decline of big labor . if president sanders tried anything truly radical , he could expect to see skittish " centrist " democratic senators joining republicans in blocking his appointees , the supreme court blocking his executive actions , and perhaps even the federal reserve working to undermine his economic policy . the worst-case scenario ? impeachment , and the foreclosing of any hope of the left building on his presidency to establish true social democracy in america . there 's no reason to believe that sanders ' " political revolution , " a naive belief in mass electoral action to fix structural problems baked into our political system , would be able to overcome the unprecedented opposition that would arise in response to any attempt to enact his agenda .  all of that assumes president sanders actually would make good on course . there 's also the chance that he 'd just be a mostly conventional democratic president . if that 's true , what 's worth getting so excited about , exactly ?  it would be better , surely , for the left to build on what sanders accomplishes in defeat , and seriously plot a systematic takeover of the democratic party , rather than pin the movement 's hopes on one presidential candidate . fixating on the presidency might be a waste of activist energy and donor funds , when there are andrew cuomos and rahm emanuels out there who need defeating first .
