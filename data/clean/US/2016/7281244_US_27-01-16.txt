( Ross D. Franklin The Associated Press ) Willie Jessop , a former spokesperson and head of security of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints before leaving the sect in 2011 , leaves the Sandra Day O'Connor United States District Court after a day of testifying during a federal civil rights trial against two polygamous towns on the Arizona-Utah line on Tuesday in Phoenix .  Charlene Wall Jeffs ? Former wife of Lyle Jeffs , the man now running FLDS operations , says lying to the government is OK as long as it 's " a white lie . "  " Being in said Charlene Wall Jeffs , as she introduced herself to a Phoenix courtroom from the witness stand Wednesday .  She has since divorced Lyle Jeffs , the man running the day-to-day operations of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints .  The U.S. Justice Department called Charlene Jeffs as a witness in its discrimination lawsuit against the towns of Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Ariz. , collectively known as Short Creek . The Justice Department alleges the two municipal governments collude with the church to discriminate against people who are not FLDS .  While a few wives have testified in proceedings against the FLDS through the years -- including two of Charlene Jeffs ' half-sisters -- Charlene Jeffs may be the first who was legally married to someone so high in the FLDS hierarchy . Lyle Jeffs is believed to have eight other spiritual wives .  Charlene Jeffs , 50 , told the jury that her parents joined the FLDS when she was 2 years old and that she grew up in the Salt Lake Valley .  " It was the FLDS . " It was all about family , about love . "  FLDS members were taught that if the government apprehended them , they should agree with their captor until their release , she said . Then they could resume how they were living before .  Justice Department attorney Sean Keveney asked her whether that mean it was OK to lie to the government .  Her marriage at age 18 to Lyle Jeffs was arranged . The couple went on to have 10 children . They lived in the Salt Lake Valley until 2001 , when the faithful were ordered by her father-in-law , then-FLDS President Rulon Jeffs , to move to Short Creek . Rulon Jeffs and his son Warren told the people that the 2002 Winter Olympics would bring about a rapture in the Salt Lake Valley .  Rulon Jeffs died in 2002 , and Warren Jeffs ascended to FLDS prophet . That is when things began to change , Charlene Jeffs testified . Warren Jeffs eventually banned sex between spouses and said men and women should be separated .  When Warren helped account for money the faithful were donating to him and the church . She would enter the offerings into a spreadsheet program .  The offerings she recorded included those from Hildale and Colorado City marshals and from town officials , she testified . She said she also saw cash being inspected for sequential serial numbers .  Such bills were put aside , and Lyle Jeffs would take them to a casino , buy chips , remain there an hour and then cash out , Charlene Jeffs testified .  In 2010 , Warren Jeffs , from jail cells in Texas , created the United Order , an elite subset of the FLDS . People in the United Order had to take an oath to not discuss it and could not live or speak with people who did n't qualify .  Charlene Jeffs said she was exiled in 2012 , though she did n't say why . She was sent to live alone in a trailer in Short Creek .
