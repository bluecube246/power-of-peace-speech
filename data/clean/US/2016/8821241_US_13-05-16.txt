( kutv ) just days after uta announced it would close its committee meetings to the public as part of an effort to overhaul the transit authority and create more transparency , its board chairman is striking a much different tone .  " you really want to know the truth ? because you screw us up , " burton told a tribune reporter friday , according to the newspaper , in response to a question about why committee meetings will no longer be open .  burton went on to criticize how the newspaper has reported past committee meetings , the tribune reported , and said it is " intolerable " that many of uta 's board members learn about issues from the tribune instead of uta itself since they do not always attend every committee meeting .  interim uta president and ceo jerry benson also accused the tribune of making up facts in their stories , the newspaper reported .  burton was unavailable for comment friday , but benson did make himself available .  " i think he expressed some of the benson said , adding he agrees with burton 's sentiment . " occasionally , when the media reports something that is part of an informal discussion before the rest of the board has a chance to see it , that screws up the process of the board . "  terry orme , editor of the salt lake tribune , said he finds that " troubling . "  orme defended his paper 's coverage and said since uta receives public money , it 's subject to scrutiny .  the move to close committee meetings has sparked public outcry . uta officials told 2news earlier this week that while committee meetings will be closed , board meetings will still be open on a monthly basis .  " this is actually a board reform , " uta spokesman remi barron told 2news in an interview wednesday . " what we decided to do was to remove all of the functions from the committee meetings and put those with the full board . "  committees made up of smaller groups of board members have typically discussed issues and made formal could lead to back-door deals made at closed-door committee meetings .  but benson , the interim ceo , insists the change will make things better .  " we hope to have an opportunity to demonstrate that this will in fact improve public access to uta and improve our transparency , " benson said .
