2nd person dies in wake of Wis. flooding  VICTORY , Wis. - A second person has died in the storms and flooding that swamped parts of western Wisconsin .  The Vernon County Sheriff 's Office says a 79-year-old rural Viroqua man attempted to drive through flood water on a road near his home Thursday .  Authorities say Joseph Menne was in a pickup truck pulling a trailer which got stuck in six feet of water . The flood water eventually filled the pickup compartment . Menne was reported missing about 7 p.m . His body was found about two hours later .  The torrential rain and flooding also killed 53-year-old Michael McDonald in the same western Wisconsin county Thursday when his home slid down the side of a bluff and onto a highway .  The flooding and mudslides heavily damaged the small community where McDonald lived near the base of a bluff along the Mississippi River .
