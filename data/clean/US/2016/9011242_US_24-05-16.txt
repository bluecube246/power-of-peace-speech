as the copyright infringement lawsuit between spirit and led zeppelin gets closer to its trial date , the defendants continue to fight back . today ( may 24 ) , lawyers for led zeppelin suggested that spirit are " playing to the press " and " tainting the jury pool . "  the hollywood reporter quotes a brief filed that reads , " plaintiff 's motion is a pr stunt in the hope of tainting the jury pool . despite being told that jimmy page , robert plant and john paul jones fully intend to appear at the trial , plaintiff 's counsel misrepresented to the court at the april 25 , 2016 pretrial conference that messrs . page , plant and jones ' are refusing to appear in this court in the claims against them , ' and plaintiff 's counsel repeated that misrepresentation to news cameras on the courthouse steps , causing a flurry of press reports repeating plaintiff 's false accusation . when those reports died down , plaintiff triggered renewed reports of his misrepresentation by now filing a belated motion that is playing to the press . "  although a u.s. district judge 's ruling last month removed the last hurdle for the case to go to trial , led zeppelin 's lawyers once again voiced their opposition to the case , adding , " there simply is no merit to plaintiff 's attempt to pursue a 45-year-old claim that the actual copyright owner and randy wolfe never bothered to file . "  the estate of randy wolfe , whose stage name was randy california , and former spirit bassist mark andes are suing led zeppelin on the grounds that the introduction to " stairway to heaven " is very similar to their song , " taurus , " that appeared on spirit 's 1968 debut . led zeppelin 's first u.s. concert was as spirit 's opening act . the plaintiff 's lawyers have said that they would be willing to settle the case for $1 and a share of the songwriting royalties . the trial is expected to begin june 14 .  welcome back to ultimate classic rock  it appears that you already have an account created your personal information safe , we need to verify that it 's really you . to activate your account , please confirm your password . when you have confirmed your password , you will be able to log in through facebook on both sites .  welcome back to ultimate classic rock  it appears that you already have an account on this site associated with . to connect your existing account just click on the account activation button below . you will maintain your existing vip profile . after you do this , you will be able to always log in to http : **25;1743;toolong using your original account information .
