<p> In the late ' 90s , singer Faith Evans asked Sean " Puffy " Combs , the head of her label , Bad Boy Records , if she could tour with a live band . A true singer 's singer , Faith had grown up performing with musicians in church and in the studio . She 'd attended concerts where the artists had a full live band and she wanted to bring that feel to her shows . Combs shut her down . There was no way . Touring with a band was too expensive -- and with technology , it was just completely unnecessary . With the touch of a button , the sounds of a live band could be anywhere . <p> One of the greatest things about hip-hop music and culture is that it leveled the playing field and allowed young people to express themselves without the burden and expense of instrumentation . Instead of having a live band -- we learned to sample those very bands and produce music with soul without having to deal with the cost . But that benefit we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral part of Black music . <p> The concept of an actual band has slowly eroded over the years , as the cost of making music has dropped . Platinum-selling artists can record entire albums in complete solitude . Today , those who make music never have to actually learn how to plan an instrument . That 's not necessarily a bad thing . But it definitely changes the face of music , particular in R&amp;B and soul music , which has its roots in musical bands . <p> And so , the recent death of Earth Wind &amp; Fire founder Maurice White is more than just a loss for the group -- it 's an extreme loss for live bands and instrumentation as whole . <p> The Gap Band , Kool and The Gang , Maze featuring Frankie Beverly -- live instrumentation has always been part of the best of Black music . But by the 1990s , the concept , ( with a few exceptions , including Tony Toni Ton ? ) , was fading away . <p> Of course , these artists still live on in music created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tracks hip-hop tracks that sample older songs , Earth Wind &amp; Fire has been sampled a whopping 434 times . It 's proof positive that even if the music is n't being created from scratch , it 's still being validated and appreciated . <p> Interestingly , one of the most sampled tracks from Earth Wind &amp; Fire is also one of their most musically intricate and complex . <p> Brazilian Rhyme , ( Beijo Interlude ) was borrowed over fifty times by a broad sample of hip-hop artists over the years , from Eazy E , Big Pun and Mary J. Blige to A Tribe Called Quest , The Fugees and Joe Budden . <p> It 's a beautiful thing that Earth , Wind &amp; Fire 's music will still be a force that lives on -- both in their music and that of the hip-hop generation that used it to create their own sound . <p> However , the death of Maurice White also serves to remind us that the era of live instrumentation remains ever closer to also resting in peace .
