<h> posted at 11:01 am on September 13 , 2016 by Ed Morrissey <p> When Ivanka Trump pushed for more government regulation on businesses for family leave at the Republican convention , some wondered whether Donald Trump took it seriously . The answer , according to the Washington Post 's Robert Costa , is apparently yes . Trump will propose six paid weeks of maternity leave , along with child-care tax credits aimed at families earning $500,000 a year or less : <p> A campaign memo shared early Tuesday with The Washington Post shows that Trump 's plan " will rewrite the tax code to allow working parents to deduct from their income taxes child-care expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents . " <p> That deduction would be capped at the " average cost of care " in the state of residence , and it would not be available to individuals earning more than $250,000 or a couple earning more than $500,000 . ... <p> Another policy proposal will be guaranteeing " six weeks of paid maternity leave " through an amendment of current unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give twelve weeks of unpaid maternity leave , allowing new mothers to return to the same position ( or one of similar rank and equal pay ) . That creates a burden on employers already to fill positions temporarily , and the costs are not a wash . If employers have to pay six weeks of salary on top of that , the costs will be enormous . <p> Costa 's description of this proposal sounds like it wo n't be a mandate on employers , at least not directly . Trump may propose to pay benefits through the unemployment insurance system , even though the mothers will still be employed . All that does is shuffle the costs around , because employers already pay unemployment insurance tax on every employee to both the state and federal governments in order to fund unemployment payments . Adding maternity to the conditions that trigger payment will force those taxes upward , and probably sharply . <p> Let 's do the math . In 2014 , the latest period for which the CDC has birth data , the US had 3,988,076 births -- 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using the current labor force participation rate for women ( 56.8% ) , we can estimate that women who are employed had roughly 2.27 million of these births but that figure may really be higher than that , especially given the high percentage of births outside of marriage . The average per-capita income in the US is $28,555 ( 2014 figures , Census Bureau ) , which would amount to $549 per week , or about $3300 for six weeks . The cost of this program would be another $7.5 billion in payouts from the unemployment system each year , on top of the payments already being made for actual unemployment . <p> Now consider the current status of budgets , not just at the federal level but also in each of the states . Almost every state has a looming pension crisis , and the federal budget operates on 40% borrowed money -- on top of having an entitlement-program crisis looming . The system does not have room for another entitlement program , and businesses are already struggling with costs . This program would have to burden employers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to hurt smaller businesses more because of the realities of the economies of scale . It will be yet another reason for businesses to refrain from hiring as a way to limit their exposure to higher taxes , along with the other employer mandate that came from ObamaCare . <p> When Ivanka highlighted the " wage gap " in her speech at the Republican convention , I warned this might be coming : <p> What made this stand out even more was that it was the only issue in which Ivanka went into detail . The other political points raised in her introduction were at the level of my father will fight for you on this . Ivanka spent three of the 22 paragraphs of her speech on this point alone . Clearly , Team Trump understands that they have a steep gender gap to bridge in the general election , and they may have wanted to pre-empt ( or " triangulate " ) the issue ahead of next week 's Democratic convention , when Hillary Clinton will ride it hard . To conservatives who already worry about Trump 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kind of government intervention in marketplace decisions that they usually fight Democrats to stop rather than Republicans . <p> This is more than triangulation -- it 's a surrender on the principle of limited government . The tax credits may or may not be wisely configured , but guaranteeing pay will require precisely the government intervention at which Ivanka 's speech hinted . We 're still giving away fantasy money , spending cash that even our grandchildren 's grandchildren have n't yet earned , and now Republicans want to indulge that same Democratic fantasy .
