Six weeks ago , they were a Dallas novelty : the first rookie quarterback-running back combo to start the season for the Cowboys since Roger Staubach and Calvin Hill nearly 50 years ago . Now they are the future of the Dallas offense . ( AP Photo/LM Otero , File ) <p> FRISCO <p> NEXT GAME <p> Eagles at Cowboys , 7:30 p.m . Oct. 30 , NBC <p> Ezekiel Elliott had star potential the moment he was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys , a high pick at running back with the benefit of perhaps the NFL 's best offensive line . <p> Dak Prescott figured to be in charge of the scout team as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , they have transformed from a Dallas novelty -- the first rookie quarterback-running back combo to start the season for the Cowboys since Roger Staubach and Calvin Hill almost 50 years ago -- into a pair of record-setters . <p> They also took the Cowboys ( 5-1 ) into the bye week on a five-game winning streak despite missing 10-year starting quarterback Tony Romo the whole time and star receiver Dez Bryant for half of it . <p> " I do n't really look back too much other than the record , " said Prescott , who became the starter after backup Kellen Moore broke an ankle in training camp and Romo broke a bone in his back during a preseason game . <p> Oh , and Prescott was n't talking about Tom Brady 's record , the one he topped by throwing 176 passes without an interception to start his career . New England 's four-time Super Bowl winner had the previous mark at 162 attempts . <p> " I like what the record says right now , " the 23-year-old said . " I like where we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around this locker room and how we interact with each other and having fun . That 's what 's important to me . " <p> Regardless of the drama over who should start once Romo comes back from his fourth back injury in less than four years , Dallas figures to have found life after the 36-year-old with a growing history of injuries . <p> " I think we 're off to a good start , " said quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson , who spent more time with Prescott than anyone else on the staff before Dallas took him in the fourth round . " He 's certainly impressed . There 's a lot of football left to be played . I think that he 's shown that he can handle it , on the field , off the field , and nothing 's too big for him . " <p> That 's another theme with these rookies -- their pedigree . Prescott is the winningest quarterback in Mississippi State history and shares the distinction with Tim Tebow as the only SEC quarterbacks with at least 70 touchdowns passing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusher at Ohio State , and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones watched him score four touchdowns on Dallas ' home field when the Buckeyes won the national championship in the 2014 season . Elliott entered the bye week leading the NFL with 703 yards rushing , and the fourth overall pick in the draft is the first rookie with four straight games of at least 130 yards . <p> Together , Elliott and Prescott were the first rookies with 1,000 yards passing and 500 yards rushing in the first five games . Prescott has 1,486 yards passing with seven touchdowns and one interception . <p> " There is no question that Dak and Zeke ... they 're inspiring the rest of the team , " Jones said . " This game is a lot about that . " <p> Prescott said a bond with Elliott developed soon after the draft -- long before they were the emerging twin celebrities getting asked in detail about their plans for the bye ( Prescott will be fishing with his family in Louisiana ; Elliott was n't very specific ) . <p> They 've been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included at times . They enjoy clowning around in the locker room , and they 're roommates on the road . <p> " He 's a good roommate , " Elliott said . " He studies a lot of film . He watches a lot of ' America 's Got Talent . ' He sits around with his headphones on his phone . " <p> Without Prescott 's emergence , their friendship might be a footnote . With it , the Twitter memes are frequent . <p> With Romo 's recovery continuing , Prescott is likely to be the starter when Dallas returns for a key NFC East game at home against Philadelphia on Oct. 30 . If Prescott is n't the starter in three weeks , it appears he will be in three years . <p> " I feel like my teammates believe in me , " he said . " And that 's what 's important to me , my teammates and coaches believing in me , having trust in me to get the job done . I think I 've earned that for the most part . "
