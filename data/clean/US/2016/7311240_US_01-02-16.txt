analyzing the global " state of racing " from a u.s. perspective is difficult because america 's fondness for oval track racing separates it from the rest of the world .  just as we have our own unique style and league for football , nascar has become synonymous for racing in the u.s. bob pockrass will assess the " state of nascar " in a separate story later this week , and indy car racing and formula one and their respective feeder networks also merit individual discussion . so we 'll start things out today with a look at the rest of the world of motorsports .  internationally , almost every major form of motorsports is road-racing based , and outside of f1 and nascar , arguably the most successful series in the world right now is staged on two wheels rather than four .  editor 's picks  maybe cool cars draw the stars -- and fans -- to the rolex 24 . whatever it was , the race proved to be intriguing and the fans seemed happy .  the fim motogp by the intense rivalry that has developed between champion riders valentino rossi and marc marquez . the changing of the guard between the old master and the heir apparent produced a tense atmosphere that has spilled over to the track in a dangerous way , similar to the psychological battle between ayrton senna and alain prost in f1 in the late 1980s and early ' 90s .  as a truly international formula , motogp is encountering the same problems and issues that f1 dealt with 10 or 20 years ago , mainly the transition from traditional european venues into asia and the middle east . motogp is also losing its footprint in the u.s. , currently lacking an american rider and dropping from three american races on the calendar as recently as 2013 to a single event this year at circuit of the americas in austin , texas .  if the personalities have come to the fore in motogp , the fia world endurance championship has done the best job of making the cars the stars .  the 24 hours of le mans remains one of the world nine-race championship that supports le mans is in its strongest position in decades . sports car racing has done a better job than f1 in terms of integrating modern automotive technology that is relevant to road cars , as reflected in the diesel-powered and hybrid prototypes from porsche , audi and toyota that compete in the top p1 class .  although the wec hosts an american round -- also at cota -- the u.s. is big enough to support a sports car series of its own . the problem is that the cars that people want to see -- the crazy p1 prototypes -- are legislated out of what is now known as the imsa weathertech sportscar championship and its crown jewel endurance races , the rolex 24 at daytona and the mobil 1 12 hours of sebring .  daytona , sebring , and road atlanta 's 10-hour petit le mans remain celebrated and successful events , but it 's frustrating to think about how sports car racing in america could be taken to another level if the factory p1 prototypes were allowed to participate .  the good being taken to more closely align the regulations for the wec 's p2 class that will take over as the top category for the imsa series .  even though the revamp of imsa 's prototype class is a year away , the last season where the old daytona prototypes and outgoing p2 cars compete for overall honors is still compelling . but the toughest competition in the series is in the gtlm class , with factory efforts from porsche , bmw , corvette , and a much ballyhooed return of the ford gt .  the nhra has a new tv partner it hopes can bring the excitement of drag racing to a live audience much more often than in the past . mark j. rebilas/usa today sports  the pirelli world challenge offers a sprint-race alternative to imsa 's shows , which run a minimum of 2-1/2 hours . often run in conjunction with indycar series events , the pwc includes factory efforts from the likes of cadillac and acura and the widest range of cars you 'll see on a grid anywhere in the world , ranging from most forms of motorsports , sedan racing is down from its peak 20 years ago . but " local " series like germany 's dtm and australian v8 supercars have successfully gone semi-international in an attempt to compensate for reduced interest at home .  the dtm still enjoys strong factory support from mercedes-benz , audi and bmw . but even before news broke that ford and gm division holden will cease car production in australia in a couple of years , v8 supercars opened the door for foreign manufacturers like nissan and volvo . like any formula , they were adapting to the times .  back in the u.s. , drag racing is n't quite as uniquely american as nascar , but it still occupies a special place in our culture . perhaps more than any other form of motorsports , drag racing is susceptible to the notion that most people have lost a hands-on connection with working on or hopping up their cars .  there 's no question that today 's street cars are faster , safer , more comfortable , more efficient and more reliable than little more than appliances , complex machines that require specialists for formerly simple tasks like changing oil or spark plugs .  television-friendly racing by series such as stadium super trucks are garnering more attention . cole burston/toronto star/getty images  under new leader peter clifford , the nhra has come out on offense , crafting an aggressive new media strategy that will feature the majority of its events televised live for the first time on fox sports 1 . marquee events like the u.s. nationals in indianapolis will be broadcast on the flagship fox network .  while a traditional form of motorsports like drag racing is getting a media makeover to remain competitive in the modern market , a more serious threat comes in the form of " made for tv " racing .  the x-games demonstrated that motorsports can be staged in a stadium environment with a tv-friendly format , and series like red bull global rallycross and robby gordon 's stadium super trucks have capitalized on race fans ' desire to see vehicles slide around in spectacular fashion . the format of short heat races lends span of modern sports fans .  if there 's one facet of racing that longtime fans will have to adapt to , it 's the changing sound of the sport , and novelty that it is , formula e in many ways is a glimpse into the future .  as long as there have been cars , people have raced them . formula e is racers preparing for the future , because they know that changing the way cars look or sound is n't going to extinguish the desire to see them pitted in competition .  the cars may change , and the way fans watch the action probably will too . like many sports , racing has suffered a decline in popularity from its peak years . but it 's not going away anytime soon .
