via @latimes : if you 're borrowing to buy a house , there 's almost never been a better time to do it  if you 're borrowing to buy a house , there 's almost never been a better time to do it .  interest rates on an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 4.1% this week , a low for the year , according to lending giant freddie mac .  they 've been bouncing in the low 4% range for months , not quite record territory but not far from it . it 's helping to ease the pain of home prices that have climbed by one-third in southern california over the last two years .  but at some point -- and fairly soon , forecasters say -- these cheap money days will end . when they do , the stop-and-start housing recovery could face the kind of hurdle it has n't seen in a long time .  low rates have propped up the housing market for years now . but with the federal reserve ending its so-called " quantitative easing " many market watchers are predicting rates will start to rise again soon . this time next year , the mortgage bankers assn. projects , the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will be 5.2% , its highest level since early 2010 .  at today 's 4.1% rate , the monthly payment on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with 20% down at los angeles county 's median price of $457,500 would be $1,768 , according to bankrate.com 's mortgage calculator . add a point and the monthly payment climbs to $2,009 .  that extra $241 a month is no small thing for a housing market that 's already struggling with affordability issues , said leslie appleton-young , chief economist at the california assn. of realtors .  " it 's going to worsen affordability , " she said . " all else remaining the same , higher rates are going to make it more difficult for people to get into housing . "  and coming after years of low rates -- when many homeowners either bought a house with a relatively cheap mortgage or refinanced into one -- fairly tight by historical standards .  roughly half of the nation 's 50 million home mortgages have interest rates at or below the current rates , said mark fleming , chief economist at real estate data firm corelogic . so if rates go up , buying anew would mean a more costly mortgage .  " that means you do n't have a lot of incentive to sell your home , " he said . " that could lead to a lack of supply going forward . "  it would be the reverse of a broader trend the housing market has enjoyed for 30 years now , fleming notes , a period when interest rates have moved generally downward from 18% in the early 1980s to as low as 3% early last year . in that time , he said , tens of millions of people have been able to sell a house and buy a new one at a cheaper interest rate , essentially getting more house for the same money . if rates start trending upward , that will flip .  " that 's what 's not that homeowners could n't benefit in other ways . tight supply could well boost prices , fleming notes , which could be a bigger incentive to sell than the higher rates are a deterrent to buy . if rates rise quickly , it 's likely a sign of inflation and wage growth , which could help more people afford a house . and people will buy and sell houses for all the non-financial reasons they always have , from growing families to new jobs to simply wanting to move .  " will it be more difficult ? yes . will people buy a smaller home ? maybe , " fleming said . " but we expect there 's going to be a black-and-white answer , and market forces do n't always work that way . "  indeed , when rates start to rise , there may well be a flurry of sales as buyers rush to lock in lower payments while they still can , said mark goldman , a mortgage broker who teaches real estate at san diego state university .  in the long run , help to damp home sales , which are already running well below historical averages . but they 'll be balanced out by clearer lending guidelines and slightly looser credit requirements . and mostly , goldman said , they 'll be taking place in a market that -- after years of booms and busts -- appears to be behaving somewhat normally .  " we 're in a period of extraordinary equilibrium right now , " he said . " do n't panic . "
