<h> The Streets of victory <h> Family , hard work , help Kaito Streets clinch individual , team titles <p> COLUMBUS , Ohio -- More than 10 years ago , Tomoko Streets wanted to find a sport that her Japan-born son , Kaito , would enjoy . <p> She picked fencing . Good choice . <p> Sunday in the championship round of the NCAA Fencing Championships at Ohio State 's St. John Arena , Kaito Streets was lifted up by his Penn State teammates onto their shoulders after Streets defeated Ferenc Valkai of St. John 's . Streets ' victory was the final step in Penn State 's 13th national championship in fencing . <p> Kaito 's dad was in the arena starting chants of " We are Penn State " while also texting Tomoko back in California to share the happy news . <p> Streets won a Junior Olympic championship in 2011 , but this was his crowning achievement . And it started with his mom years ago because she happened to see him playing with swords and knives during a kids ' activity in Japan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it , they wanted me to try something new , compared to baseball and basketball , " Kaito Streets said . " I did all kinds of sports . So did my brother . They wanted me to do something different than my brother . Fencing stuck with me . " <p> Over two days , Streets won 22 matches in saber , tying foil champion Gerek Meinhardt of Notre Dame for the most victories in the men 's tournament . Those victories helped Penn State win its first national championship since 2010 . And the team title mattered more to Streets than his individual championship . He could n't bear to see the Nittany Lions step into their bus ride home without the national championship trophy . <p> " We came in here wanting to win as a team , especially for all the seniors who had n't won yet . It would have been the second class to not win a championship , " Streets said . " So I did n't want that to happen . Especially like my mentor , Adrian Bak , a senior who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win a championship . I wanted to do it for him . <p> " It meant a lot that we won as a team . The individual was just a plus . " <p> The victory also meant something to interim coach Wes Glon . He is hoping to become head coach . <p> " A lot of recruits are coming because they expect to be on a winning team , " Glon said . " This will help us with recruits and everything . " <p> Streets dominated the saber field in the men 's tournament after arriving in Columbus with his confidence shaken . His sixth-place regional finish was a little bit better than his eighth-place finish as a freshman in 2013 . Preparations leading up to the NCAA championships were stressful . <p> " I struggled at regionals , " Streets said . " I thought going to regionals , I had a good game plan but it did n't work out . Adrian Bak just beat me down . They yelled at me . Training was tough . <p> In the midst of those struggles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to the gym and Streets is there . <p> " Five o'clock in the morning or Saturday evening , he will always be there , " Glon said . <p> Bak , who finished second at the regional , was expected to be the title contender for Penn State in saber . Instead , Streets blew through the field . He won 14 of 15 matches the first day , three more wins than Bak and one more than Shaul Gordon , who was runner-up at the 2013 NCAA championships with Penn State before transferring to Penn . <p> " I stayed humble . I did n't want to get overconfident , " Streets said . <p> " Coming in , I was very nervous . After the first day , my confidence went up . Talking to my dad , he told me , ' Do n't get big-headed . Stay humble . Just focus on every touch . It 's not over yet . Every touch , every bout counts . Just go for it . ' " <p> Sunday , he won another six round-robin bouts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He defeated Gordon 15-13 in the semifinals , then topped Valkai , a world championship team gold medalist with Hungary . <p> Already , Streets is thinking about 2015 . Tokomo , his mom , will be happy to hear it . <p> " Repeat . I want a repeat , " he said . " People are happy to win one , but I want to it more than once . Multiple times . "
