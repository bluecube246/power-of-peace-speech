This Is How Detroit Found Itself a Mysterious Pot of Gold

suddenly the cops and firemen and other municipal workers ' retirement does n't look so bleak in the motor city . but do n't try this at home .  more  to the great relief of firefighters , police and other public employees in bankrupt detroit , city fathers recently plugged a huge hole in their pension plans . for now , anyway , something close to these employees ' retirement dreams have been restored .  but how did they do it ? just a few weeks ago , detroit leaders pegged the pension shortfall at $3.5 billion -- about 20% of the city 's total indebtedness -- and they were threatening to slash benefits beyond already expected cuts of up to 14% for cops and firemen and 34% for other workers . miraculously , workers are now being assured that benefits cuts will be comparatively tame , amounting to less than a 5% reduction for those hardest hit .  where did the money come from ? who found the pot of gold that is enabling the city to fill such a big funding no one found so much as a single hard penny . actuaries simply juggled a few numbers on the city ledger and , voila , a paper windfall appeared . do n't try this at home .  the most important accounting change was the assumed rate of return on investments held in the city 's two big retirement funds . previously , the annual rate of return was estimated at 6.25% and 6.5% on the two funds . now the city is assuming a rate of return of 6.75% on both funds . why the bump ? in part , anyway , the city seems to be taking heart in the stock market 's big gain last year , when after lackluster returns the past decade or so the s&amp;p 500 rebounded with a glowing 32% total return .  a sustained higher rate of return would mean more annual income for the funds , making them better able to meet benefits promises with the same amount of assets . but the question remains : is the higher return assumption realistic ? one year is not a trend . many returns ahead . a bankruptcy judge still must rule on the rosier projections .  a pension fund manager boosting the return assumption because stocks finally had a good year is a little like you at home predicting next winter wo n't be so cold and slashing your heating budget . you might be right . but it 's just a guess -- and if the guess is wrong you will have to find the money elsewhere to heat the house . your finances only looked better briefly ; the picture dimmed as soon as another cold winter hit .  so how realistic is the 6.75% return assumption ? in the detroit general retirement system , annualized returns over the past seven years have been 3.9% , according to one analysis . the past five years , public pension funds have had a median annualized return of 5.3% , according to another analysis . not so good , right ?  but let 's not throw detroit 's leaders under the bus just yet . because people generally work and accrue benefits over 40 years or so , pension funds fund return over the past 25 years has been 8.6% . the typical pension fund manager today assumes long-term rates of return between 7% and 8% . so detroit has company , and may even seem cautious .  among others , warren buffett has scolded pension managers for not recognizing a fundamental shift to slower growth and lower returns . but the new assumptions in the motor city are n't completely unsupportable . maybe the city 's employees will catch a much-needed break and get the higher returns that pension managers hope for .
