<p> " There 's an island in the middle of a river in Liberia , deep in the jungle of West Africa that 's said to be home to over 60 chimpanzees , all infected with contagious diseases . They were released there years ago after being used for medical research and now they roam wild . " <p> So begins a new 17-minute-long documentary ( embedded below ) from online magazine Vice and 20th Century Fox ( Vice Media investors and the makers of " Dawn of the Planet of the Apes " ) . The project had a film crew travel to Monrovia , Liberia to see just what has happened on Monkey Island , a place where chimps used in the Vilab medical research program were retired after experimentation . As part of the program , launched by the New York Blood Center in the ' 70s , over 100 chimps were infected with diseases like hepatitis and river blindness in order to find cures , the documentary says . <h> Related stories <p> In addition to traveling to Africa , the documentary team heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former head of the project -- and that 's where the film truly gets engaging . Brotman was in Liberia during two extremely bloody civil wars . <p> Through all of the turbulence , including the loss of her husband who was shot in the conflict , she managed to provide refuge for both the chimps and a group of women and children who were affected by the violence . " When we went to the island to feed the chimps , we would see bodies floating in the water , sometimes women with babies tied to their back , " she recalls at one particularly poignant moment in the documentary . <p> While the tale is definitely dark , there is a bright spot near the end . Working with a team of Liberians , the New York Blood Center continues to feed the chimps , most -- if not all -- of whom have recovered from their diseases and continue to live out their lives on a very real " Island of the Apes.
