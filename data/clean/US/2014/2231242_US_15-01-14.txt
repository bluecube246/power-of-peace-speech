His research includes the isotope physiology and diets of modern mammals as well as the history of diets of different mammalian lineages extending over millions of years . Along with a colleague , he showed that the composition of human hair reflects the region where a person lives . <p> " Hair records the history of diet , geography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " In this talk I will explore some of the applications of natural variations in the stable isotopes of hair and show how it can be used in wildlife ecology and forensics . An advantage of using hair is that it is a passive recorder , and life history is preserved without active observation of activities . " <p> Global climate and environmental change , and the associated degradation of ecosystems , together form the biggest issue facing society today . UCR 's EDGE Institute aims to examine life in this changing environment , focusing on carbon ( molecules to organisms ) , nutrients , and water at various temporal and spatial scales . It brings together UCR scientists from the biological , chemical , and physical sciences to examine particular questions or issues . <p> Directing the institute will be the holder of the Wilbur W. Mayhew Chair , recently endowed by anonymous donors who are passionate about the ecology of the southwest .
