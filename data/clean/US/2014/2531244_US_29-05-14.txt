training the brain to lift toddlers out of poverty  it 's a sad fact that children born in poverty start out at a disadvantage and continue to fall further behind kids who are more privileged as they grow up . in developing countries , chiefly in africa and asia , some 200 million children under age 5 wo n't reach the same milestones -- for physical growth , school performance , and earnings later on -- as children who are less deprived . but a new analysis of a long-term study in jamaica shows that surprisingly simple ways of stimulating children 's mental development can have dramatic benefits later in life .  the children were participants in the jamaican study , a project geared toward improving cognitive development begun in the mid-1980s by child health specialists sally grantham-mcgregor of university college london and susan walker of the university of the west indies , mona , in jamaica . they focused on children between the ages of 9 and 24 months whose growth was stunted , placing them in the bottom 5% of height for their ) . children of normal height in the same neighborhoods were also studied for comparison .  for 2 years , community health workers visited the families weekly . one group was given nutritional assistance only ( a formula containing 66% of daily recommended calories , along with vitamins and minerals ) . one group received a mental and social stimulation program only , and one group got stimulation and nutritional assistance . a final group had no intervention and served as a control . the mental stimulation program involved giving parents simple picture books and handmade toys , and encouraging them to read and sing to their children and point out names of objects , shapes , and colors . they were also taught better ways to converse and respond to their toddlers . these everyday interactions are n't always part of the culture in low-income countries , explains paul gertler , an economist at the university of california , berkeley . " parents might have five or six kids and few toys . they might be working really hard and have a lot of competing demands . they might , or how important and effective it is , " he says . past research attests to the importance of everyday conversation for children 's mental development : a recent study suggests that children of affluent parents do better in life in large part because their parents talk to them more .  follow-up studies over the next 20 years revealed that the jamaican children who received the mental stimulation had better grades and higher iqs , showed fewer signs of depression , and got in fewer fights . the new study , reported online today in science , focused on the children 's economic achievement as young adults . gertler , grantham-mcgregor , walker , and colleagues tracked down 105 out of the original 129 growth-stunted children . those who had received the stimulation intervention had earned 25% more than the children in the control group . even more exciting , gertler notes , is that they had closed the gap -- in physical and economic stature -- between themselves and children in their neighborhoods with normal height and weight . adding nutritional assistance to the mental stimulation did n't own had no effect -- likely because this kind of intervention must be used before a child 's growth has been stunted , gertler says .  " mental and social stimulation at around 1 year of age really matter , " gertler says . " it was enough to reduce and possibly eliminate inequality in the long term . " gertler emphasizes that the interventions were inexpensive , consisting of toys , books , and conversation -- not pricey , high-tech gadgets like ipads , for example .  jere behrman , an economist at the university of pennsylvania who was not involved in the research , says the study is the first to demonstrate a long-term economic benefit to early intervention stimulation programs in developing countries . but he is more cautious about saying that the program greatly reduces inequality . " a 25% increase in earnings will improve the welfare of people who are very poor , and that 's something to be glad about . but it may not reduce overall inequality by very much . " he points out that although the mentally stimulated children caught their later earnings did n't begin to compare to those of more affluent kids .  still , behrman agrees that the simplicity of the interventions in the jamaican study is a point in its favor . " flying in world-class psychologists to work with the kids for hours would give impressive results , but that would n't be easy to duplicate . " the jamaican study 's methods now are being used in bangladesh , india , and colombia . the study provides proof that " homemade toys and weekly visits from someone from within the community can also have a dramatic impact , " behrman says .  joan lombardi , who was deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development in the u.s. department of health and human services from 2009 to 2011 and is now a senior adviser to the bernard van leer foundation in the hague , the netherlands , says the study adds to the growing body of research from around the world confirming that what happens in the early years has an impact on long-term health , learning , and well-being . " investing in " it 's time to translate this growing science into improved policies and new investments in young children and their families around the world . "  *clarification , 2 june , 11:29 a.m. : this article has been updated to clarify that according to jere behrman , the study is the first to demonstrate an economic benefit for early intervention programs that focus on mental and social stimulation in developing countries . behrman 's research in guatemala has shown that programs aimed at improving nutrition for infants and toddlers can improve earnings in adulthood .
