Clay Enos/Warner Bros .  Is it May 6 , 2016 yet ?  The first picture of Henry Cavill as Supermanin Batman v. Superman : Dawn of Justice was released Thursday , nearly two months after director Zack Snyder tweeted the first look of Ben Affleck as Batman .  The photo , which first appeared in USA Today , shows the Developing the character -- both as Clark Kent and as Superman -- is a challenge , Snyder tells the newpspaper , but there 's also " the fun of trying to figure out what to put in front of him that 's difficult . "  According to Snyder , Cavill is more comfortable playing the iconic character in this movie . " We 've both created this guy and we can push him around a little bit , " says the director , who cast Cavill to play the lead role in 2013 's Man of Steel . " The more time I spend with Henry , the more he 's Superman to me . "  Many wondered why Snyder would add anotherwell-known character to the sequel . He understands the worry . Because of Christopher Nolan 's Dark Knight trilogy , he says , " I was in no rush to put Batman in the movie . But on the other hand it seemed organic the way our story was unfolding to start to feather him in . " The director ca n't say exactly how the relationship say there is a ' v ' in between their names " in the movie title , Snyder says . Having the " v " instead of " vs. " is a way " to keep it from being a straight ' versus ' movie , even in the most subtle way . "  Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice is currently filming in Detroit , although Cavill and Affleck have only filmed a few scenes together with Snyder . " It 's never really been done and it 's kinda cool , " he admits .  Like Snyder , both Cavill , 31 , and Affleck , 41 , realize the magnitude of the movie .  " You can talk all you want about other superhero movies , but it 's Batman and Superman , let 's just be honest , " the filmmaker says of the DC Comics characters . " I do n't know how you get bigger than that .
