Stephen Weber , chief medical officer at the University of Chicago 's Medical Center , talks about the decision to allow seriously injured 16- and 17-year-olds to receive care at the pediatric trauma unit .  Patrick M. O'Connell and Lolly BoweanChicago Tribune  Community members and activists have been pushing U. of C. to allow increased trauma care access .  The University of Chicago 's Comer Children 's Hospital is taking steps to raise the age limit for patients admitted to its pediatric trauma unit , a move to expand care to 16- and 17-year-olds who are seriously injured .  Community members and activists have been pushing the U. of C. for more access to trauma care for years , citing a injured patients , including victims of violence .  On Tuesday , neighborhood leaders and activists counted a hospital announcement as a victory .  The move means that hundreds more young people who are injured can receive emergency care closer to their own homes , said Veronica Morris-Moore , a youth organizer and activist from Woodlawn .  " If there is any community that needs treatment for trauma , it is the South Side , " said Morris-Moore as she stood outside the front entrance of the university 's medical center on East 58th Street and South Maryland Avenue . " Although this is a victory for the coalition , it is not our end goal . It is not our main goal . Our main goal is that the South Side of Chicago be provided with a level one trauma center . "  Advocates say the expanded pediatric care center is needed to serve the community and victims of violence who often are transported miles away for specialized medical care . The extra miles can mean the difference between life and death .  University of Chicago thinking about the expanded pediatric trauma center before recent demonstrations , but heard the desires of the activists . The pediatric trauma center at Comer Children 's Hospital currently admits children 15 and younger , which is how the state defines pediatric patients .  " We listen closely to all of the voices in the community , " she said . " Absolutely we heard their voice . "  Medical center leaders plan to submit formal plans to the state health department within the next few months and hope to begin treating additional patients within a year , O'Keefe said . The hospital will have to hire additional medical personnel , since O'Keefe anticipates the hospital serving close to 120 additional patients a year .  " This will mean more accessibility , more availability and an extension of the services of our clinical team to more members of the community , " O'Keefe said .  Trauma center funding  Armando L. Sanchez , Chicago Tribune  Protesters march over the lack of funding for a trauma center at the University of Chicago on the school 's campus a trauma center at the University of Chicago on the school 's campus . ( Armando L. Sanchez , Chicago Tribune )  Community residents , some University of Chicago students and activists for youth have been rallying for a South Side trauma unit since August 2010 . The activists also have tied the trauma center issue to the university 's bid for a possible library for President Barack Obama , drawing national attention .  " This is a strategic move to combat some of the things we exposed , " Morris-Moore said . " I do think this is a step towards showing themselves as deserving of the library . I hope they do n't think this is the only step it takes . "  Although conversations about the need for a South Side trauma center have gone on for years , the more recent protests gained urgency after the shooting death of Damian Turner , an 18-year-old activist who had to be rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for care after he was shot . His friends and family believe Turner would have survived if he had gotten the shooting occurred .  Activists targeted the university in part because the school is surrounded by neighborhoods marked by poverty and violence . As those residents struggled , the university boasted a billion dollar endowment and announced plans to raise even more for its medical center .  " We clearly have the capacity to absorb this expansion , " said Dr. Philip Verhoef , an intensive care unit physician at the U. of C. and one of several doctors and medical staff who have joined in the fight to expand the hospital 's reach . " We can see all day , everyday , the effect of not having trauma services . We recognize there is an injustice there . The university has the resources to at least contribute to being a solution . "  University officials said the decision came after years of talking about how the medical center can more effectively serve its neighbors , but said pressure from activists also played a role in the decision .  " This has been part of an ongoing discussion and consideration really over the last several years for the medical center .  The U. of C. has an emergency room in addition to the pediatric trauma center , but its adult trauma center closed more than 25 years ago , creating a so-called trauma desert on the South Side . Eight of Cook County 's nine level one trauma centers serving adults are north or west of downtown . The South and Southwest sides and the county 's southern suburbs are served by Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn .  Many victims of violence in South Side neighborhoods , including teens , end up being transported to trauma centers at either Northwestern Memorial Hospital on the Near North Side or Cook County-owned Stroger Hospital on the West Side . Northwestern can treat trauma patients from as far as 12 miles away .
