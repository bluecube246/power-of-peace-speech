digital-media advertising is now bigger than national-tv advertising and is expected to exceed total tv advertising spending by 2018 . this shift to digital is driving an unprecedented number of customers to websites and landing pages . this is also creating new problems and bigger opportunities for entrepreneurs that can figure out how to effectively respond to these prospects .  how big is the opportunity ? well , have you ever reached out to a business 's website , filled out a form showing interest only to be completely ignored ? of course you have . in fact , 65 percent of all companies admit that they have no process to nurture leads .  i recently created a mystery-shop campaign to show companies just how big this problem and opportunity is . three companies with three completely different products hired me to evaluate their website response and sales teams .  one was a luxury jewelry store , another a large group of automotive dealerships , and the third was a service company . the automobile dealership sent an automated response to the lead and days .  having looked into this follow-up problem , i can tell you it is massive . did you know 44 percent of all sales people give up after one follow-up call ? who allows this to happen ? companies that nurture leads have 47 percent higher profit margins than companies that do not . this means prospects put the value on quick response , not on lowest price .  smaller businesses and solo entrepreneurs often point the finger to limited infrastructure to handle follow up , but the reality is if you are a small-business owner , this is where you need to invest . i know what it 's like to be a one-man show because i was one for too many years . but in order to survive , i made sure i followed up fast and over long periods of time .  why do salespeople and companies fail to follow up ? my company surveyed over 800 sales people and 500 businesses that said they do n't follow up because there are too many leads , leads are cold by the time they get follow up .  the reality is there is no commitment to follow up . the culture of your company has made it ok not to follow up . now , in defense of the sales team , if your salespeople do n't know how to effectively follow up , what to say , how to text , when to email , when to call , when to offer more information or simple things like how to get the lead on the phone , then how can you even make a second call , much less the five to 12 calls necessary to convert the internet lead to a purchase ?
