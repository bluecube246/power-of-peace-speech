This year 's annual conference run by the School Nutrition Association is not without politics  More  The 68th Annual National Conference of the School Nutrition Association is finishing up today in Boston , and it 's not go on without controversy .  Here 's some backstory : When the Obama administration revamped the school lunch requirements , they received a lot of praise and counted among their champions the School Nutrition Association . But now , the group , which is a national organization of school nutrition professionals , is heading up a lobbying campaign to let schools opt out of the requirements saying they are too restrictive and costly . ( You can read in detail what the group is pushing for here . )  Many experts in the school-nutrition world are surprised by the stance the SNA has taken and some of its members have resigned , voicing criticism of SNA for accepting sponsorship money from food companies .  At the same time , Congress is considering legislation to delay by one year some of the school-lunch regulations , as the ongoing debate about school nutrition , it should n't be surprising that this year 's convention -- which brings together 6,000 school nutrition professionals and industry members -- has been mired in politics . As Politico reported : Sam Kass , the Executive Director of Let 's Move ! was even turned down when he asked to speak at the conference this year .  Though the conference has long allowed food companies to be involved , their new position on the school lunch standards have some nutrition groups and experts skeptical . And that makes the presence of fast food and junk food at the event all the more surprising .
