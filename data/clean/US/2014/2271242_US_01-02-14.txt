( Cathleen Allison/Las Vegas Review-Journal ) <p> Editor 's Note : Nevada 150 is a yearlong series highlighting the people , places and things that make up the history of the state . <p> PYRAMID LAKE <p> In the beginning , there was man and he was lonely . <p> Woman was aware of man 's existence and searched through the lands that became Nevada until she found him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for five days . Each night they drew closer . Then they married and had many children . <p> Some of their children were good , and others were very bad . Man sent the bad children to the West . Woman began weeping for her lost children . Her tears created Pyramid Lake . The striking rock formation in a publicly closed section of Pyramid Lake still shows " Stone Mother " looking to the West with an empty baby basket at her feet . <p> So that is how history began , at least in the creation story of the Northern Paiute at Pyramid Lake , Nevada 's largest native tribe . Other tribes have different creation stories , but Pyramid Lake remains a holy place to American Indian people everywhere . It even was the stand-in for the Sea of Galilee in the biblical movie " The Greatest Story Ever Told . " <p> Creating a unified history of Nevada 's tribes is impossible since they had no written languages and were widely splintered , living in small groups throughout a state that historically fluctuated between wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Lake Lahontan , a vast lake over much of northwestern Nevada . <p> Among the Northern Paiute , or " Numa , " there are 23 tribal bands . They have 13 dialects and varying stories . About 45,000 residents , or 1.6 percent of the state 's population , is Native American . About 8,800 live on reservations , including 1,735 at the 725-square-mile Pyramid Lake reservation . <p> Early tribes <p> Carbon dating of petroglyphs near Pyramid Lake put people in Nevada between 11,000 and 14,800 years ago . These are the oldest petroglyphs in North America , according to state archaeologist Gene Hattori . <p> A human cranium at Pyramid Lake was dated back 9,600 years . Artifacts found in Southern Nevada date back 13,000 years and were associated with the hunting of ice age animals , Hattori added . <p> He said today 's Numa are likely descendants of people who displaced earlier tribes and have resided in Nevada for 500 to 1,000 years . There are oral histories of the Paiutes conquering earlier natives , he said . To the winners , regardless of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The first whites to invade Paiute country were mountain men , fur trappers and explorers like Jedediah Smith in 1826 and Peter Skene Ogden in 1828 . <p> Ogden 's Hudson Bay Company trapped 4,000 beaver in the Humboldt River . That decimated the beaver population in Nevada for generations . It was only the beginning . <p> By May 1860 , the trickle of white settlers turned into a river . Miners in Virginia City were burning off pinyon pines that natives used for their nuts . Anglo ranchers were developing prime agricultural lands near Genoa . <p> Tensions boiled over . <p> That month , brothers Oscar and James Williams , traders at Williams Station just west of current day Fallon , kidnapped two 12-year-old Paiute girls , raped them and threw them into a hole under their cabin . <p> The Numa searched in vain for the girls until a tribal member heard them scream when he went to the station to trade his horse . The girls ' father was notified . The Paiutes shot one man outside the station and burned the cabin holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Virginia City and Carson City , demanded revenge . A militia of 105 volunteers was organized . The militia pursued the Numa north up the Truckee River to near present-day Nixon . <p> A massacre followed -- a massacre of whites . <p> Within three days , the Numa killed 76 militia members . The rest retreated to Virginia City and Carson City . The greatest battle between American Indians and white settlers in Nevada 's history had ended in victory for the tribe . <p> Within a few days , however , more than 200 Army soldiers and 500 volunteers banded in California . They marched to Nevada and within a month defeated the tribal people . The soldiers claimed they killed 160 Numa and lost only two of their own . The Paiute claimed they lost four . <p> Soldiers quickly constructed Fort Churchill on the plains east of Carson City . For the next nine years , troops patrolled Northern Nevada to protect settlers from the Numa . It was n't necessary . Resistance had already ended . <p> Racism and resentment <p> American Indians eventually were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo ranchers , working on lands where they roamed without restraint for thousands of years . Even today , the anger of some natives is felt . <p> Witness the Lake Tahoe Summit in 2010 . <p> Native American elder Charles Walker Sr. demanded that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , and two other senators return Lake Tahoe -- the traditional summer home of the Washoe -- to tribal control . <p> Clearly embarrassed by his demands before a crowd of hundreds , Reid 's friend John Lee , now the North Las Vegas mayor , whispered in Walker 's ear to end his talk . Walker persisted , and the crowd got an idea of the tribe 's resentment . <p> The ultimate slight may have been the U.S. decision to deny American Indians citizenship and the right to vote until 1924 -- after white men , black men and women . The federal law prohibiting tribal people from buying alcohol was not repealed until 1953 . <p> Until that decade , a 6 p.m. whistle in Gardnerville was a sign for all American Indians to leave Gardnerville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Reno-Sparks Indian Colony Chairman Arlan Melendez spoke of Nevada 's history of sundown laws in an interview with Indian Country Today in 2011 . <p> " Reno was a very racist place , but over the years it 's become more diversified as more Hispanic people moved into the area , " Melendez said . " Sadly , that 's not the case in many rural communities where there 's still a lot of good old boy attitudes . " <p> Washoe County Paiute Dewey Sampson in 1938 was the first American Indian elected to the Nevada Legislature . He served one session . <p> Former Assembly Speaker John Oceguera is an enrolled member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe in Schurz . He is the highest-ranking American Indian to serve in Nevada state government . <p> During his legislative career , Oceguera said tribal members would occasionally call on him for bills , specifically those to ensure natives served on state boards and commissions . But mainly they were concerned with good business legislation , he said . <p> He acknowledges that some anger still exists among natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty largely had been taken away , " he said . " We were promised land and sovereignty , but eventually those lands were not the best lands . Is there resentment ? Maybe a little .
