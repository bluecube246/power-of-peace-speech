OUYA Founding Team Member And VP Of Product Development Departs  0  One of OUYA 's founding members , Muffi Ghadiali , has left the company , TechCrunch has learned . Ghadiali was instrumental in helping launch the OUYA on Kickstarter and to the consumer market , and has previous experience working for Lab126 ( Amazon 's hush-hush projects division , which birthed the Kindle ) , HP and Synaptics . A source familiar with Ghadiali 's work told us he was instrumental in the creation of OUYA as a viable consumer product , and one of the most experienced CE experts on the team .  Ghadiali led key teams at OUYA , including those involved in industrial and product design of the hardware ; mechanical , electrical and RF engineering , and firmware development .

At Amazon , he was a product manager for Kindle hardware .  OUYA provided the  OUYA is focusing more on the next phase of the business and product development .

A well-placed source tells TechCrunch that the decision to leave OUYA was Ghadiali 's own , not the company 's .  OUYA definitely seems to be occupying rocky waters at the moment , but it also says it 's excited about the next phase of its " business and product development . " We 'll stay unfortunate to see key early talent making an exit .  0  CrunchBase  OverviewOUYA is a new kind of game console for the television that brings together an open development experience -- where any creator can publish a game to the living room -- with an accessible and affordable console at $99 , and where all games are free to try .
