Nate Silver claims that his new blog is a data journalism organization . Silver is a numbers guy , and because his analyses of political polls proved more accurate than those made by the often inept traditional media competition , he has become celebrated as a genius , if not quite a shaman . How ironic , then , that with over 97 percent of the 11,944 peer-reviewed studies of " global climate change " or " global warming " between 1991-2011 endorsing the consensus on anthropogenic global warming , with almost every scientific society or association long before having concurred on the consensus , and with the U.S. National Academies of Science and the British Royal Society now saying that the consensus is more certain than ever , Silver would hire as one of his science writers the egregious purveyor of disinformation on climate change , Roger Pielke , Jr . And the worst part about it , given Silver 's reputation as a statistics guy , is that Pielke often is criticized for butchering statistics and data analysis .  " Given Nate 's professed to see him hire for his new venture an individual who has displayed a pattern of sloppiness when it comes to the analysis of climate data , " said top climate scientist Michael Mann via email . Pointing to a chapter in Silver 's recent book that addresses climate change ( for which Mann was interviewed ) he adds , " Sadly , this is n't the first time Nate has been led astray when it comes to dealing with the science of climate change . "  After having been interviewed by Silver for that book , and despite obviously liking Silver , personally , when Mann read the result , he wrote an excoriating critique that should be read in its entirety .  Much more below the fold .  Among the many lowlights :  As a result , Nate 's chapter on climate change ( Chapter 12 : " A Climate of Healthy Skepticism " ) is marred by straw man claims that do n't stand up to scrutiny . These include the assertion that ( a ) climate scientist James Hansen 's famous 1988 predictions ( b ) " the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) settles on just one forecast that is endorsed by the entire group " ( pure nonsense -- even the most casual reading of the IPCC reports reveals that great care taken to emphasize the non-trivial spreadamong model predictions , and to denote regions where there is substantial disagreement between the projections from different models ) and that ( c ) " relatively little is understood " about the El Nino cycle ( here I imagine that Nate might have misinterpreted our own discussion about the matter ; I explained in our discussion that there are still open questions about how climate change will influence the El Nino phenomenon -- but that hardly means that we know " relatively little " about the phenomenon itself ! In fact , we know quite a bit about it ) . Finally , and perhaps most troubling ( d ) while Nate 's chapter title explicitly acknowledges the importance of distinguishing " signal " from " noise " , and Nate does gives this topic some lip service , he repeatedly falls ( the noise ) can tell us something about predictions of global warming trends ( the signal ) . They ca n't -- they really ca n't .  Nate 's view of uncertainty , and its implications for climate model predictions , is particularly misguided . He asserts that the projections of the IPCC forecasts have been " too aggressive " , but that is simply wrong . It neglects that in many cases , e.g. as regards the alarming rate of Arctic sea ice decline ( we saw a new record low set just weeks ago ) , the climate models have been far too cautious ; We are decades ahead of schedule relative to what the models predicted . Uncertainty cuts both ways , and in many respects -- be it the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice , or the melting of the ice sheets -- it is cutting against us . Uncertainty , as many economists recognize , is thus a reason for action , not inaction ! I 'm surprised someone as sharp as Nate just does n't appear to get that .  And Gore , and deriding his cherry-picking and misrepresenting Mann 's own interview statements for the purpose of promoting a false narrative :  Most disappointing to me of all was the false equivalence that Nate draws between the scientific community 's efforts to fight back against intentional distortions and attacks by an industry-funded attack machine , and the efforts of that attack machine itself . He characterizes this simply as a battle between " consensus " scientists and " skeptical " individuals , as if we 're talking about two worthy adversaries in a battle . This framing is flawed on multiple levels , not the least of which is that those he calls " skeptics " are in fact typically no such thing . There is a difference between honest skepticism -- something that is not only valuable but necessary for the progress of science -- and pseudo-skepticism , i.e. denialism posing as " skepticism " for the sake of obscuring , rather than clarifying , what is known .  Which brings us back to Pielke .  . @TheCostOfEnergy @thackerpd @FiveThirtyEight And Justin Bieber could be the site -- @MichaelEMann  Roger Pielke , Jr . is the single most disputed and debunked person in the entire realm of people who publish regularly on disasters and climate change . He trashes the reputation of any scientist who even suggests that there is the tiniest link whatsoever between climate change and extreme weather even though he himself has stated such a link exists ( click here , reposted below ) .  Pielke is a political scientist , not a climate scientist , and he recently played politics in testimony before Congress , including an attempt to refute President Obama 's science adviser , John P. Holdren , who has linked climate change and drought . Holdren , who is the former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , wrote a scathing response ( pdf here ) , specifically noting that Pielke 's views are " not representative of main-stream views on this topic in the climate-science community , " while including a list of sources from peer-reviewed scientific literature that support the link .  In the rest of this response , I will show Climate Change Science Program ( CCSP ) about U.S. droughts is missing a crucial adjacent sentence in the CCSP report , which supports my position about drought in the American West . I will also show that Dr. Pielke 's statements about global drought trends , while irrelevant to my comments about drought in California and the Colorado River Basin , are seriously misleading , as well , concerning what is actually in the UN Panel 's latest report and what is in the current scientific literature .  The key words are seriously misleading , because as is the case with all who misinform and disinform on climate issues , this is n't a question of having a different opinion , it 's a matter of being wrong . It 's a matter of repeating false accusations even after they have been debunked . It 's a question of intent and integrity . It 's a pattern :  Stefan Rahmstorf , Head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , and his colleagues were targeted by Pielke upon the release of their 2011 paper PNAS ) examining the increase of extreme events in a warming world . The paper found that the record-breaking Russian heat of 2010 in particular " is , with 80 percent probability , due to the long-term climatic warming trend . "  Pielke took issue with the conclusions and methodologies , saying he stood by his critique -- even after Rahmstorf provided clarification that disputed Pielke 's claims -- and accusing the authors of " cherry-picking . "  " Faced with this kind of libelous distortion I will not answer any further questions from Pielke now or in future , " Rahmstorf commented . " As an aside , our paper was reviewed not only by two climate experts but in addition by two statistics experts coming from other fields . "  To be so wrong so often , and to so persistently butcher data suggests that Pielke has an agenda , and will promote that agenda regardless of the facts :  Roger Pielke Jr . is a political scientist who has publicly questioned the scientific integrity of more climate scientists than just about anyone else on ( as I document here ) .  That is no doubt a key reason Pielke was included on Foreign Policy 's " Guide to Climate Skeptics . " No doubt that 's why the websites that most prominently feature or reprint Pielke 's attacks are climate denial sites like WattsUpWithThat and ClimateDepot . It is also why he is probably the single most disputed and debunked person in the science blogosphere , especially on the subject of extreme weather and climate change ( see here and here ) .  Pielke seems to be at war with the actual data , which would seem to undermine the entire premise of Silver 's blog . Silver is an expert on statistics , but the disaster of hiring Pielke is n't only about ignoring the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change , it 's also about Pielke 's own problems with statistics , for which he often is criticized , if not ridiculed .  Sometimes , Pielke 's agenda takes him so far down the rabbit hole that he makes a complete fool of himself ( to be generous ) . change ( a premise that is absurd at face value ) , Pielke six years ago claimed there were 1,264 times as many news stories about a study finding a 1,000 year high in hurricanes as about one claiming there has been no increase in the past century . The former was co-authored by the climate scientist Michael Mann . Oops :  The fun is in the comments as folks try to explain to Pielke that there is a film director called Michael Mann and that maybe Pielke should n't count those stories . Pielke comes back with the claim that restricting the search to " Michael Mann " + nature + hurricanes + Aug 13-15 gives 1,412 stories . Some folks might wonder how restricting the search gives you more results , but not Pielke . In fact , if you read what Google says at the link Pielke gave it says that there are " about 20 ? , and if you look at all the results there are just 11 . A similar search for the Landsea paper gives 5 news stories . This difference may be other in The Journal of Climate .  Which was updated :  Soon after I posted this , Pielke finally made a correction , allowing that being out by a couple of orders of magnitude was a " bit sloppy " . Heaven knows how wrong he would have to be before he admitted to being sloppy or very sloppy .  @thackerpd @NateSilver538 @capitalclimate @climatebrad and maybe the TEPCO people on nuclear safety ? -- @bernsteinr  Pielke has consistently been found lacking in accurately representing even basic statistics , whether it be about probability or t-tests or temperature records or the accuracy of models when compared to observed data .  . @natesilver538 I hope the irony of bringing Pielke to a stats-branded enterprise does n't cause all of reality to implode . @FiveThirtyEight -- @thingsbreak  And Pielke 's first post at Silver 's new site , attempting to downplay the connection between climate change and extreme weather events , is in the same mold , and already is being eviscerated :  " Pielke 's piece is deeply misleading , confirming some of my worst fears outlet for misinformation when it comes to the issue of human-caused climate change , " said Michael Mann , director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University . " Pielke uses a very misleading normalization procedure that likely serves to remove the very climate change-related damage signal that he claims to not be able to find . " ...  Kevin E. Trenberth is a senior climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research :  " This is the same old wrong Roger , " Trenberth said by e-mail . " He is demonstrably wrong and misleads . "  Pielke 's post cites his own previous claim that the fifth report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) found " little evidence of a spike in the frequency or intensity of floods , droughts , hurricanes and tornadoes , " and that future spikes of extreme weather will be statistically undetectable for decades .  Dr. John Abraham , a thermal science professor at the University of St. Thomas famous for his formation of the Climate Science Rapid Response Team , criticized You should know that we have already detected significant increases in Atlantic hurricane intensity , in extreme heat waves , large precipitation events and regional droughts , " Abraham wrote in an e-mail to Nate Silver expressing his disdain for the article , forwarded to Climate Progress .  " It 's ludicrous to say that extremes have not increased , and they have certainly increased in ways that are completely consistent with expectations based on atmospheric physics and climate model projections in response to increasing greenhouse gases , " Jennifer Francis , a research professor at Rutgers University 's Institute of Marine and Coastal Science who specializes in the connection between climate change and extreme weather , said .  In the comments of Pielke 's post , it is being pointed out that Pielke ( yet again ) cherry-picked data , citing a study by the German reinsurance company Munich Re , while using the data from 1990 onward , even though the study itself compiled data starting 10 years earlier , in 1980 . There is no reason to omit the first 10 years of data , except the data prove what Pielke wants them to prove . Munich Re itself , using all the data , came to the exact opposite conclusion of Pielke , an inconvenient truth that Pielke somehow neglects to mention .  In a follow-up post , responding to the extensive criticism , Pielke cites an analysis by two scholars from the London School of Economics ( LSE ) , but ignores that their abstract ( pdf ) specifically states that because of their " inability to control for defensive mitigation measures , one can not infer from our analysis that there have definitely not been more frequent and/or more intensive weather-related natural hazards over the study period already . " Which would seem to undermine Pielke 's attempt to make exactly such an inference . Pielke also ignores a later analysis by the same two LSE scholars , wherein they find " no significant trends at the global level , but we detect statistically significant upward trends in normalized insured losses from all non-geophysical disasters as well as from certain specific disaster types in the United States and West Germany . "  them to prove , but his cherry-picking the data and analysis to make it seem otherwise proves everything about Pielke . Right out of the gate , Pielke 's contribution to Silver 's site is to make a mockery of it .  Climate change is the most important issue humanity has ever faced . On the questions of whether it is happening , whether humans burning fossil fuels are the primary driver , and whether the impacts are happening and will only grow worse , there is no credible debate . The scientific consensus is overwhelming . To promote disinformation and misinformation about climate change is inexcusable and unconscionable , but by hiring Roger Pielke , Jr. , that is exactly what Nate Silver is doing . It would be bad enough if Silver had hired Pielke in conjunction with a credible climate scientist , to create the sort of false equivalency that the traditional media so loves to promote , but to have hired Pielke at all undermines the very premise of what Silver claims to be trying to do . It undermines the credibility of Silver 's blog not this was a mistake that will be corrected , or whether it tells us something about Silver himself .
