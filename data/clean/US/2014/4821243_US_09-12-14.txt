( what 's that ? the song is actually about teenage angst ? oh , maybe that 's why . ) i do n't want these factors to derail my resolution . to find out why running feels so sucky ( and hopefully make it suck less ) , i called steven magness , coach to several olympians and the university of houston cross country team , and author of the book the science of running .  the seven-step itch  i do n't want to totally shock my system once january 1st comes around , so i 'm going to prepare myself with short jogs before new year 's . complaints flooded in from every part of my body . the first came from my skin . i had n't made it to the end of my block before my chest started itching . it was like someone had stuffed my shirt full of wood chips . what 's actually happening , says magness , is blood flowing into tiny unused capillaries in my skin . in non-runners like me , these capillaries are dormant . when they get flooded with blood irregularly , they swell . this irritates nearby nerve endings , which sends itchy sensations to the brain .  burning muscles  not long after this , a familiar fire started burning inside my leg muscles . magness assured me that even top runners feel the burn . it 's caused by a buildup of lactic acid , but is really a signal your muscle is using to let your brain know it 's running out of energy . " pain is feedback for your brain to let you know how hard you 're working , " magness said . thing is , this pain signal typically comes , and eventually the burn will simmer down , says magness . eventually , you 'll build up enough endurance that your muscles wo n't freak out so soon .  side stitches  not long after i pushed through the burning in my legs , i was assaulted by side cramps . like a big , invisible hand had grabbed the side of my belly , i doubled over and immediately started walking with my hands on top of my head . the pain subsided , but left me wondering where it came from to begin with . for a while , says magness , researchers thought was that side stitches would come from the body getting low on electrolytes like sodium and potassium . but , studies showed that electrolyte-depleted athletes are no more prone to side cramps as those drinking healthy amounts of gatorade .  currently , says magness , there are two prevailing hypotheses . the first is that running causes you to strain a ligament connecting your diaphragm to the abdominal muscles . " when you 're running , your diaphragm is working harder than is also tied to the abdominal muscles , but has to do with a decrease in calcium , which can prevent muscles from relaxing .  gasping for air  not long after my legs started burning , the fire spread to my lungs and i began gasping for air . this happens , says magness , because our bodies are n't perfect at cycling co2 out of our lungs . " you are breathing so intensely that you ca n't get all of the bad air out , " magness said . even when you 're breathing normally , there 's never a perfect exchange of oxygen to carbon . with running , your muscles get so starved for air that they do n't leave you time to exhale completely . eventually you build up such a huge deficit that you get a burning sensation similar to holding your breath . " at this point , you stop , and bend over , and suck in , and you can finally catch up , " magness said .  " bubbleguts "  i had planned a two-mile run , i 'd catch my breath while looking at beautiful san francisco , then return . i did n't make it so far because my tummy started burbling before i was close to the first sloping street . i ended up speed walking the last few blocks home . " this is pretty common , " magness graciously told me . many runners also get gassy because their bodies are breaking down energy ( in the form of sugary carbohydrates , solid proteins , or rich fats ) , causing muscles cells to release gas . a lot of this gas ends up not making it to the lungs , where it can be expired without embarrassment . as magness tactfully put it : " gas gets stuck in places where it should n't be , and you got ta get it out some way . " also , he says , the mechanical jarring of running helps along the digestion process .  magness says these problems are most common with beginning runners , but even the olympians he coaches admit to suffering . so maybe i was n't born to alone in my misery . maybe one day i can catch up to the pros , and take my complaining to a whole new level .
