<h> 7 traits of people who are great at relationships <h> Relating to your partner , spouse or significant other can be challenging . Here 's what the people who make it work know that you may not . <p> Most people in healthy relationships share a few key traits . ( Photo : Blend Images/Shutterstock ) <p> By now , I hope that everyone has gotten the message that relationships are n't easy . If you expect that having a close , loving bond with another human being over the span of months or years is going to be all pretty relfies ( that 's a relationship selfie ) and sunshine , you will be hugely disappointed . <p> But a great romantic relationship , while needing care and feeding ( from both parties ) , should also be fun and joyful -- if it 's a drag to be with your beloved all the time , something 's wrong . Like many other things in life , some people are better at relationships than others . How do they do it ? Most of them share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accept their partners for who they are : Yes , people can change , but not all that much . So if you are constantly trying to motivate your spouse to do something small that they do n't want to do , like exercise more , or quit smoking , or be more assertive about their needs at work , that 's awesome , because that 's the kind of work partners should do for each other . Supporting each other in what we want to do in life is a beautiful thing . But the wholesale changing someone who , say , likes to surf more than she likes to work into a career-focused individual , trying to make a city guy into a country-living fan , or convincing someone who does n't want kids that they should have them is dangerous , and you 're bound to be disappointed when -- shocker -- they continue to be themselves . You can help your partner change small things about who they are , but if you are n't into a major aspect of someone 's personality , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't skimp on the snuggling : Like most mammals , human beings have a strong desire to be held and touched by the people closest to us -- regular physical connections are incredibly important , and that 's proven by science . According to a Psychology Today essay on the literature about affection and happiness , " There was no connection between the amount of physical affection and amount of conflict for a couple , but cuddling/holding , kissing on the lips , and hugging were all associated with how easily the couple resolves the conflict they do experience . " <p> They really listen : Cultivating good listening skills is good for all kinds of relationships , from those with your siblings and parents to those with your friends . But so many people tune their spouses out -- the very people who need and deserve your focused attention . What 's a greater act of love than really taking the time to listen to what someone you love has to say ? <p> They do n't expect their partner to " make them happy " : Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do from the inside . Of course , you can ask for love and support from your partner to achieve goals that will make you happier , like request daily meditation time , or time off for a retreat , or whatever else you need to get to a happier place , but you are the only one ultimately responsible for your happiness . <p> They are generous : Being giving is a daily way to show love for your partner ; that does n't have to mean buying presents or expensive jewelry -- it does mean giving them the bigger slice of pie , bringing them a cup of tea , or rubbing their shoulders when they are stressed . Regular generosity shows your partner they are loved , in a small , quiet ways . <p> They talk it out -- and keep talking : Everyone always says " honest communication is key " -- but few do the work to make that a reality . Having fights or disagreements is natural and healthy . It 's what you do after them that matters . Talk it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really feel ) and listen closely . Keep going . Keep listening . Then keep talking , until whatever it is that made you angry or sad is past , and you are actually talking and listening about the deeper issues that got you fired up to begin with . This is real work ; it is hard , but it is incredibly rewarding , bringing you closer to your partner and bringing a greater understanding of yourself and them . <p> They are genuine : It 's easy to start a relationship based on a shiny-happy-perfect version of who you are ( who would n't be attracted to that ? ) . But it 's dishonest , and over the long term , you will have to keep up the facade ( not healthy , and exhausting ! ) . Or you will eventually show your true colors and have to renegotiate the relationship from the new perspective . Be yourself from the beginning and everyone will know what they are getting into . Yes , some people might not like you , and that 's really OK . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are theirs alone , and do not reflect the opinions of MNN.com .
