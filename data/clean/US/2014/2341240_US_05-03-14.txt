<h> Favorite Schools <h> Favorite Teams <h> Kelly Blazek returns her 2013 Communicator of the Year Award after social media backlash <p> Screen Shot 2014-03-05 at 7.59.49 AM.png <p> Stories about Kelly Blazek and Diana Mekota , including this opinion piece from CNN.com , generated wide discussion on news sites and across the Internet about networking protocol and social media . The backlash also prompted the Cleveland Chapter of the International Association of Business Communicators to revoke Blazek 's 2013 Communicator of the Year Award . ( Screen grab from CNN.com ) <h> Earlier Plain Dealer stories : <p> The chapter 's website has now replaced its story about Blazek winning the award with a statement saying : " The IABC Cleveland Chapter board of directors and Kelly Blazek have mutually agreed that she will return the chapter 's 2013 Communicator of the Year award . The decision was made in the best interest of IABC , its members , and its mission . " <p> " Ms. Blazek , who is not an IABC member , agrees she will not use the Communicator of the Year designation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Cleveland chapter . " It continues , " IABC remains committed to providing professional communicators with the very best in content , community and professional-development opportunities . " <p> Blazek , who has pulled down her Twitter and LinkedIn accounts and erased her blog , could not be reached for comment Wednesday . <p> Blazek had a long-standing policy of not accepting invitations from those she does not personally know . But when Mekota and others went public with Blazek 's emails denying their requests to connect , Cleveland 's close-knit marketing communications committee expressed outrage and concern that Blazek 's email would reflect badly on Cleveland and discourage Millennials from moving here . <p> IABC Cleveland named Blazek its Communicator of the Year for her hobby of compiling job openings in the marketing , public relations , digital communications , media , journalism , graphics , and nonprofit management positions throughout Northeast Ohio . She distributed her Cleveland Job Bank listserv to more than 7,300 subscribers . <p> " Blazek is not just a headhunter or a recruiter , but a senior communications executive who enjoys helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement announcing the award . It noted that " her listserv is one of the largest individually produced employment compilations in the country within the marketing and communications field . " <p> " I 've always been a passionate advocate for keeping talent in NE Ohio , and we have so much of it in the region , " Blazek was quoted as telling attendees at the IABC recognition event . " I want my subscribers to feel like everyone is my little sister or brother , and I 'm looking out for them . " <p> But even though the sentiment on social media widely favored Mekota , others pointed out that the vicious reaction to Blazek overshadowed what she had done . <p> " I stand four square in support of Kelly Blazek , " said Terry Novak , a local consultant in marketing and sales . " She has been selfless in her efforts to help people in the sales/marketing , PR , and media fields find leads for jobs in Northeast Ohio for a long time . She tells the truth and gets excoriated ... go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an award from the PR Association and the Sales and Marketing Association for assisting and giving a boost to job seekers , " he added . <p> " I spent almost 30 years working in the media industry , some time with advertising agencies , but mostly in the magazine publishing industries . I also worked in the Human Resources field , both public and private , so I kind of know how important it is to have a source like Kelly Blazek when looking for a new position , " Novak said . " Kelly may have taken a wrong step in her answer to one or two of her plaintiffs , but her overall assistance to many folks ca n't be denied . " <p> Nevertheless , parody Twitter accounts sprouted up , including " Krabby Blazek " ( @KrabbyB ) and " The Other NEO Job Bank " ( @OtherNEOJobBank ) , with the tagline : " Oh wait , there is one . And it 's run by a couple of millennials . " <p> At least one person tried to create a fake LinkedIn account as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using catch-phrases from her rejection emails . <p> " Fake and/or parody accounts are a breach of our user agreement , " said Doug Madey , corporate communications manager for LinkedIn , via email . " When we become aware of them , we take appropriate action . In this specific case , the account you referenced in your note has been removed . " <p> Another Kelly Blazek in Wisconsin has added the following line under her LinkedIn profile : " Please note that I am not the same Kelly Blazek in the news who ran the Cleveland Job Bank .
