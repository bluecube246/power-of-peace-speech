got a hot tip ? tell us about it !  startup pitch : winerist gets a sip of funding for its wine and culinary tours website  winerist is a booking platform for travelers that focuses on wine and food travel .  based in london , the startup says that in april it secured a " sizeable " but unspecified seed round that came from undisclosed angel investors , including one of the founders of booking.com .  rolled out as a booking tool in march 2013 by school friends originally from moldova , diana isac ( ceo ) and tatiana livesey ( cfo ) , winerist is currently working on improving its booking solution and hiring engineers .  winerist has a commission based model from its tours , hotels and wineries around the world .  our strategy is to be present in every single major wine &amp; culinary spot and offer clients a simple online booking solution , especially since our recent survey shows that 55% book last minute or at the destination .  winerist is currently undergoing integration with booking.com  this will ensure that by the end of the year , the platform will grow to more than 5,000 experiences and places to stay in wine destinations and wine capitals around the globe .  what problem does the business solve ?  in a fragmented market , winerist brings the most authentic industry players online making wine and food travel simple .  what makes winerist stand out is its community of over 100 wine experts and bloggers worldwide . we pride ourselves in offering free travel guides , recommendations , and a booking service specifically for wine country .  travellers will never again have to spend endless hours researching and booking their perfect trip as winerist allows you to research and book it all in one place .  how did the initial idea evolve and were there changes/any pivots along the way in the early stages ?  we started off with wine travel , hence the name winerist ( wine tourist ) and quickly realised that wine &amp; food go together as an experience . people do not need to travel necessarily to enjoy great urban spots too .  since we started to generate revenues a year ago , we did a survey of users that showed that 75% of people book online and 34% use social media , while more than half book at the destination .  we 'll use these insights into customer behaviour to improve our product .  why should people or companies use the business ?  winerist is the best online tool to find , inform yourself and book that perfect wine and food holiday .  our free travel guides are written in cooperation with local wine and travel experts and provide tripadvisor-style information on where to go , what do to and where to eat for example .  unless you are going to napa , bordeaux or tuscany it 's very hard to come by a good travel guide for a wine &amp; foodie destination plus book the best experiences and hotel online .  what is the strategy for raising awareness and the customer/user acquisition ( apart from pr ) ?  winerist has focused on customer acquisition via channels such as wine clubs agents , a constant flow of high quality content generation , an on-going blogger outreach strategy and a targeted social media strategy .  where do you see the company in three years time and what specific challenges do you anticipate having to overcome ?  we want winerist to become the go to website for all wine and food experiences including in major cities .  we want to grow our community to over 100,000 users and become the largest online marketplace for winos &amp; foodies .  one of our main challenges ( hence , opportunity ) will be to educate the wineries how to set the wine tasting tours that the travellers are seeking .  the discerning tourist does not want to see a video of how wine is made when at the winery , they want to meet the winemaker , see the vines and of course taste the wines .  what is wrong with the travel , tourism and hospitality industry that requires another startup to help it out ?  the travel industry looks at the big picture , but right now it experience that 's right for him .  this is why we feel that a niche business that caters for the needs of wine-lovers and foodies at a global scale will help out many travellers looking for authentic experiences .  what other technology company would you consider yourselves most closely aligned to in terms of culture and style ... and why ?  probably peek or vayable , because they trying to connect the locals with traveller and focus more on unique tours .  sean o'neill is editor-in-chief of tnooz . he lives in new jersey . before joining us , sean was tech columnist at bbc travel , senior editor at budgettravel.com , and associate editor at kiplinger 's . follow him on twitter .  very interesting and informative start-up pitch . there is one more start-up website in this space across the pond in toronto canada . i am the founder of wine region rentals a one stop wine &amp; travel lovers portal to link wine and travel lovers with lodging and tours in wine regions . the travellers visiting the website are able to book through affiliates like viator , homeway , booking.com , etc as well as tours .
