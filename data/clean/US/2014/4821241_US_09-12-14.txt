the newest revelation sheds light on the finer details of the rise of the tomb raider 's timed exclusivity deal for xbox one , but also poses questions about how future ports to other systems will be handled .  microsoft 's agreement to act as publisher likely means it will handle marketing and distribution costs ; which possibly could be a responsibility it has taken to help broker the exclusivity deal in the first place .  the deal also suggests how deep the agreement between the two companies has become , as well as how much of the publishing costs microsoft is willing to shoulder in order to seal an exclusivity agreement . that also , in turn , suggests how far into the future the exclusivity period could last .  currently , both microsoft and square enix are only saying the rise of the tomb raider is a " holiday 2015 " exclusive .  a representative for square enix has told gamespot that microsoft is providing support across the entire development and publishing pipeline for rise of the tomb raider . the for a playstation 4 version .  " microsoft has always seen huge potential in tomb raider and they will get behind this game with more support across development , marketing and retail than ever before , which we believe will be a step in continuing to build the tomb raider franchise as one of the biggest in gaming .
