<h> The VICE Channels <h> Trolling the Unheard Depths of Spotify with Forgotify <p> Written by <h> Thor Benson <p> February 1 , 2014 // 04:20 PM EST <p> Copy This URL <h> Image : Romanovsky &amp; Phillips/Valarie Santagto <p> The founders of Forgotify are embarking on a project that , if successful , is doomed to self-destruct . Their Spotify-based program plays you the songs on the music streaming site that have never been listened to ... ever . That 's it . " There was an article floating around early last December that mentioned the crazy stat that four million songs had n't even been listened to . Co-founder Lane Jordan found it and sent it my way with the seeds of the idea , " fellow co-founder Nate Gagnon told me . <p> Jordan discovered that 20 percent of Spotify 's library had never been heard -- not even once . He brought on his friends J. Hausmann and Nate Gagnon to help with a project that would put a spotlight on those unsung heroes of music . Forgotify scans Spotify 's API for songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library to be heard . The rest is up to curious listeners . <p> The first song I heard when I loaded up Forgotify was " Trouble in Paradise " by Romanovsky &amp; Phillips . The song starts , " This is the story of two gay lovers . " Needless to say , the songs people will encounter when loading up Forgotify will be obscure and often times ridiculous . The song that followed Romanovsky &amp; Phillips was a Czech lute gospel of sorts . <p> A lot of the music one will find when experiencing Forgotify is older -- at least a couple decades old . It make sense . Most newer music at least gets a few plays from friends of the bands , or the bands themselves . So Forgotify is mostly an ode to the lost songs of aspiring bands and ensembles of the past . <p> The temporal beauty of Forgotify is its fleeting existence . " If it 's successful , it shuts itself down , " Gagnon said . " We heard somewhere that it would take 200,000 people listening for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs -- which makes it sound more attainable than we thought . " At the very least that lute gospel song and the Romanovsky &amp; Phillips number have exited the Forgotify realm . <p> The people behind Forgotify are an ensemble of artists themselves . Graphic design , app development , and copywriting are among the group 's collective skill sets . Gagnon told me he 's working on a project to " launch a big anti-violence project in Chicago over the next few months . " He also noted that he did n't get invested in the project because of being part of an unknown music group , like those he helps expose .
