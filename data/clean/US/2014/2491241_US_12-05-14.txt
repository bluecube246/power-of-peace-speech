scales of justice  how a terrible supreme court decision about player pianos made the cover song what it is today .  the player piano deeply troubled composers at the time of its introduction .  courtesy of rama/mus ? e baud  way before spotify , stereos , or even radio , americans who wanted to listen to music at home had one choice : they could play it themselves . this changed by the 1890s , when a hot new technology arrived : the player piano . player pianos were miraculous in their ability to play popular songs and old standards alike while people sang along , danced , or just enjoyed the sounds . but as with a lot of newfangled machines , not everyone loved the player piano .  in particular , the technology deeply troubled composers , such as the famed john philip sousa . sousa worried that the pianos would kill the public 's demand for sheet music , and copyright royalties from the sale of sheet music were what paid composers ' bills . to make matters worse the songs they put on piano rolls -- scrolls of paper with holes punched out in patterns . people could n't read the rolls ; they spoke only to machines . and on that ground , the player piano companies argued that the rolls did not " copy " songs , and so could be manufactured and distributed without the need to pay royalties .  this was an exceptionally stupid argument . sheet music and player piano rolls both copy songs ; they just use different languages . what matters is what comes out when the language is translated . and for both , the answer is the same : music .  advertisement  so the issue was n't terribly difficult , but apparently it was complicated enough to fool the supreme court . in a 1908 case called white-smith music publishing co. v. apollo co. , the supreme court sided with the player piano companies . the court said that because humans could n't read player piano rolls , they were not in fact copies , and as a result , composers like sousa could n't demand any will innovate if others can copy freely . why invest the time to invent a better mousetrap , or write a great song , if someone can just take the fruit of your hard work and sell it themselves ? this basic logic -- that copying is bad for creativity -- is the fundamental reason we have patent and copyright law . these rules exist to make sure that copying is only legal when the creator agrees to it . unauthorized copying -- as anyone who has watched a dvd with an fbi warning at the start knows -- is against the law .  so when , more than a century ago , the supreme court declared that copying by player piano companies was just fine , we saw the beginning of a process that culminated in the death of american songwriting . songwriters stopped writing , fearful that the piano roll companies would just steal their new songs and feed the expanding market for player pianos at home . thanks to the supreme court , the golden age of american song essentially ended in 1908 .  in creating had no idea it would let loose one of the great innovative forces in music .  if something seems wrong about this story , it 's because the last part is completely false . as we all know , the golden age of american songwriting did not end in 1908 . in fact , geniuses such as george gershwin and cole porter were still kids when white-smith publishing was decided . nearly all the " great american standards " were written in the decades after white-smith publishing . the reason american songwriting not only survived the onslaught of the player piano , but thrived , tells us a lot about how creativity really works .  the first important thing to know is that the actual result in white-smith publishing lasted but a year before it was overturned by congress . the copyright act of 1909 extended the law to cover all " mechanical " reproductions of songs , whether read by people or machines . at the same time , however , congress did a very important thing : it mandated that all songs would be subject to what that any musician could copy another 's song without asking permission , so long as they paid a low standardized fee to the songwriter ( $0.02 per copy , originally , and quite a bit lower , adjusted for inflation , today ) . so on the one hand , congress overthrew the argument that player piano rolls were not songs . but on the other , congress set everyone free to copy , just so long as a small fee was paid .  so why did congress create this unusual system of legal copying ? because it was afraid of one company -- aeolian . that firm is long gone . but in the early part of the 20th century , congress viewed aeolian as something like the microsoft or google of the nascent player piano market .  anticipating that congress would overturn white-smith publishing , aeolian swiftly bought up song rights from musicians and publishing companies so it could copy them onto player piano rolls . aeolian 's weaker competitors complained to congress about this attempt to corner the music market .  an automatic piano roll so to keep the aeolian co. from having a monopoly on the then-crucial player piano roll market , congress allowed anyone to make a mechanical reproduction of someone else 's song . and that does n't just mean that aeolian 's competitors could make their own piano rolls of popular tunes . congress 's compulsory licensing scheme legalized the cover song -- anyone can make their own recording of someone else 's song , just so long as a recording of that song has previously been released , and the cover artist pays the required fee . ( in practice , most cover artists pay privately negotiated rates that are even lower than the fee set by congress ) . and the freedom to cover others ' songs gave birth to a vibrant culture of continuous musical revival , remaking and reinterpretation , all of which allows good songs to become great and , sometimes , we must admit , classics to be butchered .  it 's all in the eye ( or ear ) of the beholder . but the important point is that because of aeolian 's dominance in america in which musicians are free to tweak songs they like -- and they do so with great enthusiasm . bob dylan wrote " all along the watchtower " ; jimi hendrix turned it into something quite different and , arguably , made a great song even greater . another 1960s classic , van morrison 's " gloria , " has been covered by performers including jimi hendrix , the doors , david bowie , tom petty , bruce springsteen , rickie lee jones , ac/dc , and ( in perhaps the song 's most memorable and inventive reinterpretation ) patti smith . " gloria " is an enduring song in part because so many legendary musicians have tweaked it . cat power , john lennon , willie nelson , paul anka , and many other famous artists have issued albums of nothing but cover songs . all this legal copying has made our musical culture immeasurably richer .  has the freedom to copy others ' songs , in exchange for a very low fee that the original songwriter has no power to override , suppressed the incentive to . indeed , the opposite is true . every day we see a continual outpouring of new songs . and many of the copied songs -- the covers -- are themselves incredibly creative . think about jazz greats like charlie parker and john coltrane . on one level , they are copying -- coltrane 's version of the rodgers and hammerstein standard " my favorite things " relies on that song 's famous melody . but if coltrane starts there , it 's certainly not where he ends up . by the song 's end , more than 13 minutes later , coltrane has altered the original melody and taken it in a much darker , more contemplative direction . at some point in the song , coltrane crosses the uncertain border that separates copyists from creators .  this kind of creative copying -- what we will call " tweaking " -- is not just a musical thing . it is present in all inventive fields . perhaps the most important point about tweaking is this : tweaking does not appear to lead to fewer original creations . if anything most significant and enduring innovations rest on tweaking . as malcolm gladwell has argued , the late steve jobs of apple -- an icon of our innovation economy if there ever was one , and the man behind the iphone and ipad -- " was repeatedly referred to as a large-scale visionary and inventor . " but in fact , " he was much more a tweaker . "  jobs , gladwell goes on to argue , was " the greatest tweaker of his generation . " even the ipad , jobs ' last great success , was a tweak of an idea out of microsoft . and gladwell rightly points out that the significance of tweaking to technological innovation is by no means a new thing : economists debating the origins of the industrial revolution have claimed that the key reason britain , and not france or germany , was the first home of the industrial age was tweaking . as gladwell describes their argument , britain was not necessarily the home of path-breaking pioneers who created the foundational building blocks of the industrial revolution . rather :  larger population of skilled engineers and artisans than its competitors : resourceful and creative men who took the signature inventions of the industrial age and tweaked them -- refined and perfected them , and made them work .  in creating the cover song , the congress of a century ago had no idea it would let loose one of the great innovative forces in music . it was just trying to repair a blunder by the supreme court and ensure that the giant aeolian co. did n't swallow the entire player piano market . today , the player piano market is minuscule , and aeolian has been dead for almost three decades . but the lesson of aeolian lives on . copying and creativity are not opposites -- they are often complements . since there is nothing new under the sun , every creator relies , sometimes to a large degree , on what came before .  this should be obvious , but too often it is n't . copying is viewed as a terrible thing , a crime and a killer of creativity . to be sure , story shows , it can also be the key to new forms of creativity we never could have imagined .
