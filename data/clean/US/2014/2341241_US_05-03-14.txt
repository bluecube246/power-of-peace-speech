to understand why , we have to start in 2008 . the decision of whether or not to allow internet providers to favor some forms of traffic over others -- also known as net neutrality -- was beginning to bubble up in washington . some providers started blocking forms of web traffic -- it 's the best they can do to deal with the insane demand for transfers they get in those peak hours of 7 p.m. to 11 p.m .  " the rationale was that ( all the traffic ) was degrading the combined experience of all their users and therefore this was justified , " klinker says , " and that struck at the core of an open internet . "  eric klinker  bittorrent was a rock between several hard places : the internet providers , the lawmakers , and the users hungry for download speeds . but they did n't have the conventional resources for getting things done in washington . they only had 23 employees . they had no government affairs office , no avenue for lobbying legislation . but game , who were asking themselves a few important questions :  what if there was a way to solve the traffic jam without legislation ?  and what if the solution were a technological one ?  that solution was the micro transport protocol -- a new way of organizing the internet traffic .  micro transport protocol , or utp for short , is a way of allowing traffic to re-arrange itself so things do n't get so jam-packed . it 's like when you hack your commute by working for a few hours from home before taking to the bumper-to-bumper freeway or cheek-to-jowl subway : you wait to make your move until the coaster is clearer . rather than having bittorrent shoulder more of its way into bandwidth during peak hours , utp re-arranges to a later time .  this stands in contrast to tcp/ip , an older , less agile protocol . when you 're on tcp/ip , the network hums along until a data starts failing to reach its destination . only then does it signal that the internet connection is congested .  " waiting to slow down until you 've hit your first pedestrian , " klinker says . " at the end of the day , tcp is n't a particularly intelligent method ; it 's designed to see damage on the traffic and then get out of the way . utp is designed to sense that damage is about to happen and then get out of the way . "  let 's say you get home from work and want to watch house of cards on netflix or call your cousin on skype . under utp , any bittorrent transfers you have going on in the background will politely wait for your streaming to be finished before they jump in . then , in the uncrowded hours of the late night , utp lets your torrenting get going , soaking up all that suddenly spare bandwidth . now that utp is used for 80% of bittorrent transfers , traffic no longer peaks in that 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. time slot . this is also why the monthly userbase has grown from 60 million in 2008 to 170 million today -- down .  to klinker , the utp is a win-win-win . it 's allowed bittorrent to get even bigger while lessening its presence at peak hours . it 's a win for internet providers because they get more value from the existing investment of their network . it 's a win for users because they do n't want their downloads and uploads crowding into crowded hours .  together , utp feels like a lesson for the ongoing net neutrality debate .  " it 's the best example we have of technology being used to solve what is perceived to be a policy problem , " klinker says . " especially in the light of the internet as a global phenomenon , there 's no single regulatory body for the internet and hopefully there wo n't be . it 's only through the technology that the internet 's rules are written .
