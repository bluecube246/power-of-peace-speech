<p> Joe Songer / Birmingham NewsGov . Robert Bentley , second from right , visits Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church shortly after his inauguration Monday . He gave his first speech after his inaugural address from the pulpit used by Dr. Martin Luther King during his tenure at the church . <p> Speaking from the pulpit of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church , the congregation Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . pastored during the stormy days of Civil Rights struggles in Montgomery , Bentley said , " anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior , I 'm telling you , you 're not my brother and you 're not my sister , and I want to be your brother . " <p> Bentley 's communications director , Rebekah Caldwell Mason , later said that the governor had intended no offense by his remarks . <p> " He is the governor of all the people , Christians , non-christians alike , " she said , using language that echoed phrases of Bentley 's inaugural address . <p> However , his remarks have offended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish people and empowering equal treatment for all , today issued a stern condemnation of Bentley 's statement . <p> " It is shocking that Governor Bentley would suggest that non-Christians are not worthy of the same love and respect he professes to have for the Christian community , " said ADL Southeast Regional Director Bill Nigut . " His comments are not only offensive , but also raise serious questions as to whether non-Christians can expect to receive equal treatment during his tenure as governor . " <p> The Rev. Dr. David Freeman , senior pastor of Huntsville 's Weatherly Heights Baptist Church and chairman of the Leadership Council for the city 's Interfaith Mission Service , reacted not with shock but something more like sorrow . <p> " Gov . Bentley was using ' insider ' language , " Freeman said . " People in his church knew exactly what he meant . I grew up with that language , so I understand it , too . However , I now believe that that language points to one of the great failures of fundamentalist Christian theology . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings as our sisters and brothers . That is a gift the world 's faiths. "
