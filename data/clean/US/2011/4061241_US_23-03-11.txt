<h> Gadgets for the ghosthunter <p> In a survey conducted by CBS News in 2005 , it was found that 48 percent of Americans believed in ghosts . Other surveys have put the number at anywhere from around 20 to over 50 percent . While such figures certainly do n't imply that ghosts are real , they do suggest that belief in them is relatively common . When someone does suspect that a ghost is present in their home or business , they will sometimes call in " experts " to ascertain if that is , in fact , the case ... and what sort of gear do these ghost hunters use to detect said spirits ? We decided to find out . <p> Given that ghosts are frequently thought of as non-physical beings that can only be seen by people like Jennifer Love Hewitt or Haley Joel Osment , one might wonder how regular human technology could possibly register their presence . We 're told that it all comes down to what people are made of . <p> " We 're built out of energy -- atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonprofit Paranormal Explorers ghost-hunting group , which operates out of Edmonton , Canada . " I just think it 's an internal piece of us that stays when our bodies deteriorate . " <p> " When somebody dies , do they go into another dimension , with a very thin wall ? " asks her partner , Ben Myckan . " I think that 's sort of what it is . You ca n't destroy energy , it 's just in a different dimension . " <p> So apparently , it 's not so much about looking for lost souls as it is looking for unexplained energy , or evidence of its manipulation . <h> EMF meter <p> When it comes to detecting energy , an electromagnetic field meter is definitely a good tool to have . " At a haunted location , erratic and fluctuating EMF levels are likely to occur , " says Alexandra Woodfield , of UK-based paranormal gear retailer TomsGadgets . " Out of all the paranormal tools , the EMF meter is an excellent introduction to ghost detecting . Although currently there is no device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EMF meter is the closest tool on the market . " <p> Rona and Ben use their EMF meters partially to identify man-made electrical fields within buildings , as some researchers have suggested that supposed ghost sightings could be caused by such fields interacting with the human brain . The couple are also interested in detecting EMFs in places where no electrical features are present , however , as those could be caused by ... well , you know . <h> Thermometer <p> Anderson tells us that ghosts both gather energy from rooms and release it into them , causing highly localized drops or rises in temperatures -- hence the " cold spots " you might have heard mentioned in horror movies . A good thermometer will confirm that such perceived changes are n't just due to heebie-jeebies on the part of the observer , and will document exactly how large the changes are . " It has to be at least a ten-degree drop before we think , ' Oh , well maybe something 's happening in this room ' , " she explains . <p> Besides a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point-and-shoot model , that can instantly obtain temperature readings from any point that it 's aimed at within a room . <h> Digital audio recorder <p> Ghosts supposedly do sometimes want to talk to us , but not in a way that 's easy to understand in real time with the unaided human ear . Proponents of Electric Voice Phenomenon ( EVP ) tell us that if you record the room noise while asking questions aloud to the ghost , although you may hear nothing in response at the time , you 'll be able to make out some replies when you play back the audio file . If you 've heard EVP on any of the numerous paranormal reality TV shows , however , then you will know that a lot of those " replies " can be pretty faint and ambiguous . <p> Having to pick out the ghost 's end of a conversation after the fact kind of limits what you can talk about , but a new product offers a way around that limitation . Connecticut 's DAS Distribution makes a gizmo called the RT-EVP , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on a time delay -- that delay can be from 1 to 60 seconds , as set by the user . If you were to set the delay for five seconds , for instance , you would ask a question , then hear a recording of yourself asking the question , followed by an ongoing playback of whatever audio the device recorded in the room just five seconds ago . <p> Because it can pick up sounds down to 15Hz , which is below the threshold of human hearing , it can indeed " hear " things that we ca n't ... possibly even the voices of lost loved ones , according to product designer and DAS president Gary Galka . " Since the completion of the RT-EVP instrument , we have received three beautiful etheral messages from our daughter Melissa , " he tells us . <h> Ghost Box <p> While EVP can allegedly be found in ambient sound , it 's said to be easier for ghosts to work their voice messages into white noise , which is where something called the Ghost Box or Spirit Box comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly allowing ghosts to use stray bits of static , squeal and other noise to form and/or carry their messages . The RT-EVP , in fact , has a " frequency sweep " feature that lets it operate as a Ghost Box . <p> For her part , Anderson believes that Ghost Boxes have their place , but ca n't be relied upon . This is due to the simple fact that what is being heard could very likely just be distant radio broadcasts . " The only way you know is probably what they 're saying , " she says . " If they say ' Help me , ' or ' My name is Joan , ' you 're going , OK well that does n't sound like a radio station . " <p> A somewhat similar device is the Ovilus . It takes temperature and EMF readings , combines those readings into one number , chooses a word from an onboard database that matches up with that number , and then " speaks " the word aloud . The idea is that a ghost , knowing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will purposely make changes to the temperature and EMFs so that it can communicate through the Ovilus . Should you not want to shell out for the device itself , though , you can always download the iOvilus app to your iPhone . Just do n't believe everything it tells you ... <p> The Ovilus " works " on the same principle as Ouija boards , which many ghost-hunters steer clear of , as they are said to open up portals that anyone or anything could come through . " You 're not necessarily going to get who you think you 're going to get , " says Anderson , of the boards . " We 've had people who have called us to come and do an investigation because they 've used a Ouija board and someone 's dropped in and has n't left . " <p> In other words , go ahead and download iOvilus , but do n't blame us if you end up getting sucked into your TV . <h> Motion detector or beam barrier alarm <p> " These are also used for security by creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodfield . " Paranormal activity can trigger these beams and set off an alarm . Of course it is important to set up a digital video camera to eliminate tampering from other people or animals . " <p> Rona and Ben also use a Trail Master camera trap , in which a motion detector is wired directly to a digital still camera , which snaps a shot whenever the detector is tripped . The setup is commonly used in the wilderness by wildlife photographers , or even cryptozoologists looking for Bigfoot ... but that 's another article . <h> Infrared wireless cameras <p> When it comes to digital video cameras , Paranormal Explorers and most other groups use the infrared variety , running several of them into a split-screen display on a laptop . That way , they can show the client what their eyes might be missing , and make a DVD copy of the footage for them . Just what might that footage show ? <p> " Sometimes you might just see something floating around , " says Myckan . " You might see just a ball of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ectoplasm , and it might be in the shape of something . " <p> " Usually , when people watch it on TV , they really seem to have an epiphany , and they seem to be not frightened anymore , " adds Anderson . <p> Digital still cameras are also considered essential gear , both for showing up things that us humans ca n't see ( such as in Paranormal Explorers ' shot below , possibly ) , and simply for documenting locations where investigations are carried out . <p> It could be that one of the most useful things to have , however , is simply good " ghost sense . " <p> " When we go into a house that is supposed to be plagued by stuff , I do rely on my intuition , " says Anderson . " Usually I can pick up right away if there are spirits . " <p> So , is it possible that any of these instruments -- or even the human subconscious -- could be detecting anything from the great beyond ? We look forward to receiving your comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't cross the streams . " <p> Advertisement <p> About the Author <p> An experienced freelance writer , videographer and television producer , Ben 's interest in all forms of innovation is particularly fanatical when it comes to human-powered transportation , film-making gear , environmentally-friendly technologies and anything that 's designed to go underwater . He lives in Edmonton , Alberta , where he spends a lot of time going over the handlebars of his mountain bike , hanging out in off-leash parks , and wishing the Pacific Ocean was n't so far away . <p> There are no " ghost " outside of ones imagination , but there is something to be aware of . It is true " You ca n't destroy energy " - that is why when we die our life force goes out with our last breath and we return to the dust or elements we are made with . When we are cremated , we still end up as ashes or elements . The invisible realm does have living and powerful wicked spirit forces which take delight in misleading mankind . Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be destroyed ? The answers are easy to find . And peace of mind and a happy future is your reward by searching for the truth . <p> donwine24th March , 2011 @ 6:45 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> @Gizmag , this article is an incredible disappointment . I was really hoping that you 'd tear into these gadgets and expose them as the snake oil they are . For a media organization that loves all the techie details of things , I ca n't believe you accepted the legitimacy of this crap at face value without even asking twice how it worked . The people selling these " tools " are scam artists of the highest degree , and you are doing nothing except helping them scam more innocent , ignorant people . <p> chrismc24th March , 2011 @ 10:03 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> I would hope that the population demographic that takes the time to read this website would be smart enough to realize how absurd all of these gadgets are . <p> Every single one those useless gadgets was created based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creators fail to realize no one knows anything about ghosts ( because they do n't exists ) , therefor making tools based on what you think they are , usually based on traditional folklore , is silly and a waste of time . Starting from square one , considering no one knows anything about them , is the only rational option . <p> And if anyone thinks they do know anything about ghosts , or that they have proved they exist , please contact James Randi . He has a million big ones waiting for you . <p> TheRationalProphecy24th March , 2011 @ 10:33 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> What is going on in the American education system these days ? ? ? Over 40% of Americans think that the Theory of Evolution is false when it 's an established fact ! And now almost half of them believe in ghosts ? These guys are supposed to be world leaders but almost half of them are .... what 's the word I 'm looking for ? <p> warren52nz24th March , 2011 @ 2:38 p.m . ( California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; matter . So are all living organisms . Does that prove a one celled organism has a soul ? Or that a soul exists ? Or that it is eternal ? No , no , and no . As Tesla proved , energy is everywhere . Is it conscious ? Does it communicate ? No ! The burden of proof is on the ghost busters . A burden not met . <p> The proper response to ridiculous claims based on pseudo explanations is laughter , not a suspension of reason and a pretend scientific report . We have plenty of real mysteries that are infinitely more interesting and entertaining . <p> voluntaryist24th March , 2011 @ 3:08 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> I liked the article because it shows the gadgets , and HOW they sell them . The interesting thing is I find those gadgets very useful per se ... <p> cachurro24th March , 2011 @ 6 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> @ warren52nz : the THEORY of evolution is not the Established Fact of evolution it 's a THEORY . Darwin observed one species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One species has never been observed giving birth to any other species . If you believe man evolved from apes , why do we still have apes ? <p> Check out anything from Kent Hovind ( on YouTube ) . He 's a weird geeky guy that has a dry sense of humor but has a lot of good information . <p> Facebook User25th March , 2011 @ 4:06 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> warren52nz Just a quick FYI it 's still referred to as the the THEORY of evolution not the FACT of evolution . I 'm just say'n ...... : - ) <p> mrhuckfin25th March , 2011 @ 4:28 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> This is really scary stuff . I 'm naturally not afraid of the ghosts but the US citicens . Their votes generate a president with control over the most powerful military organisation in the world . <p> Conny S ? re25th March , 2011 @ 8:08 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> OMFG ! You people with these denigrating and ignorant comments ! 1 ) It 's a great article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work great for their intended application . 3 ) None of you can disprove the existence of ghosts . 4 ) None of YOU are experts in ANY field related to the use of these instruments . 5 ) Ghost are real . Not only have I seen many personally , but also have been involved in several scientific studies/experiments ( some will be published soon ) . 6 ) Nobody made any " Claims " about these products - Merely the observation that these items MAY and ARE being used for such applications as ' ghost hunting ' 7 ) Tesla did NOT disprove the existence of ghosts - In Fact .... his theories point TOWARD their existence . 8 ) You 're dumb . ... and senselessly mean . <p> Grant Garrison25th March , 2011 @ 10:03 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> I ca n't believe the comments posted here . <p> TheRationalProphecy- " every single one those useless gadgets was created based on ridiculous assumptions about the supposed behavior and compositions of ghosts . " <p> Lets take a look at these useless gadgets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electromagnetic fields , NOT ghosts . This meter has been around for a long time and is used in not only for people in the job field where one would deal with electricity , but also in the scientific field for research . They are also very useful for finding out if any of the electronic devices in you home have a high electromagnetic field . High electromagnetic fields could be harmful . <p> The thermometer : REALLY ? You did not know that this was invented for reading temperatures ? Not to mention that it is used on a daily basis by practically everyone ? Especially Doctors and hospitals . <p> The digital audio recorder : Also Has been around for a long time . It was created as a portable device for recording audio . Its very common for journalists and college students to use this . <p> Motion detector : These were created for security purposes . And used on a daily bases for home security against would be thieves and murderers . <p> Infrared wireless cameras : same as above . <p> Digital cameras : I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! ! ! Even the cell phone companies are in the ghost snake oil industry ! " Oh wait . The digital camera is just the next generation of camera . Invented for taking pictures of people , places and things . <p> The Ghost box : This is the ONLY one invented for the intentions of hearing ghosts . And if you have ever come across one they are clearly marked that it is for entertainment purposes only . As was ( and still is ) the Ouija board . <p> The other comments on here are not much better . I am very surprised that people who would read gizmag would not know of the existence of a thermometer for purposes other then ghost hunting . Truly amazing . <p> For those who have a fascination with what are commonly referred to as " ghost " - I have a question . It is easy to establish that creatures do exist in the invisible realm , so I will not try to discredit that . However , the same people who believe in them have no idea about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can anyone name a single contribution or benefit these wicket spirit forces have done to benefit mankind ? Put your beliefs to the test and you will see that they deal in the unknown , tragedies , dead , spells , mystery , fatalism and will do anything to misled mankind . Their biggest weapon is to fool people into believing they do not exists . What gadgets can combat that ? <p> donwine25th March , 2011 @ 6:08 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Actually , ' ghosts ' or spirit surviving death , has been proven under laboratory conditions . See the writings of Gary Schwartz , " Life After Death " <p> It was a very short time ago that a few visionaries were laughed at for proposing the existence of all sorts of things now known to be fact ; germs or virii , for instance . You certainly ca n't see them without a specific piece of equipment . Doubters should keep in mind that human knowledge is always advancing , and we 're still in the infancy of technological possibilities . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human condition ; the rest impede progress . <p> signalfire27th March , 2011 @ 9:20 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Nowadays , modern technology has given ghost hunters a wide range of equipment which is available to assist in their investigations . Tool kits of the ghost hunter from yesteryear often consisted solely of a notebook and pen , Polaroid camera , compass , candles , rolls of tape , and bits of string and wire . Common tools include :
