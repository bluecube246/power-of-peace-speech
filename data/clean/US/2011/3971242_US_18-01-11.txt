Local experts tout benefits of plant-based nutrition  Derrick deLay , a personal trainer at Northwest Personal Training in Vancouver , instructs Amanda Otto during her half-hour workout session . DeLay encourages people to shift to a plant-based diet for improved health .  They are writing a book together titled " Beyond Good " and they will share their philosophy in a presentation at Northwest Personal Training on Jan. 26 .  They are inspired by Dr. T. Colin Campbell 's " The China Study , " a book that argues a plant-based diet can prevent heart disease , diabetes and cancer . The gist of the book is captured in a new documentary , " Forks over Knives , " playing at Regal Fox Tower Stadium 10 in Portland through Thursday .  In working on their book , deLay and Ozgur are looking for people willing to be case studies . DeLay , who adheres to a vegan diet , will work with people willing to try completely giving up animal products . Ozgur will work with those willing to try her approach -- fish .  " Our clients ask , ' What about the protein ? ' " she said . " But you do n't need a lot of protein , especially in the form of animal protein . With that comes a lot of bad stuff . "  They have both seen clients suffer on the Atkins diet , which emphasizes meat and restricts carbohydrates . Those who lost weight simply dropped water , not fat , and had little energy for their workouts , deLay said .  Ozgur and deLay encourage people to change their approach .  " You did n't put it on overnight , and it 's not going to come off overnight , " Ozgur said . " We 're talking about not losing weight but gaining health . "  Here are some of Ozgur and deLay 's tips to achieve that goal :  * Try the 90-percent rule .  Ozgur recommends shooting for 90 percent of the food you consume to be plant foods . Cut animal products to one serving a day -- 1 cup of milk , 1 ounces of fish . As for treats , reserve them for special occasions . When you do indulge , it 's best to make your treats yourself so you know what 's in them . Ozgur does , however , give the green light to 1 ounce of dark chocolate , which is packed with antioxidants , a day .  * Think in terms of calorie density .  A pound of romaine has 100 calories , a pound of whole grains has about 500 calories , a pound of meat has between 700 and 1,000 calories , and a pound of nuts has 3,000 calories . Choosing foods with 500 to 600 calories a pound or less will lead to weight loss , deLay said . That also means avoiding processed foods , which are very calorie dense , he said .  * Accentuate the positive .  Do n't fixate on what you ca n't have , deLay said . " Instead of feeling like you 're going on a diet and depriving yourself , focus on the fact that you 're eating healthy , wonderful foods .  * Think long term .  " Do n't pick a diet you do n't intend to stay on forever , " Ozgur said . " We 're Americans and we like a quick fix . But you have to retrain your thinking : This is a lifestyle change . "  Black Bean Burgers  Makes 4-6 patties .  Alison Ozgur , a registered dietitian , and Derrick deLay , a certified personal trainer , both of Northwest Personal Training , emphasize that eating a plant-based diet can be enjoyable . Here is a recipe for healthful , vegan black bean burgers from Derrick deLay 's Web site , http : //www.vibrantvegan.com .

They are great served with salsa and a fresh green salad .  1/2 cup flour  1 small onion  2 cloves garlic , minced  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  1 small hot or jalapeno pepper , minced  1 tablespoon olive oil  1/2 medium red pepper , diced  2 cup corn niblets  1/2 cup bread crumbs  1/4 teaspoon cumin  1/2 teaspoon salt  2 teaspoons chili powder  2 tablespoons fresh parsley , minced ( optional )  On a small plate , set aside flour for coating .
