sylvester stallone accused of stealing another guy 's screenplay to make the expendables  despite the fact that everyone knows the expendables was synthesized by a supercomputer that stayed up really late watching hbo , a man named marcus webb is suing sylvester stallone for allegedly stealing his original script , the cordoba caper , which he says is " strikingly similar and in some places identical " to stallone 's action movie guys ' night out . webb claims that he first registered the cordoba caper as both a short story and a screenplay in 2006 before making it " widely available " to potential investors within the movie industry until 2009 .  within that time frame , webb contends that stallone and/or expendables co-writer david callahan must have seen it and lifted various elements from it for their movie -- including certain wholesale characters and plot points , such as the main story about a mission undertaken by a group of elite mercenaries to overthrow an evil latin american dictator named general garza , as well as an opening scene involving a hostage rescue main plot . " webb is seeking unspecified damages for copyright infringement as well as a court order preventing any further infringement in the upcoming sequel .  it 's not the first time stallone has been accused of plagiarism , of course : boxer chuck wepner famously sued stallone for failing to compensate him properly for dramatizing his life story to make rocky , a case that eventually settled out of court . and staying alive , obviously , was a total rip-off of charles dickens . anyway , while webb 's story does n't include a dozen aging former action stars doing the film equivalent of doing some really loud bench-pressing in front of all the young hotshots at gold 's gym , the rest is certainly condemning . stallone has yet to comment , but judging from his ( sadly abandoned ) twitter feed , if he did it would probably sound something like , " truth shadowboxes with itself in the desert , and the vultures come to pick the leftover bones . " or something .
