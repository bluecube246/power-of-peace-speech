problems of internal politics  angelica schwall-d ? ren is the minister for federal affairs , europe and media of north rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous state .  november 27 , 2011  french and german interests in the current crisis have been convergent for as long as their interest rates were more or less convergent . this is now changing , as investors are questioning france 's solvency and demanding higher rates . germany should strive to prevent even the most remote risk of a french downgrade , which would jeopardize the euro zone 's stability more than sovereign refinancing by the european central bank ever could . however , the german government is currently more concerned with its own domestic popularity and internal tensions , blind to the french president 's need for some success during a difficult electoral campaign and -- more regrettably -- blind to the economic and political needs of both the euro zone and the wider european union .  for germany , the role of the european central bank has become a question of principle rather than been differences between france and germany throughout the crisis -- most evident in the disputes over automatic sanctions , economic governance and eurobonds . this is nothing new : it has been the ability to bridge the differences between the two nations that historically characterised the franco-german tandem as the engine of european integration . however , the current situation is bringing this engine to its limits . while nicolas sarkozy 's chances of re-election are waning with the speculation over a downgrade , angela merkel risks a revolt within her own party should she agree to any measures that might impose costs on german taxpayers or diverge from german economic dogmatism , especially the mantra of central bank independence . from the beginning of this crisis , the involvement of the european central bank has been a sore point for germany . it has become a question of principle rather than a question of economic reasoning .  to outsiders this may be astonishing , considering the ramifications it may have . to cling to economic principles that predate monetary union and the evident market failures of the past years possible fallout of a french downgrade . but to discuss alternatives to germany 's central banking dogmatism is taboo for germany 's right , regardless of advice from nobel laureates and german economists .  merkel is primarily playing to her ( national ) audience , much in the same way that sarkozy is . this is , in other words , not a stand-off between nations but between schools of thought and political actors , guided by their needs . unfortunately , as is so often the case , the power to persist may be stronger on the side that is less needy : in other words , merkel is in a better negotiating position than sarkozy . one can only hope that she gives in to economic reason rather than to dogmatism.
