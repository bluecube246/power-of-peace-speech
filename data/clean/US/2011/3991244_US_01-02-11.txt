<h> UN study reveals state of world 's fisheries : Greenpeace has the solution <p> Yesterday , at an obscure United Nations meeting , some distressing news came from a gathering of policy-makers , scientists and diplomats in Rome . The Food and Agricultural Organisation is convening in Italy and yesterday put forward their most recent State of the World 's Fisheries and Aquaculture report . Unfortunately , the state of the world 's fisheries is pretty dismal . <p> In just ten years , the global trade in fish and fish products has nearly doubled in value . More than half ( 55% ) of fish product exports come from developing nations and are bound for plates in rich countries . <p> The proportion of fish stocks estimated to be healthy has declined from 40 percent in the mid-1970s to 15 percent in 2008 . <p> At the same time , the proportion of fish stocks that are in trouble increased from 10 percent in 1974 to 32 percent in 2008 . <p> The global demand for seafood is only going to increase , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can continue to sustain life on earth and feed the world 's people . <p> This FAO report confirms what we 've known to be true for years : that we 're simply running out of fish and that our oceans are already becoming exhausted . But- There is a way out ! There is an answer ! Oceans-saving marine reserves ! <p> Greenpeace 's proposed network of marine reserves covering 40% of the world 's oceans- the vision that can rescue our world 's seas . <p> Urgent action is needed to save the world 's oceans from collapse : to manage our oceans for the billions of people dependent on them for food , and the creation of a global network of marine reserves covering 40% of the world 's oceans . Governments must act now , by ending overfishing and illegal fishing , and by creating living oceans for the world 's people , for generations to come , and not just for the industrial fishing interests . <p> Some try and put forward aquaculture as the solution to the oceans crisis . However , the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforming the fishing and aquaculture industries and implementing a global network of marine reserves : both of which can restore fish populations and our oceans back to health . Fishing operations and communities alike in the developing world -- not just the rich countries ' fishing industries - must be ensured access to fish for survival . <p> Steve Smith works in the communications department at Greenpeace International , based in Amsterdam . <h> Post a comment <p> OPTIONAL : Sign in now and avoid filling in forms !
