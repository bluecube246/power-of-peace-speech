<h> Tags : <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , this is what a lender of last resort looks like . What you 're looking at here are three lines . The black line is Morgan Stanley 's market capitalization , which tends to hover in the $40 billion range but which fell as low as $9.8 billion in November 2008 . The orange line is the amount that Morgan Stanley owed to the Federal Reserve on any given day -- an amount which peaked at $107 billion on September 29 , 2008 . And the red line is the ratio between the two : Morgan Stanley 's debt to the Federal Reserve , expressed as a percentage of its market value . That ratio , it turns out , peaked at some point in October , at somewhere north of 750% . <p> Many congratulations are due to Bloomberg , for extracting this information from the Fed after a long and arduous fight . It could n't have come at a timelier moment : if the ECB wants to avert a liquidity crisis , charts like this give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , and how quickly it might have to act . <p> On September 16 , 2008 , Morgan Stanley owed $21.5 billion to the Fed . The next day , that number doubled , to $40.5 billion . And eight working days later , on the 29th , the bank 's total borrowings from the Fed reached $107 billion . The Fed did n't blink : it kept on lending , as much as it could , to any bank which needed the money , because , in a crisis , that 's its job . <p> The Fed likes to say that it was n't taking much if any credit risk here : that all its lending was fully collateralized , etc etc . But it 's really hard to look at that red line and have a huge amount of confidence that the Fed was always certain to get its money back . Still , this is what lenders of last resort do . And this is what the ECB is most emphatically not doing . I find it very hard to imagine the ECB lending some random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping liquidity flowing . <p> And it 's frankly ridiculous that it 's taken this long for this information to be made public . We 're now fully ten months past the point at which the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 's final report was published ; this data would have been extremely useful to them and to all of the rest of us trying to get a grip on what was going on at the height of the crisis . The Fed 's argument against publishing the data was that it " would create a stigma " , and make it less likely that banks would tap similar facilities in future . But I can assure you that at the height of the crisis , the last thing on Morgan Stanley 's mind was the worry that its borrowings might be made public three years later . When you need the money , and the Fed is throwing its windows wide open , you do n't look that kind of gift horse in the mouth . <p> Every time the Fed fights tooth and nail to prevent certain information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain feeling of anticlimax : we get the information , and ask what on earth is so dangerous about normal people knowing it . The Fed is one of the most vital and least trusted institutions in America , and there 's a reason why a book called End the Fed is still riding high in the Amazon charts , more than two years after it was published . If the Fed wants to get Americans back on its side -- and it needs to get Americans back on its side -- then it will have to stop fighting these silly battles against transparency . Especially since the release of this data has a lot to teach the Fed 's counterparts in Frankfurt .
