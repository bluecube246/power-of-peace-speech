by robert d. kaplanrobert d. kaplan is a senior fellow at the center for a new american security and the author of the revenge of geography : what the map tells us about coming conflicts and the battle against fate .  november 28 , 2011  fundamentally , the past year has been about grappling with the most profound question in political philosophy : how to create legitimate central authority . in one arab country after another -- tunisia , egypt , libya , yemen , syria -- populations have taken to the streets to demand the downfall of their rulers , even as it is unclear what will follow in their wake .  and the question applies not only to the arab world . it is unclear , for example , whether iran 's quasi-clerical system of revolutionary rule has a long-term future , given the intense infighting within the regime and the intense dislike it stirs within significant swaths of the population . can china 's one-party system of control last indefinitely ? can burma 's ? whereas the united states basically inherited drama over more than two centuries has been about limiting central authority , the challenge in too many other places is the opposite : how to erect responsive government in the first place .  no thinker has tackled these questions as painstakingly and as eloquently as the 19th-century english philosopher john stuart mill , which is why he is such an appropriate guide for these complicated times . mill asserts , in on liberty , and especially in considerations on representative government , that while democratic government is surely to be preferred in theory , it is incredibly problematic in its particulars . this , of course , is part of mill 's larger exploration of liberty , and why ultimately the only justification a government has to curtail that liberty is when a person 's behavior impinges on the rights of others . despotism may work better in some instances , if only as a temporary measure , he writes ; democracy is not suited for each and every society during significant periods of its development . i am crudely simplifying mill , who is so clear while being " progress includes order , " mill writes in considerations , " but order does not include progress . " tyranny may be the political building block of all human societies , but if they do n't get beyond tyranny , the result is moral chaos and stagnation . middle eastern despots of our day too often supplied only order ; asian ones have brought progress , too . thus china 's rulers , who must retire at a certain point , who bring technical expertise to their rule , and who govern in a collegial style , are much to be preferred over the north african variety , to say nothing of those in syria or yemen . yet even in those cases , the prospect of a collapse of central authority indicates that , pace mill , there may be no alternative to some sort of dictatorship , at least in the very short term .  mill 's philosophy actually builds on that of his 17th-century compatriot , thomas hobbes , another thinker all too relevant for our times . hobbes is often regarded as a preacher of . he stared into the abyss of anarchy and realized there was , indeed , a solution that could lead to order and progress . that solution was the state . hobbes extols the moral benefits of fear and sees violent anarchy as the chief threat to society . for hobbes -- best known for observing that the lives of men are " nasty , brutish , and short " -- fear of violent death is the cornerstone of enlightened self-interest . by establishing a state , men replace the fear of violent death with the fear that only those who break the law need face . so while hobbes made the case for central authority , mill built on him to help us understand how humanity must get beyond mere authority in order to erect a liberal regime .  such concepts are sometimes difficult to grasp for today 's urban middle class , which has long since lost any contact with man 's natural condition . but the horrific violence of a disintegrating iraq , or this year 's fears of state collapse in places such as yemen and 's original state . in fact , as more and more nondemocratic systems find it harder and harder to survive in this age of instant electronic communications , mill and hobbes will top the dead thinkers list for years to come . iraq , with its mixture of democracy , creeping authoritarianism , and anarchy , is a place made for mill and hobbes , while afghanistan is pure hobbes . imagine the relevance of hobbes in the event of a regime collapse in north korea ; or of mill as egypt struggles for years to transform a military dictatorship into a civil democracy . these men may be long dead , but their philosophy is a sure guide to today 's headlines . the need for order -- even as order must be made free from tyranny -- is precisely the issue that hangs over the greater middle east .
