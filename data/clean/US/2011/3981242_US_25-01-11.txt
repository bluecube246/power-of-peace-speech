STORY HIGHLIGHTS  Women who steal newborns do so to hold on to a faltering relationship , experts say  Typical perpetrator is not motivated by maternal instincts or a burning desire for motherhood  Such cases are rare -- but tragic for families involved  ( CNN ) -- In a case that captured much attention this week , a woman told investigators she abducted an infant from a New York hospital in 1987 , hoping to raise the child as her own after she 'd suffered multiple miscarriages .  Why would someone steal another person 's child ?  In these types of cases when a woman snatches a baby , the typical perpetrator is not motivated by maternal envy or a burning desire for motherhood . It 's usually her desire to hang on to a boyfriend or husband in a deteriorating relationship , experts said . baby .  " It sounds bizarre , " said Cathy Nahirny , a senior analyst on infant abduction cases at the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children . " It 's to hold on to the male partner . "  The reasoning may sound like a plot line from a soap opera , but the aftermath is tragic .  Such cases of baby abductions are extremely rare -- 271 cases in the U.S. have been reported since 1983 . About 4 million babies are born in this country every year .  Half of the abduction cases occurred in health care facilities , where a woman masquerading as a hospital employee walked off with a newborn -- much as Ann " Annugetta " Pettway confessed to doing at Harlem Hospital .  Pettway has admitted to taking 19-day-old Carlina Renae White in 1987 . White recently was reunited with her biological family .  On Sunday , Pettway turned herself in and told investigators that she had been unable to give birth , according to court papers filed Monday .  Pettway 's cousin told the New an attempt to hold on to her boyfriend . The New York Post was first to report the story .  Nahirny does not have firsthand knowledge of Pettway 's case and spoke about such cases in general .  In similar kidnappings , Nahirny said , the abductor often is a woman feeling trapped .  " Because she has already announced to her male partner that she 's pregnant , the relationship may be warming up , " said Nahirny , who has examined hundreds of similar cases . " She 's afraid to tell him she has had a miscarriage . She has it in her head that he 's going to leave . "  The phenomenon transcends race and socio-economic status . The woman is likely to be of childbearing age and often overweight , according to the infant abductor profile used by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children . The profiles were formed after examining traits and police reports .  " The person is of low-self esteem , who either had a baby or lost a baby , had some kind of " said Jeff Aldridge , the president of Security Assessments International , which advises hospitals about security procedures for nurseries .  The abducted child is usually well cared for , Aldridge said .  Infertility generally does not drive the crime , experts say .  " It 's not a matter of they 're not able to produce , " said John Rabun , executive vice president and chief operating officer of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children . Many of the women have given birth before and use that experience to feign another pregnancy . The issue for them is to produce a baby on cue , he said .  Once a woman lies to her boyfriend or husband about her pregnancy , she has to produce a child within that time frame .  " She 's not able to tell him that she miscarried . He 's going to leave her . She 's under a time pressure , " he said .  This means she can not take fertility treatments or adopt a child -- all of which take time . pregnant women and cut babies out of wombs , according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .  In 2009 , a Maryland woman attempted to cut a fetus out of a pregnant woman using a box cutter . In 2005 , a Pennsylvania woman beat her pregnant neighbor with a baseball bat and tried to cut her stomach to steal the baby .  " This is not psychiatric issue . They 're sane ; they decide to commit a criminal act . " Rabun said .  The fact that many women carefully prepare , watch for babies that have similar physical traits means " they know what they 're doing , " he said .  Nahirny agreed .  " I would say none of these abductors have psychotic breaks , " she said . " It 's too planned . "  They frequently visit the nursery and maternity units , asking the staff detailed questions about procedures and the maternity floor layout . They become familiar with the staff , their work routines and the victims ' parents .  " My out there , " Nahirny said .  They deceive their boyfriends or husbands about their pregnancies and manipulate themselves into position to abduct children , she said .  In jail interviews , the women expressed disappointment that they were caught .  " They focus on how awful this is and ' Can you believe it 's happening to me ? ' " Rabun said , calling the inmates narcissistic . " These women 's needs are above the community 's needs , above the natural parents . ' It 's one thing to steal a wallet -- but a newborn -- wow !
