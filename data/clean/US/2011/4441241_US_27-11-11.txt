a mine fire near city of carbondale vexed redevelopment project construction  a mine fire raging underground came " very close " to the place where officials hoped to cut it off . on feb. 9 , 1961 , carbondale mayor frank l. howard announced that an all-out push would , he hoped , stop the fire before it spread farther .  the stepped-up action came just nine days after a wayward blast showered the area with huge chunks of rock and brought a halt to efforts to contain the fire . the multimillion-dollar urban renewal project called for strip mines to contain the fire and then eradicate it . the fire had raged beneath the city 's west side for nearly 15 years in mines owned by the carbondale coal co. , a subsidiary of the glenn alden co .  the carbondale redevelopment authority had purchased 80 homes in the vast redevelopment area to make way for the project . strip-mining efforts had begun several weeks before the mayor 's announcement , starting near the a&amp;p supermarket on brooklyn street and proceeding toward west street . drag lines operated from the ground level . at the bottom of the pits , small power shovels and trucks removed the coal .  when officials planned the series of strip-mining cuts , they believed the brooklyn street cut was far enough away from the southern and western boundaries of the fire to contain it easily . but by feb. 8 , officials realized how close the fire had come to the area where they had expected to stop it .  that realization led the mayor to step up efforts . mining crews drilled holes along the old new york , ontario &amp; western railroad bed , directly behind the a&amp;p supermarket . temperatures in those holes were among the hottest since the project began , burning up to 1,200 degrees - which meant a change in the blasting schedule . previously , crews had been able to drill a number of holes , fill them with explosives and blasting caps , and detonate them all at one time . but with temperatures as high as they were , the explosives had to be detonated within three .  the project continued , but not smoothly . in early march , mr. howard and the state department of mines and mineral industries shut down operations after a blasting accident damaged buildings and automobiles . secretary of mines lewis evans lifted his ban about two weeks later .  mr. howard would not allow work to resume , however .  " we definitely want some type of assurance as to what you are going to do to guard against another such accident , " he told the mine company .  in late may , work at the bottom of the pits was again halted when a power shovel operator was killed in an earthslide in a pit at a different site in carbondale twp . officials feared the same could happen at the project in the city of carbondale . power shovels or trucks could plunge through the surface into the abandoned mines that lay just below the bottom of the pits , they feared . or the walls of the pits might collapse as the abandoned mines settled . the drag lines continued to operate as  the fire became visible on the surface for the first time on nov. 17 . crews unearthed the fire late in the afternoon in a strip trench along brooklyn street near the eighth avenue crossing of the delaware &amp; hudson railroad . the fire became visible when the rock that separated a top 5-foot vein from a 20-foot second vein collapsed into a long-abandoned tunnel . one observer said the fire seemed to be centered in pillars in the second vein . the rock layer between the two veins also appeared to be on fire , the man said .  despite a city ordinance prohibiting strip mining after 11 p.m. , mr. howard gave permission for around-the-clock efforts to halt the big blaze .  the redevelopment project continued , but the fire and the effort to contain it continued to plague the city of carbondale for years .  cheryl a. kashuba is a freelance writer specializing in local history . visit her at scrantonhistory.com . contact the writer : **30;0;toolong  we welcome user discussion on our site , under the following guidelines :  to comment verified disqus account or social network id . sign up here .  comments in violation of the rules will be denied , and repeat violators will be banned . please help police the community by flagging offensive comments for our moderators to review . by posting a comment , you agree to our full terms and conditions . click here to read terms and conditions .
