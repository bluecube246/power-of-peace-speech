D-Dalus - an entirely new genre of aircraft
http://www.gizmag.com/d-dalus-uav-design/18972/

<h> D-Dalus - an entirely new genre of aircraft arrives <p> Austrian research company IAT21 has presented a new type of aircraft at the Paris Air Show which has the potential to become aviation 's first disruptive technology since the jet engine . <p> The D-Dalus ( a play on Daedalus from Greek mythology ) is neither fixed wing or rotor craft and uses four , mechanically-linked , contra-rotating cylindrical turbines , each running at the same 2200 rpm , for its propulsion . <p> The key to the D-Dalus ' extreme maneuverability is the facility to alter the angle of the blades ( using servos ) to vector the forces , meaning that the thrust can be delivered in your choice of 360 degrees around any of the three axes . Hence D-Dalus can launch vertically , hover perfectly still and move in any direction , and that 's just the start of the story . <p> Like most cars and aircraft these days , it sounds very complex but it 's all controlled by computer algorithms , so it 's simple joystick control for the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Existing rotary wing aircraft offer VTOL capabilities but have vulnerabilities which make them unsuitable for many applications . They are challenged in bad weather , at long ranges , at high speed and in operating to and from lurching platforms , such as boats in rough weather . <p> By contrast , D-Dalus is particularly suited for such conditions and can thrust upwards and hence " glue down " on landing , which it can also do on a moving vehicle . Indeed , landing on a moving vehicle is one of the D-Dalus ' many party tricks , and it 's a natural for landing on watercraft . Not surprisingly , since it initially broke cover at the Royal Aeronautical Society conference a few days ago , it has already attracted a lot of interest from military quarters . <p> The D-Dalus is also near-silent , and has the dynamic stability to enter buildings and handle rough weather with ease - things which existing rotorcraft simply can not achieve . The aircraft also has a sense-and-avoid system which , in conjunction with its complete lack of vulnerable external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hover in very close proximity to vertical rock faces and walls , making it suitable for search-and-rescue operations , as a surveillance drone with hover-and-stare capabilities and as a proactive tool for urban battlefield situational awareness . <p> The lack of vulnerable external moving parts will give a small D-Dalus-type drone the ability to fly into buildings through windows , and its unique capabilities also offer 360 degree vision , another aspect lacking in traditional rotor craft which have blind spots due to the rotors , and nowhere near the same maneuverability as the D-Dalus . <p> IAT21 forsees many applications based on these key new criteria - apart from being able to enter and search buildings , it could conceivably remove radioactive contamination or explosives , extract casualties , or hold and direct water hoses for fire fighters . <p> As it can lift heavy loads , and becomes even more efficient in doing so as it scales upwards in size , it is also envisaged as a platform for loading and unloading ships when cranes are not available . <p> The D-Dalus is also so simple mechanically that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auto mechanic . It should be noted that all VTOL aircraft capable of carrying large payloads are complex and very costly to maintain . <p> Currently , tests are being conducted using a 120 bhp KTM engine and turbines around five feet long - and the capability of lifting a payload of 70 kg . More tests are planned over the coming weeks . IAT21 is now also working with Cranfield University in the U.K. on a larger , more powerful motor , a new hull shape for the craft , and advanced guidance and control systems . <p> The forces on the blade pivots are understandably huge , and in initial testing it was found that all available bearings failed , so inventor Meinhard Schwaiger , who already has more than 150 patents to his name , knuckled down and invented ( and patented ) his own , near-frictionless swivel-bearing to cope with the stresses . <p> The D-Dalus is constructed of carbon fiber , and appears to be scalable for a range of potential applications including maritime search and rescue , freight transport , operating alongside and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform include a passenger version for public transit . <p> Advertisement <p> About the Author <p> Mike grew up thinking he would become a mathematician , accidentally started motorcycle racing , got a job writing road tests for a motorcycle magazine while at university , and became a writer . As a travelling photojournalist during his early career , his work was published in a dozen languages across 20+ countries . He went on to edit or manage over 50 print publications , with target audiences ranging from pensioners to plumbers , many different sports , many car and motorcycle magazines , with many more in the fields of communication - narrow subject magazines on topics such as advertising , marketing , visual communications , design , presentation and direct marketing . Then came the internet and Mike managed internet projects for Australia 's largest multimedia company , Telstra.com.au ( Australia 's largest Telco ) , Seek.com.au ( Australia 's largest employment site ) , top100.com.au , hitwise.com , and a dozen other internet start-ups before founding Gizmag in 2002 . Now he writes and thinks . <p> Sounds pretty revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing actually flying soon ... <p> Windmaster Hiroaki21st June , 2011 @ 12:30 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> My first thought was that it was a vastly improved ducted relative of the spinning wing ( 1930 ) . But from the info it seems like Centrifugal fans . It would be nice to have more details on the principles of flight involved . " contra-rotating cylindrical turbines " suggests it is more like the later . Are we talking turbos like in cars ? Seems like superchargers move more air . The 2,200 RPM sounds more like a fan and less obnoxious sounding than a turbo/supercharger . The article also does not say where the air intake is . That seems like a major omission to me . Oh well , I guess we will hear more about it . <p> If it really is efficient , powerful , maneuverable , and easy to control , it might work in some sort of " jetpack " form . There was the scaling comment though ... so maybe not . <p> The actual numbers provided do not sound heavy lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real deal ... it looks very interesting . <p> I second the request for a video ! <p> Mindbreaker21st June , 2011 @ 4:53 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Someone on another site suggested it is a version of a Voith Schneider Propeller . That seems to fit . <p> Mindbreaker21st June , 2011 @ 5:07 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Sounds great , but I 'll believe it when I see it . I 've been burnt enough times by articles on gizmag making something sound like magic , only to come back the next week and debunk the myth . <p> Anyone remember that new dynamic ratio gearbox that was supposed to radically change the automotive industry forever ? No ? That 's because it turned out to be over-hyped crap . <p> Facebook User21st June , 2011 @ 5:44 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Excellent points Mindbreaker . And in retrospect , exciting as this is it lacks the helicopter 's ability to autorotate and glide from engine failure . Not that it should not still be persued however . Voith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:04 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> This would be how ' alien ' space ships move about wouldnt it ? ? ? <p> Facebook User21st June , 2011 @ 6:38 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Amost silent ? I find that hard to believe . Anyone knows that air moving at high velocities and volumes make shitloads of noise regardless of how its created . Nontheless it sounds like something worth following to see how it developes . <p> Terry Penrose21st June , 2011 @ 7:51 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Waiting to see a video , but the technology sounds incredible . <p> Alan Hutcheson21st June , 2011 @ 7:52 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> come on . how hard is it to post a video if it 's legit ? <p> Looks bad without one . <p> Adrien21st June , 2011 @ 9:15 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> funny that this company is about 2km away from where I live , and I had never heard of it ... <p> Martin Ankerl22nd June , 2011 @ 5:06 a.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concept to the Fanwing idea by Pat Peebles . That has great potential as well , if thought about from " outside the box " of traditional aviation design . I hope this advent shakes things up enough in aviation to finally get us up out of the gridlock traffic ( and those blasted signal lights ! ) : - ) Get that ol ' FAA on board early , folks ! <p> MzunguMkubwa22nd June , 2011 @ 6:13 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=uscW9RLcBpw here 's a video of the original concept - by an italian inventor . but the thing ca n't autorotate and land without engines - so it 's an UAV only technology for now . <p> K ? roly Hoss22nd June , 2011 @ 6:45 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> @ Martin . That 's coz " The D-Dalus is also near-silent " <p> Matthew Fletcher22nd June , 2011 @ 6:52 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> " ... I had never heard of it ... " <p> So it really IS silent ... ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assertion . <p> Gary Fisher22nd June , 2011 @ 6:59 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> If it WAS at the Paris Airshow - why no videos ? Comeon Gizmag - due dilligence in reporting please . <p> Tim Smalley22nd June , 2011 @ 7:11 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Thrust vectoring aside , it looks like it must have to rotate 90 degrees in order to change direction . With no lift created by wings , body or rotor , it must have to use substantial energy to stay aloft . I wonder if it can become the engine in a design that has , or can deploy , lifting surfaces for sustained flight ? <p> Muraculous22nd June , 2011 @ 7:37 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Hmmmm I guess there 's no point in mentioning that I had a similar design in mind for some years now , but sadly I never had the resources or the time to put it into practice : ) . My theory is that the concept already existed since the 50 ' and that secret military aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . <p> This is huge , combined with high capacity energy storage devices , light weight super materials and modern computers it could well lead to the development of transportation devices from as small as individual hovercraft to future space ships . <p> Inertial engines FTW <p> Stefan Padureanu22nd June , 2011 @ 8:46 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Nice to see a Privateer get a novel idea to fly . But you ca n't get something for nothing . It is hard to fathom that this " Vehicle " would be practicle in any way . <p> My fear is our stupid Government inspite of all logic and known technologies that have already proven themselves will be duped into spending Taxpayer dollars to figure out that this " Vehicle " is a flop . <p> People want something that they ca n't have ( yet ) , an Anti-Gravity machine that runs on something other that Petroleum that out performs proven platforms in use today . <p> David Nance22nd June , 2011 @ 9:02 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Looking at the pictures it clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not engage enough air and will be heavy and inefficient . Hence it is not a disruptive technology . It would be nice if Gizmag authors were more highly trained in the fields they are commenting on . <p> Rohn22nd June , 2011 @ 9:06 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> It appears to be a gang of Tesla turbines . If so , credit should be given where it 's due , instead of attention whoring as to originality . The app seems original , the turbine ? Not so much to me . <p> solutions4circuits22nd June , 2011 @ 9:24 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Well , if they did n't come up with a video or a small prototype , the best I can say is that I wish this was true . I I 've send my full description of a teleportation system to Gizmag and still I 'm waiting for the review to be published . : ) <p> salvatore.forte22nd June , 2011 @ 9:43 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> We now live where Bladerunner and The Fifth Element went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:37 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Maybe instead of pushing vast columns of air downward with fans it achieves lift as in a wing by moving/rotating the wing like aerofoils through the air within the 2200 rpm cylinders , is this feasible ? The aerofoils obviously pivot for directional control and each of the four cylinder 's have six of them . By using gyro and computer it could be very stable as described . <p> dgate22nd June , 2011 @ 10:41 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Like most things on Gizmag , I will wait to see if this ever actually pans out before getting excited about it . Mzungu , If anyone thinks ground traffic is bad , you ca n't imagine how bad it would be once even 0.1% of people fly to work . The constant noise , extreme fuel use , and " skylock " will very quickly change your mind and turn the public strongly against anyone flying low over their heads . For anyone in a city or town , imagine waiting in the air for clearance to proceed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while using the same fuel a car would to drive 150MPH , because it will take the same or more fuel to sit still in the air as it does to fly at speed . Commuting by air is a highly unrealistic pipe dream of people with no foresight . High speed ground transport is orders of magnitude more efficient and less intrusive for large portions of the population travelling every day . Flying to work would be nothing like the freedom of driving a car with the ability to just pull over or stop where you want to . Luckily , the insurance alone will kill " flying cars . " <p> Mark in MI22nd June , 2011 @ 10:54 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> I was there until the article said " frictionless bearing " . Then I smiled and realised it was a PR article so full of exaggeration and falsehoods . Probably hoping to get dumb investors . <p> Stuart Halliday22nd June , 2011 @ 12:05 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> It 's obvious that the reason that there 's no video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to the mechanical and aeronautical engineers of the world to assess the real-world viability of this concept , but for my part I am reminded of Moller 's sky car scam . <p> Bob Humbly22nd June , 2011 @ 12:24 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> The D-Dalus is certainly not based on a Tesla turbine , because between the rotating discs there are turnable wings mounted . To me this is a similar principle as is used for some vertical wind turbines . Depending on how the turnable wings are tilted during the rotation of the discs the resulting air draft can be directed into any direction . The noise of this type of turbine is very likely also not as strong as with propellers or gas turbines with high RPM , because there are no stationary wings and with 2200 RPM the whole thing is not extremely fast . But it wont be silent , especially if it is driven by a motorbike engine . <p> Why should we get-off from the ground ? A high speed train system running in low pressure underground tubes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CO2-free produced electricity . For todays aircraft this is absolutely impossible . <p> Newton2k122nd June , 2011 @ 1:50 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> D-Dalus . No it has bladed rotors , therefore it is not using Tesla turbine principle . <p> As with other aircraft , I.E. ducted fan , quad rotor &amp; Coanda effect machines on losing an engine they tend to glide like a brick . Therefore it would need to use a ballistic parachute or maybe mount on flying wing . <p> Otherwise it is brilliant as I would think maintainance is a killer in rotor aircraft . <p> " As with other aircraft , I.E. ducted fan , quad rotor &amp; Coanda effect machines on losing an engine they tend to glide like a brick . Therefore it would need to use a ballistic parachute or maybe mount on flying wing . " <p> If just plain crashing is good enough for a host of other aerial vehicles , then it 's good enough for this one . : - ) <p> " I 've send my full description of a teleportation system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be published . " <p> I may have an answer for you - did you use your teleportation system to send your description ? alcalde22nd June , 2011 @ 4:13 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Maybe the noise wo n't be all that bad as the rotors only turn 2200 rpm and the engine can be muffled . <p> Why does a technical publication such as this always post articles about " Zero Polution " vehicles ? There 's no such thing . Just because the vehicle is electric , compressed gas powerd or rubber band powered you have to get the energy from somewhere to start with . Imagane the polution from an electric vehicle if the charging recepticle is energized by an old coal fired generation plant ! <p> VHomer22nd June , 2011 @ 4:18 p.m .

( California Time ) <p> I wonder where its Ah-Killeez heel is ? <p> At 2200 rpm I ca n't imagine it not making noise enough to be considered silent . Being very familiar with rotary wing helicopters I can only draw on that experience to found my opinion but it seems that any ducted fan with a rotation of over 1000 rpm is going to make noise . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming up with and with that what the thrust to weight ratio is . <p> I do n't doubt that a large on may be able to do heavy lifting , but it may have to be a REALLY LARGE ONE to lift heavy . Possibly even a prohibitively large one . <p> I really want this to be true , but I am hearing way too much positive and find myself wishing they had thrown in at least one negative to make it more realistic . <p> Dr.Veritas22nd June , 2011 @ 5:59 p.m .

Some are continuing the development , obviously , as it appears to have great potential . <p> Still , despite all this , and perhaps because it has such a history , there appears to be valid potential in the concept , and with modern advances and development perhaps these can be leveraged to our advantage ! <p> MzunguMkubwa23rd June , 2011 @ 6:05 a.m .

( California Time ) <p> The principle works in water ; If the novel bearing is for real , and the weight can be kept down , it could be the 1st iteration of the next big thing . <p> This concept is called cycloidal-rotor ( also known as cyclogyro/cyclocopter ) . This was invented almost 100 years back , but then , no one could build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the scene by around 1940s . My entire PhD thesis was on understanding and using this concept to build a flying MAV ( Micro Air Vehicle ) .

( California Time ) <p> Are they using servos for each individual blade , or are they using a helicopter-style collective and cyclic mechanical setup ? I would think it is far more likely that it is the latter <p> I meant collective pitch as in , if the blades on the ' front ' cylinders are angled inwards so that they collectively draw in air , while the blades at the ' back ' are all angled outwards so they expel air , the craft would move to the ' front ' <p> Perhaps additional axial blade elemens i.e. arranged like a traditional propeller , would enhance the inter-cylinder thrust and have more ' longitudinal ' thrust , which should be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge-on rather than side-on <p> Carmatic Frua22nd August , 2011 @ 3:54 a.m .

( California Time ) <p> As the former P.I.O. photographer for the 8th Transportation Battalion , Light Helicopters at Oberschleissheim ( near Munich ) , West Germany , I can heartily attest as to their noise ( especially a small H-13 without the " Bubble " canopy ) . However , the article specifically uses the term , " Contra-Rotating Fans " which brings this thought to mind . There is an acoustical concept that states , " A standing half wave cancels itself " . It 's one of the main principles that made Alembic speaker cabinets sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in Santa Rosa , California and concentrate on just making high end electric stringed instruments and associated electronics . ) But the principle is still acoustically the same . <p> Myron J. Poltroonian25th February , 2012 @ 6:31 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Looks like it is 4 individually controlled cyclocopters ( fanwings minus the wing ) and each engine would be able to produce thrust in any direction . so it can rotate in place by having the two on the right produce thrust upward and forward while the left ones produce thrust in the upward and rearward direction . this sort of design is cool because it could even flip over either front to back or side to side and fly upside down easily . it has all the capabilities and stability of a quadcopter with the additional capability of producing a lot of forward thrust while staying level . <p> Ashley Elliott15th March , 2012 @ 9:52 p.m .

The orbit is eliptical and presents the most efficient incident angle for a much longer period and wastes little time in the end period of orbit where the transistion is made to the other side of the flattened circle .
