9 , taplejung has made his 1st summit on mt . everest . we entire family of arun treks &amp; expeditions would like send a huge congratulation to all of them . news by dawa lama ( arun treks &amp; expeditions )  earlier :  this is dawa lama from arun treks &amp; expedition , kathmandu , nepal . this morning our everest team have made the summit of mt . everest  a 32 years lady from arunachal pradesh , india anshu jamsenpa along with team sirdar mr lakpa rangdu sherpa , nima nuru sherpa , lakpa chiree sherpa , and miss churim sherpa reached on the summit of everest on 12th may , 7.00 am ( nepali local time ) in the morning . anshu and sherpas have started their summit push from south col last night at about 8pm . they are now descending for camp ii and will arrive at base camp by tomorrow .  miss . churim sherpa , age 27 years 25 days starting from ktm on 18th april and reach on the summit of mt . everest on 12th may . i think this is some thing special and it might be a new record among the nepalese women mt . everest summiteers .  our 2nd summit team has started from base camp today morning and they have planned to attempt summit on 15th morning , as 16th morning looks pretty high wind speed .  this is a picture of the popular south col route up mt . everest . base camp is located at 17,500 feet . this is where climbers begin their true trip up the mountain . this is also where support staff often remain to monitor the expeditions and provide medical assistance when necessary . many organizations offer hiking trips which just go to base camp as the trip is not technically challenging ( though you must be very fit ) .  from base camp , climbers typically train and acclimate ( permitting the body to adjust to the decreased oxygen in the air ) by traveling and bringing supplies back and forth through continues throughout the climb , with the final summit push often being the only time to climbers do not go back and forth between camps to train , bring supplies , and recuperate for the next push .  the icefall is in constant motion . it contains enormous ice seracs , often larger than houses , which dangle precariously over the climbers heads , threatening to fall at any moment without warning , as the climbers cross endless crevasses and listen to continuous ice creaking below . this often acts as a testing ground to judge if less experienced climbers will be capable of continuing . the icefall is located between 17,500 and 19,500 feet .  camp i - 5900 meters  after the icefall , the climbers arrive at camp i , which is located at 19,500 feet . depending on the type of expedition , camp i will either be stocked by the climbers as they ascend and descend the icefall , or by sherpas in advance .  the area between camp i and camp ii is known as the western cwm . as the climbers temporarily out of sight of their support at base camp . nonetheless , modern communication devises permit the parties to stay in contact .  camp ii - 6500 meters  as the climbers leave camp ii , they travel towards the lhotse face ( lhotse is a 27,920 foot mountain bordering everest ) . the lhotse face is a steep , shiny icy wall . though not technically extremely difficult , one misstep or slip could mean a climber 's life . indeed , many climbers have lost their lives through such mishaps .  camp iii - 23,700 feet ( 7200 meters )  to reach camp iii , climbers must negotiate the lhotse face . climbing a sheer wall of ice demands skill , strength and stamina . it is so steep and treacherous that many sherpas move directly from camp ii to camp iv on the south col , refusing to stay on the lhotse face .  camp iv - 26,300 feet ( 8000 meters )  as you ? re leaving c4 ? it ? s a little bit of a down slope , with snow on the ledges to walk down on , interspersed with rock , along with some fixed rope . the problem with the rope is that the anchors are bad , and there ? s not much holding the rope and a fall could be serious . fortunately it ? s not too steep , but there is a ton of exposure and people are usually tired when walking down from camp . the rock is a little down sloping to the right as well , and with crampons on , it can be bit tricky with any kind of wind . there ? s a little short slope on reliable snow which leads to the top of the geneva spur , and the wind pressure gradient across the spur can increase there as you ? re getting set up for the rappel . wearing an oxygen mask here can create some footing issues during the rappel , because it ? s impossible to see over the mask and down to the feet . for that reason , some people choose to leave camp 4 without gas , as it ? ? s important to see all the small rock steps and where the old feet are going . navigating down through all of the spaghetti of fixed ropes is a bit of a challenge , especially with mush for brains at that point . one lands on some lower ledges which aren ? t so steep , where fixed ropes through here are solid . at this point , it ? s just a matter of staying upright , and usually , the wind has died significantly after dropping off the spur . the route turns hard to the left onto the snowfield that leads to the top of the yellow bands .  camp iv , which is at 26,300 on the lhotse face , is typically the climbers ' first overnight stay in the death zone . the death zone is above 26,000 feet . though there is nothing magical about that altitude , it is at this altitude that most human bodies lose all ability to acclimate . accordingly , the body slowly begins to deteriorate and die - thus , the name " death zone . " more likely illness ( hace - high altitude cerebral edema - or hape - high altitude pulmonary edema ) or death will occur . most climbers will use oxygen to climb and sleep at this altitude and above . generally , sherpas refuse to sleep on the lhotse face and will travel to either camp ii or camp iv .  camp iv is located at 26,300 feet . this is the final major camp for the summit push . it is at this point that the climbers make their final preparations . it is also a haven for worn-out climbers on their exhausting descent from summit attempts ( both successful and not ) . sherpas or other climbers will often wait here with supplies and hot tea for returning climbers .  from camp iv , climbers will push through the balcony , at 27,500 feet , to the hillary step at 28,800 feet . the hillary step , an over 70 foot rock step , is named after sir . edmond hillary , who in 1953 , along with tenzing norgay , became the first people to summit everest ropes , often becomes a bottleneck as only one climber can climb at a time . though the hillary step would not be difficult at sea level for experienced climbers , at everest 's altitude , it is considered the most technically challenging aspect of the climb .  summit - 29,028 feet ( 8848 meters )  once the climbers ascend the hillary step , they slowly and laboriously proceed to the summit at 29,028 feet . the summit sits at the top of the world . though not the closest place to the sun due to the earth 's curve , it is the highest peak on earth . due to the decreased air pressure , the summit contains less than one third the oxygen as at sea level . if dropped off on the summit directly from sea level ( impossible in reality ) , a person would die within minutes . typically , climbers achieving the great summit will take pictures , gain their composure , briefly enjoy the view , then return to camp iv as quickly as possible . the risk of staying at the great to permit climbers to fully enjoy the great accomplishment at that moment .  as most readers of this page know , the return trip can be even more dangerous than the climb to the summit .  millet one sport everest boot expedition and mountaineering boot for high altitude and extremely cold conditions . the everest has conquered all 14 mountains over 8,000m and also the seven summits- and has now had a makeover to ensure continued peak preformance . with a newer sung , alpine fit , and even lighter expedition footwear for mountaineering in conditions of extreme cold . note us sizes listed . see more here .
