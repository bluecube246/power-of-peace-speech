<h> TV Tonight : Traffic Light <p> In Showtime 's comedy Episodes , a pair of British sitcom producers have lunch with Matt LeBlanc , who 's considering starring in a remake of their comedy about a headmaster at a boys ' school . LeBlanc notes that it sounds like The History Boys , and the more the couple try to explain the differences , the more it does in fact sound like that play . " So , " LeBlanc says : " it 's History Boys meets you saying it 's not History Boys . " <p> Traffic Light , a new sitcom debuting tonight on Fox , is Perfect Couples and Better With You meets Fox saying it 's not Perfect Couples or Better With You . But in this case that 's not entirely bad . <p> The more you get into the details , the more similar it sounds , to those shows -- which themselves are essentially the Modern Family formula applied to relationships -- and to the philosophy of almost every recent network sitcom about couples . There are three couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of development . Mike ( David Denman of The Office ) and Lisa ( Liza Lapira ) are married with a young son . Adam ( Nelson Franklin ) and Callie ( Aya Cash ) have just moved in together , a leap in commitment that is causing Adam no little stress . And Ethan ( Kris Marshall ) is a horndog bachelor who goes from relationship to intense , short-lived relationship . <p> Why Traffic Light ? Each of the guys , see , is at a different " light " in his life . Ethan has the green light , because he 's single . ( Lest you miss the metaphor , he drives an ambulance . ) Adam is slowing down at a yellow , i.e. , a marriage-like commitment . And Mike , of course , is at red . Because he 's been stopped . By a girl . <p> On paper , it sounds like another sitcom dedicated to the tired idea that relationships are forced on men like collars on dogs , the leashes held by annoying , fun-killing women . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am describing it . Partly that 's because the show , over the course of the episodes , reveals that it does n't really sign on to this high-concept premise : each of the relationships has stress and conflicts -- or else there would be no show . But it quickly becomes apparent that these men ( Mike and Adam , anyway ) really like being paired up , that their significant others are partners and interesting people in their own right , and that , like men in real life , they 're in relationships because they want to be . <p> Maybe more important , Traffic Light gets the relationships among its different subunits better than Perfect Couples . One of my issues with that NBC sitcom is that -- family connections aside -- the characters seem so annoying , to each other and the audience , that it 's not clear why they would want to spend this much time with each other in the first place . Traffic Light does n't push its characters to extremes ( Ethan being the possible exception , and the weakest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters actually like one another . And the show has a loose , dry humor that Franklin , in particular , pulls off well . <p> The show hardly seems like the rethinking of its form that Modern Family was for family sitcoms . For instance , there are way too many gags involving conferenced-in cellphone conversations in cars , which is quick becoming TV 's biggest clich ? . But after the four episodes I 've seen , Traffic Light is Perfect Couples and Better With You meets Perfect Couples and Better With You being funnier . That 's a start .
