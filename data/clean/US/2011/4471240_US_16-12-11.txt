regular citizens now in charge of sweden 's twitter account  oh those crazy , free-wheeling swedes . it appears the country has decided to allow regular citizens to man its official twitter feed .  that 's right , instead of boring government announcements and links to policy proposals , sweden will now be tweeting hilarious jokes and mundane details about everyday life . according to the next web , the tweeters include " an editorial writer , a founder of an advertising agency with his own farm , a suburban writer , a priest , a teacher and a coffee-drinking trucker lesbian . "  the whole thing was organized by sweden 's tourism agency , who is calling the project " curators of sweden . " the first citizen is writer jack werner , who is really taking this tweet-whatever-you-want policy to heart . good people of sweden , know that jack has just discovered joe cocker , made his girlfriend drop her juice by giving her a hug , and does not -- i repeat -- does not like justin bieber .  believe this was the greatest idea sweden has had since robyn -- and made me want to be best friends with jack werner forever :
