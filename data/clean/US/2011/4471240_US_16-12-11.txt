<h> Regular Citizens Now in Charge of Sweden 's Twitter Account <p> Oh those crazy , free-wheeling Swedes . It appears the country has decided to allow regular citizens to man its official Twitter feed . <p> That 's right , instead of boring government announcements and links to policy proposals , Sweden will now be tweeting hilarious jokes and mundane details about everyday life . According to The Next Web , the tweeters include " an editorial writer , a founder of an advertising agency with his own farm , a suburban writer , a priest , a teacher and a coffee-drinking trucker lesbian . " <p> The whole thing was organized by Sweden 's tourism agency , who is calling the project " Curators of Sweden . " The first citizen is writer Jack Werner , who is really taking this tweet-whatever-you-want policy to heart . Good people of Sweden , know that Jack has just discovered Joe Cocker , made his girlfriend drop her juice by giving her a hug , and does not -- I repeat -- does not like Justin Bieber . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this was the greatest idea Sweden has had since Robyn -- and made me want to be best friends with Jack Werner forever :
