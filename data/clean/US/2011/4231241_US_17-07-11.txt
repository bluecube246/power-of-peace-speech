" <p> Humanity 's " most pervasive " effect on nature may be its destruction of large predators and other animals at the top of the food chain , which has disrupted ecosystems globally , a study concludes . The finding is reported in this week 's issue of the journal Science . While conservation measures such as putting sharks in the seas may prove unpopular to say the least , the researchers say re-introducing some decimated top predators to nature may be the only way to undo a host of unwanted consequences that have already come back to bite us . Such measures , they add , require the restoration of large tracts to nature rather than piecemeal approaches . " These animals roam over large areas , " said James Estes , a marine ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , and lead author of the study . " You ca n't restore large ' apex consumers ' on an acre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for animals at the top of the food web . The study looked at research results from a wide range of land , freshwater and marine ecosystems and concluded " the loss of apex consumers is arguably humankind 's most pervasive influence on the natural world . " Large animals were once ubiquitous across the globe , Estes said . They shaped the structure and dynamics of ecosystems . Their decline , largely caused by humans through hunting and habitat fragmentation , has far-reaching and often surprising consequences , the study found . These include changes in vegetation , wildfire frequency , infectious diseases , invasive species , water quality and nutrient cycles . Plummeting numbers of " apex consumers " are most pronounced among the big predators , the researchers said . These animals include as wolves on land , sharks in the oceans , and large fish in freshwater ecosystems . There also are dramatic declines in populations of many large plant eaters , such as elephants and bison . The loss of apex consumers from an ecosystem triggers an ecological phenomenon known as a " trophic cascade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food chain . The research " highlights the unanticipated effects of trophic cascades on Earth systems , including far-reaching processes such as biogeochemical cycles , " said David Garrison , director of the Biological Oceanography Program at the U.S. National Science Foundation , which helped fund the project . " The removal of predators like sharks and sea otters , bass and wolves has consequences , " he added , " not only for these species , but for all of us . " " The top-down effects of apex consumers in an ecosystem are fundamentally important , but it is a complicated phenomenon , " Estes said . " They have diverse and powerful effects on the ways ecosystems work , and the loss of these large animals has widespread implications . " Among the examples Estes and co-authors cite : The extirpation of wolves in Yellowstone National Park led to over-browsing of aspen and willows by elk ; restoration of wolves allowed the vegetation to recover . Dramatic changes in coastal ecosystems followed the collapse and recovery of sea otter populations . Sea otters maintain coastal kelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decimation of sharks in an estuarine ecosystem caused an outbreak of cow-nosed rays and the collapse of shellfish populations . Despite these and other well-known examples , the extent to which such interactions shape ecosystems was not widely appreciated , scientists say . " There 's been a tendency to see it as idiosyncratic and specific to particular species and ecosystems , " Estes said . One reason for this is the top-down effects of apex predators are difficult to observe and study . " These interactions are invisible unless there is some perturbation that reveals them , " Estes said . " With these large animals , it 's impossible to do the kinds of experiments that would be needed to show their effects , so the evidence has been acquired as a result of natural changes and long-term records . " The study 's findings have profound implications for conservation , he added . " To the extent that conservation aims to restore functional ecosystems , the reestablishment of large animals and their ecological effects is fundamental , " Estes said . " This has huge implications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to require large-scale approaches . "
