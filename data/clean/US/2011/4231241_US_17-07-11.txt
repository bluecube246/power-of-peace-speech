"  humanity 's " most pervasive " effect on nature may be its destruction of large predators and other animals at the top of the food chain , which has disrupted ecosystems globally , a study concludes . the finding is reported in this week 's issue of the journal science . while conservation measures such as putting sharks in the seas may prove unpopular to say the least , the researchers say re-introducing some decimated top predators to nature may be the only way to undo a host of unwanted consequences that have already come back to bite us . such measures , they add , require the restoration of large tracts to nature rather than piecemeal approaches . " these animals roam over large areas , " said james estes , a marine ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the university of california , santa cruz , and lead author of the study . " you ca n't restore large ' apex consumers ' on an acre of for animals at the top of the food web . the study looked at research results from a wide range of land , freshwater and marine ecosystems and concluded " the loss of apex consumers is arguably humankind 's most pervasive influence on the natural world . " large animals were once ubiquitous across the globe , estes said . they shaped the structure and dynamics of ecosystems . their decline , largely caused by humans through hunting and habitat fragmentation , has far-reaching and often surprising consequences , the study found . these include changes in vegetation , wildfire frequency , infectious diseases , invasive species , water quality and nutrient cycles . plummeting numbers of " apex consumers " are most pronounced among the big predators , the researchers said . these animals include as wolves on land , sharks in the oceans , and large fish in freshwater ecosystems . there also are dramatic declines in populations of many large plant eaters , such as elephants and bison . the loss of apex consumers from an ecosystem triggers an ecological phenomenon known as a " trophic cascade , of the food chain . the research " highlights the unanticipated effects of trophic cascades on earth systems , including far-reaching processes such as biogeochemical cycles , " said david garrison , director of the biological oceanography program at the u.s. national science foundation , which helped fund the project . " the removal of predators like sharks and sea otters , bass and wolves has consequences , " he added , " not only for these species , but for all of us . " " the top-down effects of apex consumers in an ecosystem are fundamentally important , but it is a complicated phenomenon , " estes said . " they have diverse and powerful effects on the ways ecosystems work , and the loss of these large animals has widespread implications . " among the examples estes and co-authors cite : the extirpation of wolves in yellowstone national park led to over-browsing of aspen and willows by elk ; restoration of wolves allowed the vegetation to recover . dramatic changes in coastal ecosystems followed the collapse and recovery of sea otter populations . sea otters maintain coastal kelp decimation of sharks in an estuarine ecosystem caused an outbreak of cow-nosed rays and the collapse of shellfish populations . despite these and other well-known examples , the extent to which such interactions shape ecosystems was not widely appreciated , scientists say . " there 's been a tendency to see it as idiosyncratic and specific to particular species and ecosystems , " estes said . one reason for this is the top-down effects of apex predators are difficult to observe and study . " these interactions are invisible unless there is some perturbation that reveals them , " estes said . " with these large animals , it 's impossible to do the kinds of experiments that would be needed to show their effects , so the evidence has been acquired as a result of natural changes and long-term records . " the study 's findings have profound implications for conservation , he added . " to the extent that conservation aims to restore functional ecosystems , the reestablishment of large animals and their ecological effects is fundamental , " estes said . " this has huge implications for the going to require large-scale approaches . "
