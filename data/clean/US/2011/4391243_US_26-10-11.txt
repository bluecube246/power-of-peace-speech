<h> Ballerina reveals beauty of surfing to China <p> China 's Darci Liu is pictured after her heat at the Swatch Girls Pro China surfing competition in Wanning , Hainan Island October 26 , 2011 . <p> Reuters/Will Swanton <p> HAINAN ISLAND , China A ballerina " danced across the sea " to introduce professional surfing to China on Wednesday . <p> Darci Liu received a wildcard for the first event held in her homeland by the Association of Surfing Professionals , and she was swarmed by spectators as she emerged from the water after an opening round defeat by San Diego 's Jennifer Smith . <p> " I feel very grateful and very proud to have had the chance to surf here and to compete against a champion like Jennifer , " Liu told Reuters . " She is the best surfer in the world and this is the biggest day of my life . <p> " I want more people in China to know about surfing and this is the start . It is a graceful and beautiful sport , it is dancing across the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I feel like the baby of the event , but the baby is very excited . It 's why I have a smile on my face that will last a long time . " <p> Liu studied ballet at the Hubei Provincial Art School before dancing professionally in Guangdong in 2006 . It was only the following year that Liu , from Hainan Island , was encouraged by her Californian husband to catch her first wave . <p> She created a slice of history here by becoming the first Chinese surfer to compete in an ASP event -- the Swatch Girls Pro China is doubling as the women 's longboard world championship . <p> " These surfers will be remembered as pioneers , " said Brodie Carr , the Association of Surfing Professionals chief executive . " We thought China was an impossible place for us to enter , but we 've done it . We 're here and this is just the beginning . <p> " China is a powerful athletic country , a vast country and marketplace with a potential billion-strong audience for us . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've entered a new frontier . This is a landmark day that we 'll be looking back on for years to come . " <p> Most competitors , including two-times world champion Smith , were completely unaware China had surf until the venue was announced this year . The opening ceremony was a lavish affair with dancing , singing and fireworks . <p> Carr said more surfing events for Hainan Island , a lush , palm tree-lined area being promoted as the Hawaii of Asia , were in the pipeline . <p> The mayor of Wanning said Liu 's debut had helped put Hainan Island on the map of world surfing . <p> " China has open arms to surfing from this day , " he said . " We want new tourists to come to beautiful and dynamic Wanning . <p> " We have a healthy , passionate and dynamic coastal location and we want to popularize surfing in China . "
