<h> Related Articles <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : And I 'm Shirley Griffith with EXPLORATIONS in VOA Special English . Today we explore ways in which local governments around the world are working to protect the environment . <p> These " green cities " are working to reduce energy use and pollution in inventive and effective ways . Such efforts by city governments not only help reverse the effects of climate change . They also help governments save large amounts of money on energy costs . And , cities that are leaders in this green movement set a good example to their citizens about the importance of environmental issues . <p> ( MUSIC ) <p> STEVE EMBER : The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement aimed at reducing the release of harmful gases believed to cause climate change . The United States is not part of the agreement . But since two thousand five , more than one thousand mayors across the country have agreed to sign their own version of the protocol . <p> It is called the United States Conference of Mayors ' Climate Protection Agreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyoto Protocol in their communities . They have also agreed to urge state and federal governments to follow these suggestions . One goal is to reduce air pollution to nineteen ninety levels by two thousand twelve . <p> A " green " city might work on several kinds of environmental goals and programs . These include air quality , reducing electricity use , green building , public health , the reuse of materials , water quality and clean transportation . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : The Natural Resources Defense Council works to protect the environment through activism , law and science . One of its online projects is called Smarter Cities . This web site gives a list of cities that have made important environmental steps . Its two thousand ten list includes twenty-two cities that have supported investing in green power and reducing energy use . The list is divided into large , medium and small cities . <p> STEVE EMBER : Boston , Massachusetts was second on the big city list . It is the largest city buyer of wind power in New England . It is also using its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small wind turbines at Logan International Airport . And there are other wind projects around the city . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : Austin , Texas leads the large city list , while Chicago , Illinois is third . Both cities have made big efforts to reduce a problem called urban heat islands . An urban heat island is a city area that is warmer than its surrounding rural area . This is caused by several things , such as dark colored roofs which absorb heat from the sun during the daytime , and release that heat at night . Air conditioners cooling the inside of buildings add to the increased temperatures by generating hot air outdoors . <p> Austin has launched an Urban Heat Island Mitigation Project to improve the situation . The city is planting more trees . And it is rewarding businesses and individuals who have reflective roofs . This kind of surface absorbs less heat . <p> STEVE EMBER : Chicago has long been interested in green roofs . In two thousand , city officials decided to replace the black tar roof on the city government building with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , improve air quality and control the amount of rainwater entering the city 's waste system . Green roofs also help reduce urban heat islands . <p> During hot weather , the building 's tar roof could reach temperatures of up to seventy-six degrees Celsius . <p> With the garden , the temperature of the roof area was reduced by at least thirty degrees Celsius . Chicago has since created over three hundred thousand square meters of green roofs . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : Washington , D.C. is also a leading city for green roofs , with over ninety two thousand square meters of green rooftops . The city also launched a program called " Skip the Bag , Save the River . " Stores charge people a five cent tax for using plastic or paper shopping bags instead of reusable bags . Money from the tax will be used to clean up a local river . <p> New York City is using water as a renewable energy source . For several years , the city has experimented with using waves in the East River to create energy . Officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place thirty river turbine devices . <p> ( MUSIC ) <p> STEVE EMBER : The people of Portland , Oregon are among the top recyclers in the nation . People living there recycle over half of the waste they throw out . The city has also worked to provide green transportation by providing safe bike paths and free parking spaces where electric cars can recharge . <p> In Oakland , California , you can ride on one of several public hydrogen-powered buses . These buses release zero pollution into the air . However , they cost about five times more than common buses . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : Cost is also a major issue in creating green buildings and systems . Green building materials and systems usually cost more money than normal ones . However , homeowners are increasingly willing to pay more money to have lower energy costs in the future . And , builders are offering more green building methods and products as they become more important to buyers . <p> Many cities offer money for homeowners who put in place green technologies such as solar power systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeowners . <p> Investors are also taking a big interest in the growing importance of clean technologies . The Cleantech Group researches the clean energy industry . It said that North American companies in two thousand ten raised over five billion dollars for investment in clean technologies . This is an increase of forty-five percent from two thousand nine . <p> ( MUSIC ) <p> STEVE EMBER : The United States Green Building Council is changing the way people build in cities . This nonprofit organization has a rating system for making environmentally safe public and private buildings . It is called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , or LEED . Many cities now require that new buildings be built according to LEED environmental requirements . <p> LEED is not the only rating system for green buildings . For example , the National Association of Homebuilders has its own set of rules . And , the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy joined to create the Energy Star program . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : Energy Star gives ratings to devices for the home based on how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make changes to their houses to use energy effectively . Energy Star estimates that in two thousand nine it helped Americans avoid the release of harmful gases equal to what thirty million cars would produce . And , it says Americans saved seventeen billion dollars on energy costs . <p> STEVE EMBER : One small town in Kansas is about as green as its name . In May of two thousand seven , a tornado windstorm destroyed most of the town of Greensburg , Kansas . The town decided to rebuild in a better way , using green methods . <p> Greensburg officials decided that all public building projects would follow LEED top-level requirements . For example , the 5.4.7 . Arts Center is completely powered by energy from the wind and sun . It was named after the date the tornado struck . The television station Planet Green aired a program on the town called " Greensburg . " Over three seasons , the show told about the town , its people , and the green building efforts . <p> ( MUSIC ) <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Masdar City project . Its aim is to be the greenest city in the world . The city will meet environmental rules set by the World Wide Fund for Nature 's One Living Planet and the company BioRegional . Masdar City is about seventeen kilometers from the capital , Abu Dhabi . The goal for Masdar City was to produce no waste , no carbon pollution and contain only electric cars . The city is to create renewable energy from the wind , sun and other technologies . <p> However , economic troubles have slowed the project . The city was expected to be completed by twenty sixteen . But officials now say the city will be completed in stages . And , the city will not at first be completely carbon-neutral . <p> One important part of the city is Masdar Institute . This research university is being developed in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , Massachusetts . The goal of the university is to make the United Arab Emirates a leader in renewable energy technologies . Experts say developments like this may lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( MUSIC ) <p> STEVE EMBER : This program was written and produced by Dana Demange . I 'm Steve Ember.
