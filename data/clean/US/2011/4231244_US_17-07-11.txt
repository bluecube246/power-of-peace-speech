u.s. women 's soccer and the problem of american exceptionalism  as i write this article a few hours after the u.s. women 's soccer team beat france in the world cup semifinals , i know that if they lose in the finals , the american excitement toward soccer will wane once again . to be perfectly honest , soccer in our country will continue to be considered a boring , low-scoring game that rarely generates interest or excitement among american sports fans .  but , for now , u.s. soccer -- nay , u.s. women 's soccer -- is the talk of the town . some have argued that it 's the talk of the town by default , because all the other sports are involved in contentious labor disputes ; and baseball , well , september is still far away . others contend that they have become the darlings of our country because of their flair for the dramatic and the thrill of their quarterfinal victory over brazil . while these factors have contributed to the sudden popularity of soccer in the u.s. , why the country is captivated by these women , and it serves as an important reminder to us about our priorities and goals in life .  we americans have this obsessive need to be the best at whatever we do . we are the most powerful country in the world , and we never miss an opportunity to remind others of our superiority . our culture and politics are based on " american exceptionalism , " which means that we believe that we are better than everyone else . therefore , if there is an activity or program that we are n't the best at , we tend to quickly rationalize and explain that our deficiency should not be confused with our inadequacy . " who needs soccer , " we say to the rest of the world . it 's not that important to us . we play football , a real man 's sport .  however , in our heart of hearts , we know the reality -- that soccer is the world 's sport . and we really want to be the best at soccer . they are not a championship-caliber team quite yet . we get excited when they win a couple of games , but we do n't expect anything more than that . with the women 's soccer team , though , there is a different feeling in the air . we really believe that they can win and that they can be the best . we , therefore , do n't feel ashamed or timid to cheer and brag about our women 's soccer team to the rest of the world . we jump on the bandwagon with great enthusiasm .  i believe this tendency to jump on the bandwagon when our national team is enjoying success is representative of the american sports culture . we are n't interested in mere competition ; the thrill of participation is not satisfying enough . what matters is that we win -- not just one game , but everything . indeed , after the u.s. women 's thrilling victory against brazil , the sportswriters were questioning the team 's ability to regroup and refocus , and predicted that if they do n't win the world by amy wambach in extra time .  our collective attitude toward tennis , golf and the olympics are illustrative of this cultural phenomenon . in years past , when the top tennis players were american , like connors and mcenroe , tennis boomed in this country . more recently , with no transcendent american star , interest has waned . the same is true in golf . now that tiger woods is no longer dominant , golf is not as big a draw as it was just a few years ago . similarly , ratings are routinely higher for the summer olympics , where the americans usually win the medal count , compared to the winter games in which we are constantly bested by other countries .  we american 's revere the great football coach vince lombardi , who famously said , " winning is n't everything , it 's the only thing . " but is this credo something we really want to live by ? when we teach our children to play sports , we stress the thrill and value of competition , not winning . we or lose , but how you play the game . "  unfortunately , that ideal is often forgotten once we actually begin to compete . by and large , american culture no longer believes that maxim . instead , we have become a nation wedded to the concept that " winning is the only thing . " how sad . we have lost the joy that comes from challenging ourselves to compete , and from knowing that we have given our best effort , even if we did n't win .  the unhealthy emphasis placed on winning in our society , conflicts with one of the basic precepts of judaism , which values the journey toward perfection and recognizes that true perfection is only found in god . this idea is evidenced by the biblical commandment that every jew study the bible . it does n't matter whether he or she will become a scholar , rabbi , businessperson or mailman . from the jewish perspective , the pursuit of knowledge is far more important and commendable than being the best or most knowledgeable . every person is obligated jew he can be , even if he never achieves renown or greatness .  so while we revel in the achievement of the women 's soccer team ( for now ) , we should learn to appreciate athletes who give their all and compete to the best of their ability , even when they fall short of their goals and our national dreams . win or lose , good or bad , we would be wise to show the same excitement and zeal when we observe valiant competitors in any walk of life , striving for excellence , so that our children will learn to appreciate the thrill and joy of competition . that 's the true american spirit .
