Suspects , witness dispute police version of July 1 arrest in Nashua  NASHUA -- Maybe Michael Gannon should n't have given lip to two police detectives that afternoon .  But Gannon claims he would n't have said a word on July 1 if a detective -- unprovoked , Gannon said -- had n't shouted something at him as their unmarked police car passed by on Canal Street .  At the time , Gannon said he was standing with his back to traffic in a parking spot commonly used by motorcycles across from the Dunkin ' Donuts near the intersection of Canal and Main streets .  Gannon said he did n't hear the exact words the Nashua police detective yelled from the passenger window , but he caught the gist .  " They said something about my son only they and I would know , " Gannon said .  Gannon 's teenage son has been in trouble with the law . So has he . It was in this context that Gannon responded as he did , he said .  " 55 , of 24 Temple St. , admits he yelled back at the passing police detectives .  That precipitated a chain of events in which Gannon was tackled , maced , handcuffed and then punched and kicked by two police detectives as he lay on the ground , according to Gannon and two witnesses , Pamela Reynolds , who was also arrested , and her boyfriend , Brian Raymond .  All three say Gannon did n't resist arrest , only turned his back and began to walk away from the detectives after being told he was n't under arrest .  " I did n't have time to resist , " Gannon said .  The two detectives were on him immediately , he said .  He and the other two witnesses said police overreacted to his wisecrack .  " I blew his ego with that comment . By all means , that detective was unglued , " Gannon said .  It also probably did n't help Gannon 's cause that he told police he was videotaping the incident with a small Kodak mini camcorder . he does n't know the detectives ' names , but he recognized their faces through his past dealings with police .  The Nashua Police Department 's version of what happened about 5 p.m . July 1 differs markedly .  " Mr. Gannon was yelling and swearing and was warned repeatedly to cease that behavior , " Detective Lt. Frank Sullivan said .  When Gannon did n't desist , the officers placed him under arrest -- " and he did resist an arrest , " Sullivan said .  According to information police released after the incident , Gannon was recording police . When he was told he was under arrest , Gannon handed his video camera to Pamela Reynolds , 44 , of 76 Spit Brook Road , Nashua .  Officers demanded Reynolds give them the camera as evidence , but she fled and tried to hide the camera in some bushes , police said . She also struggled with officers when they caught up with her , police said .  Reynolds disputes the police account .  She said she was in the green area , who was walking his own dog , showed up and they began chatting .  As Gannon was being tackled by police , he tossed the camcorder to her , which she immediately threw into nearby pushes , she said , because she did n't want anything to do with device or with the incident .  Instead , she found herself arrested and maced , Reynolds said .  Her boyfriend , Brian Raymond , was with her .  " She did absolutely nothing but be at the wrong place at the wrong time , " Raymond said . " The whole thing was not fair . It was n't right . "  Raymond also said Gannon was trying to walk away and end the confrontation before he was arrested , but the detectives " would n't let him . They blocked his path , " Raymond said .  Raymond acknowledged that Gannon 's wisecrack to the passing police car was probably " not the right thing to have done . I would n't have done it . But it 's not against the law . assault on a police officer and disorderly conduct .  Police are applying for a search warrant to look at the footage on the video camera , which police seized , Sullivan said .  In 2006 , Gannon was arrested on felony wiretapping charges after he brought the recordings to the police station to complain that a detective was rude to him . The case drew international attention , especially online , and police later opted to drop the charges . Police also concluded that Gannon 's complaint against the detective was justified .  It is illegal to videotape a conversation without the person 's permission . However , Gannon believes he has a right to record in a public place .  Undeterred by the events , Gannon still carries a camcorder -- the exact same type as the one police seized .  Patrick Meighan can be reached at 594-6518 or **28;0;TOOLONG
