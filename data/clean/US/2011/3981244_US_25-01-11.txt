Why Women Walk Out More Than Men

why women walk out more than men  i had been following the on-again , off-again , on-again divorce of sean penn and robin wright for a while , not because i 'm celeb crazed but because before penn took off for haiti and wright to l.a. , they lived just a few miles from me . i sometimes would see wright around town , looking like any other san francisco bay area yummy mommy shopping at whole foods or checking out the guitars at the local music shop , just much more famous and a heck of a lot richer .  so when i read penn 's complaint to the hollywood reporter a few weeks ago that he 'd been " taken for one half of everything i had in the divorce , " i had to laugh -- " well , what did you expect , if you carry on like that ? " -- and i had a flashback to my own divorce a few years prior .  like wright , there were affairs and other shenanigans . like wright , we was the one who finally said , " i want a divorce " -- the hardest words i ever had to say . and , like penn , my then-husband was dumbfounded -- " you 're leaving me ? "  yes , i was , and that 's because he was doing everything that looked like leaving me except the actual leaving part .  men , evidently , do n't leave .  as it turns out , it 's -- sadly -- the only thing wright and i do share , but it 's something we have in common with a lot of other marital splits . women ask for divorce two-thirds more often than men . but it is n't so much because the wives woke up one day and " fell out of love " or realized they had " different values or lifestyles , " as many 50-something men who initiated divorce told aarp in a survey a few years back .  no , something else is clearly happening . it may be true that men do n't leave but you have to look wisely said , " the truth is more important than the facts . "  so what is going on ?  according to the national marriage project , formerly at rutgers university , now at the university of virginia , a lot :  " two-thirds of all divorces are initiated by women . one recent study found that many of the reasons for this have to do with the nature of our divorce laws . for example , in most states women have a good chance of receiving custody of their children . because women more strongly want to keep their children with them , in states where there is a presumption of shared custody with the husband the percentage of women who initiate divorces is much lower . also , the higher rate of women initiators is probably due to the fact that men are more likely to be " badly behaved . " husbands , for example , are more likely than wives to have problems with drinking , drug abuse , and infidelity . "  last year proved to be a bumper crop of " elin nordegren , and eva longoria . but if the gals did n't file for divorce , would jesse , tiger , or tony have dumped them and perhaps shacked up with the other woman -- or , in some cases , women ? probably not .  a few authors who 've paid attention to those sorts of things cite some rather pathetic statistics that " the other woman " should pay attention to : about 3 percent of cheating men marry their lovers , according to jan halper ( quiet desperation : the truth about successful men ) and about 75 percent of those marriages end up in divorce , according to frank pitman ( private lies : infidelity and the betrayal of intimacy ) .  so , is it a case of guys having their cake and eating it , too ? i do n't know , but there does seem to be some sort of disconnect between actions and reactions .  of course , affairs are n't the only reason women file for divorce more than men . and penn certainly is n't the only n't have to work " ; men lose a lot in divorce , not just money and houses , but often access to their kids . that 's not ok , either .  still , you 'd think that sober reality alone would be enough to shape up all that " bad " behavior . instead , what it 's probably doing is keeping a lot of young men from wanting to get married in the first place ; with about half of marriages ending in divorce , saying " i do " is a big financial gamble for them .  and , sure , there are many , many " badly behaved " women out there . but at least if they cheat , most of them -- 55 percent , according to susan shapiro barash ( a passion for more : wives reveal the affairs that make or break their marriages ) -- have the decency to leave .
