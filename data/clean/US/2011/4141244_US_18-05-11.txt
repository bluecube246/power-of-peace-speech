The incurable , hereditary neurological disorder is always fatal and affects one in 10,000 Americans . Huntington 's disease is caused by a renegade protein " huntingtin " that destroys neurons in areas of the brain concerned with the emotions , intellect and movement . All humans have the normal huntingtin protein , which is known to be essential to human life , although its true biological functions remain unclear .  Christopher Stanley , a Shull Fellow in the Neutron Scattering Science Division at ORNL , and Valerie Berthelier , a UT Graduate School of Medicine researcher who studies protein folding and misfolding in Huntington 's , have used a small-angle neutron scattering instrument , called Bio-SANS , at ORNL 's High Flux Isotope Reactor to explore the earliest aggregate species of the protein that are Berthelier , in research published today in Biophysical Journal , were able to determine the size and mass of the mutant protein structures ? from the earliest small , spherical precursor species composed of two ( dimers ) and three ( trimers ) peptides ? along the aggregation pathway to the development of the resulting , later-stage fibrils . They were also able to see inside the later-stage fibrils and determine their internal structure , which provides additional insight into how the peptides aggregate .  " Bio-SANS is a great instrument for taking time-resolved snapshots . You can look at how this stuff changes as a function of time and be able to catch the structures at the earliest of times , " Stanley said . " When you study several of these types of systems with different glutamines or different conditions , you begin to learn more and more about the nature of these aggregates and how they begin forming . "  Normal huntingtin contains a region of 10 to 20 glutamine amino acids in succession . However , the DNA of Huntington 's disease patients encodes for that contain this abnormally long glutamine repeat . Consequentially , the mutant protein fragment can not be degraded normally and instead forms deposits of fibrils in neurons .  Those deposits , or clumps , were originally seen as the cause of the devastation that ensues in the brain . More recently researchers think the clumping may actually be a kind of biological housecleaning , an attempt by the brain cells to clean out these toxic proteins from places where they are destructive . Stanley and Berthelier set out to learn through neutron scattering what the toxic proteins were and when and where they occurred .  At the HFIR Bio-SANS instrument , the neutron beam comes through a series of mirrors that focus it on the sample . The neutrons interact with the sample , providing data on its atomic structure , and then the neutrons scatter , to be picked up by a detector . From the data the detector sends of the scattering pattern , researchers can deduce at a scale of less than billionths of a meter the size and shape of the diseased , aggregating protein SANS was able to distinguish the small peptide aggregates in the sample solution from the rapidly forming and growing larger aggregates that are simultaneously present . In separate experiments , they were able to monitor the disappearance of the single peptides , as well as the formation of the mature fibrils .  Now that they know the structures , the hope is to develop drugs that can counteract the toxic properties in the early stages , or dissuade them from taking the path to toxicity . " The next step would be , let 's take drug molecules and see how they can interact and affect these structures , " Stanley said .  For now , the researchers believes Bio-SANS will be useful in the further study of Huntington 's disease aggregates and applicable for the study of other protein aggregation processes , such as those involved in Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases .  " That is the future hope . Right now , we feel like we are making a positive contribution towards that goal , " Stanley said .
