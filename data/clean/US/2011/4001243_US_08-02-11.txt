Trees shade a path out to an observation deck Tuesday afternoon near Mitchelville Beach on Hilton Head Island . Plans are being discussed to turn the area into a memorial park to commemorate the former Mitchelville , the first freed men 's village in the United States . SARAH WELLIVER/ The Island Packet  The Mitchelville Preservation Project held the first of a two-day strategic planning session Tuesday on development of a planned park commemorating the nation 's first freedmen 's village .  Board members discussed ways to leverage political support , community engagement and " prime " location to overcome the need for funding in a down economy against competing community needs , including finding a title sponsor for the Heritage golf tournament .  More than 30 people from the nonprofit 's board of directors and advisors gathered at the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton Chamber of Commerce to discuss goals and objectives for moving forward .  " The implications of this project are enormous , " said Susan Thomas , vice president of the chamber 's visitor and convention bureau . " This is -- a beacon of freedom . "  At the same time , need for staff and lack of knowledge of Mitchelville 's historical significance beyond Hilton Head and South Carolina present large obstacles .  " Most people think Hilton Head was founded in the 1950s by ( Sea Pines founder ) Charles Fraser , " said board member Heather Rath .  Infrastructure is also an issue .  " There are unpaved road around Mitchelville . We have to begin to put in the necessary infrastructure so people will feel comfortable going in to necessary areas , " said David White , an advisor to the board .  Chairman Thomas Barnwell , Jr . said such frank discussion is needed to lay out a workable plan for seeing the project to fruition , and is confident many of the issues will be addressed .  The Hilton Head Island Town Council agreed in September to lease 15 acres of town-owned land at Fish Haul Creek Park to develop the Mitchelville Project , contingent on a plan showing the preservation group 's financial ability to build and maintain $1 a year for 99 years , an arrangement similar to one between the town and the Coastal Discovery Museum at Honey Horn .  Town Council also awarded the preservation group $35,000 in bed tax money to help defray start-up costs . The group has established a beginning budget of $89,000 for salaries , consultant fees , rent , office operations , advertising , training and maintaining a new website .  Another estimated $60,000 to $80,000 is needed to complete an ecological and archeological survey . Board members said they hope to begin that process within the next two months .  " That is a key first step we need to accomplish before anything else can happen ; before we can move forward with architectural and site plans , " said board member Ezra Callahan . " That is going to require fundraising . We are moving ahead , but to continue that momentum , we need financial support . "  The group has more than $50,000 , including a grant of $10,000 from the Community Foundation of the Lowcountry , with a promise of $27,000 more , if matched .  Cost to develop the first phase of the park on town-owned land is estimated at $4.5 million . Construction would hopefully start in June 2012 and last a year , Callahan said .  Mitchelville was created for freed slaves in 1862 , before the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and a year after Union ships drove Confederate troops from Hilton Head Island .
