the 10 worst family films of all time  in 2011 , the family film is a staple of the standard cineplex experience . from anthropomorphic animals and objects to low brow live action lessons in caring and sharing , hollywood can churn out the kiddie chum with shocking regularity . every week , a new affront to taste and future therapist 's visits . perhaps even more astonishing is the public 's -- or make that , parent 's -- lack of consideration in making choices for their wee ones . they will literally buy almost anything , just as long as it has the requisite amount of slapstick and stupidity to keep their offspring out of their hair for a while . as an ersatz babysitter , the pg to g rated entertainment has gone from being amiable to merely available . as a result , picking ten examples of cinema 's worst is a lot like shuffling cg penguins around a ritzy manhattan apartment ... possible , but not a very pleasant experience overall .  in creating our list , we had to n't consider the animated film when compiling this list . noxious cartoons are their own stagnant slice of hell . similarly , we did n't scour the shelves for knock-offs , clear copyright infringements like ratatoing or the little panda fighter , which leads to another category we tried to avoid . bless them for their advances in style and concept , but the foreign film community can surely stink up the joint with their jaded , often harsh family fare . from the aforementioned mr. popper and his pooping water fowl ( in theaters now ! ) to something like thunderpants ( about a kid gifted with the ability to fart really well ... no seriously ) , there are plenty of regular choices to choose from . in this case , we guarantee that all ten will challenge your view of viable kid vid material , as well as your will to live .  #10 : ghost dad ( 1990 )  in the ' 90s , comedian turned ultimate tv dad bill cosby was seen as capable of doing absolutely no wrong . granted , his last but this uniformly terrible family film was -- hard to believe -- much , much worse . the tale of a workaholic widower desperate to make sure his kids are taken care of , even after a fatalistic cab rides banishes him to the afterlife , it 's a cloying combination of heart-tugging and sour slapstick . perhaps the most shocking thing about this supernatural comedy is that sydney poitier was sitting the director 's chair . horror !  #9 : santa with muscles ( 1996 )  unlike many famous athletes who really have no business being up on the big screen , a wrestler like hulk hogan should have been a cinematic natural . after all , his entire career was built on successfully selling a grateful , gullible audience on the ' fact ' that his sport was ' real ' . however , his efforts in front of the camera , including the atrocious mr. nanny and suburban commando argued for a stilted , steroided stiff . naturally , the next step was stupid , saccharine seasonal fare with the hulkster playing amnesiac to a group did n't deserve this steamy , stinking bag of coal .  #8 : the garbage pail kids movie ( 1987 )  how do you celebrate a ripe kid 's fad just waiting to be translated to the silver screen ? why , you turn the property over to a guy who 'd done little of significance since the many loves of dobie gillis and then hire has-been anthony newley as your leading man . in addition , waste most of your limited budget on creepy costumes which barely resemble the famed collector 's card characters and then add in a bullied human boy to really up the ick factor . aside from the often surreal visage of little people playing oversized cartoon caricatures , the real revelation comes from the movie 's rude and crude single digit iq messages .  #7 : kazaam ( 1996 )  speaking of athletes who should n't be allowed in front of craft services table ... when he abandoned orlando for the sunny celebrity climes of la , shaquille o'neal wanted to be more than an nba superstar . aside from an sadly , o'neal had all the presence of lebron james during a decisive game 6 . playing a genie who wants to help an obnoxious little brat reconnect with his dad , he 's about as believable as the miami heat 's big three 's chances at multiple championships . even the less than special effects argue for something that should have been quickly folded up and forgotten .  #6 : the country bears ( 2002 )  you ca n't talk about lousy family films and not send a little karmic creosote disney 's way , right ? after all , the house of mouse more or less invented the crappy kids movie during those depressing dog days of the 1970s ( super dad ? gus ? ) . in this case , the company was trying to parlay their famed theme park rides into substantial film franchises . in the case of this moronic costumed creature feature , nothing worked . the suits looks stupid . the casting was questionable and , worse of all , the actual attraction was cast aside for more formulaic flotsam . in more nuance and acting ability than the stiffs here .  since deciding to employ his underdeveloped muse muscles over five years ago , bill has been a significant staff member and writer for three of the web 's most influential websites : dvd talk , dvd verdict and , of course , popmatters . he also has expanded his own web presence with bill gibron.com a place where he further explores creative options . it is here where you can learn of his love of swindon 's own xtc , skim a few chapters of his terrifying tome in the making , the big book of evil , and hear samples from the cassette albums he created in his college music studio , the scream room .
