<p> When Douglas Maugans is plagued by nightmares of war , he can always count on Tanner to wake him up . <p> View full sizeBeth Anne Heesen , The Patriot-NewsDouglas Maugans of Mechanicsburg , who has post-traumatic stress disorder , worked in air traffic control with the Army National Guard . He has a special bond with Tanner , whom he taught to be a service dog with training from Helping Hounds . <p> The 5-year-old English springer spaniel presses the touch pad on Maugans ' nightstand with his nose to turn the light on , gets up on his master 's chest and lies there for as long as he 's needed . <p> Two years ago , Tanner became a medical service dog through Helping Hounds , a program sponsored by the Central Pennsylvania Animal Alliance of Mechanicsburg , which works out of an airplane hanger at the Capital City Airport in Fairview Township . <p> Maugans saved Tanner from a rescue shelter in New Orleans four years ago , and now Tanner was ready to save his master . <p> After a year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like he was n't a person anymore . He left home as the mayor of Marysville in 1999 and returned in 2000 with PTSD . <p> He spent almost three years in a Veteran Affairs hospital , got out in 2009 and moved to Mechanicsburg . <p> Fear of being in crowds kept him " living like a hermit " in his house . He often had panic attacks , and his night terrors were so bad that he did n't know night from day because of his rocky sleep schedule . <p> " Tanner transformed my life to the point where I became socialized again . I got involved with the VFW , do my own shopping and visit veterans in the hospital . " <p> Tanner learned to get in and out of buses and how to behave in an elevator . He learned to walk beside Maugans ' cart at the grocery store and resist temptation to grab items from shelves . <p> If Maugans is in line or in a crowd of people -- where hyper-vigilance kicks in and he is easily startled -- Tanner stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes within 5 or 10 feet . <p> " When you 're with your dog , it takes the focus off you , " Maugans said . <p> Most people do n't realize that he has a disability , so Tanner is the icebreaker that allows him to talk about it . <p> " People see his vest and say , ' Are you training him to be a service dog ? ' and I say , ' No , he is my service dog . ' To be able to talk about it at least on the surface is important . " <p> With Tanner as his service dog , Maugans no longer needs to take anxiety and sleep meds , which helped in the past but put him in a fog . <p> " The reason why dogs chew things up and destroy your house is that they do n't have a job to do , " said Joan Klingler , a volunteer trainer for Helping Hounds . " They have a phenomenal amount of energy , and a walk around the block just is n't enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " homework " Helping Hounds gives him . <p> " I have to train him , and if I fail I 'd be letting not only myself down but also my dog , " he said . <p> Kelly McGinley , who started the program in 2009 , said the dogs give the vets the sense of camaraderie that they had with other soldiers in combat . <p> Maugans takes Tanner with him to visit hospitalized vets . To know that he can encourage others who go through the same things he does is the greatest achievement . <p> " If it was n't for Tanner , I 'm 100 percent sure I would have been back in the hospital . He saved my life .
