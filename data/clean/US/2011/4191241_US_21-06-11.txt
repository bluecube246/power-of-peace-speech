<h> Got a hot tip ? tell us about it ! <h> Six questions hoteliers should ask providers of cloud-based systems <p> IBM did just that and surveyed 3,000 of them in its 2011 IBM Global CIO study , which found that CIO interest in cloud computing notched the greatest category increase compared with results from its survey two years earlier . <p> And , if you consider virtualization -- when virtual servers are created on a single piece of hardware -- part of a private cloud strategy , and you should , then interest is even greater in cloud technologies than the chart indicates . <p> However , in most cases , I would n't expect to see hoteliers deploy their own cloud instances , but they are more likely to use CRS , PMS and RMS systems via a Software-as-a-Service model . Cloud/SaaS can bring many advantages over on-premise solutions for hoteliers . Among them : <p> Access to the latest version without the pain often associated with upgrades ; <p> Removal of the burden of application and infrastructure management ; and <p> Potential for heightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry voice concerns regarding availability , security and disaster recovery . And , Wolfe notes that part of HFTP 's role is to help educate its members about the pros and cons of cloud computing and help eliminate misinformation , which fuels fear , uncertainty and doubt . <p> I understand that hoteliers worry about being cut off from their PMS and not being able to check in guests , or their CRS and not being able to take reservations , which can be disastrous given that room nights are a perishable good . Further , I can understand how events such as cloud outages and the ensuing headlines can fan the flames . <p> The cloud does not fix poorly designed applications automagically , but good software design and architecture can address availability and security issues and it must take the computing environment into consideration . <p> But in evaluating whether to choose a cloud/SaaS solution over on premise you also need to do an honest evaluation of your own IT organization 's ability to manage your infrastructure . Google 's cloud-based Gmail service offers 99.984% availability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation . <p> In addition , the cloud is being used by the federal government and financial institutions , both of which likely have stricter , more complicated regulatory requirements than most hotels . <p> And , major cloud platforms offer better physical and network security than virtually all hotel chains can provide . These examples show that the cloud is not inherently less secure or less available than on premise solutions . <p> So , that being said , what are the six questions that you should ask hospitality software suppliers about their cloud offering , whether you 're at HITEC or not : <p> 1 . Is it really cloud ? You may think this a bit pedantic , but there is an awful lot of cloud-washing going on in the enterprise software business , so there 's no reason to think that hospitality software should be any different . There is so much buzz about " the cloud " that some may use the term while not implementing their solution in a public cloud manner . Some may simply be offering a hosted model in their own datacenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like virtualization , but this is not necessarily the same thing . Some of the key aspects of real cloud offerings include : infinite bi-directional elasticity ; pay for what you use ; and detailed monitoring and reporting ( governance ) <p> 2 . Do you have Service Level Agreements on RTO/RPO ? OK , let 's start with a few definitions . RTO is Recovery Time Objective and RPO is Recovery Point Objective . These are critical disaster recovery attributes . Bascially they translates into how fast will you get my application back up and how far back in time are you backing up my data . If vendors do n't have SLAs on RPO then they 're likely not using continuous data protection techniques and you have a greater risk of losing data if the app crashes . <p> 3 . What are the availability SLAs ? It 's one thing to quote uptime in marketing materials , but at some point you have to put your money where your mouth is . The penalties never truly make up for the loss of service , but it gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for how you should evaluate that performance against an existing solution . <p> 4 . Is there an offline mode ? Just because something is cloud-based does n't mean it only works when you 're online . There are techniques that can enable some level of offline functionality and then automatically synchronize when you 're back online . <p> 5 . What about integration ? A PMS or a CRS have to talk with other solutions , whether it be restaurant , golf facility , spa or accounting systems . One of the challenges in the early days of SaaS in the enterprise was that it was difficult to knit together different systems . Some companies build their own integrations , others use platforms like Boomi ( acquired by Dell last year ) . But you need to find out what systems they integrate with automatically and check that against the other systems that you need to connect with . If there are gaps , ask the company how it will help you close them . <p> 6 . How can I get my data back out ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will gladly tell you how easy it is to get onboard , but rarely are they forthcoming about how you can get your data back out . Some refer to this as data portability . It 's critically important as you may need to change systems if you change flags or if you just do n't like the way the platform works . Be sure you are comfortable with the flexibility provided . <p> Cloud computing can be a very useful tool for hoteliers . But before you make the move , be sure that you ask the right questions and get the right answers when choosing a platform . <p> Hi Glean , i agree with your 6 points . Especially in the first point you have raised a important question that is " is it really cloud " , cause as a Hotel Management software provider hoteliers mostly ask us the different between cloud based and web based hospitality management software . <p> A good piece and I agree with Glenn , not just restricted to hoteliers in the travel industry . These questions apply just as much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in questions pertaining to the security of data . Especially in light of the recent data loss by giants like Sony . <p> These are great questions but are not just limited to hoteliers . I think it would be safe to say that any business considering porting to a cloud based SaaS should be asking these key questions . Thanks Glenn .
