According to the government , a group of about 50 inmates out of 1,000 is behind the resistance . <p> Authorities had already raided another prison , Rodeo I , and seized a number of weapons , drugs and cell phones . Two troops and one inmate were killed in that raid , officials said . <p> On Monday night , a national guard contingent rescued 36 inmates from the " mafias " that have control of Rodeo II , the state-run AVN news agency reported . Eleven were injured in the operation . <p> The operations at the Rodeo prison complex come a week after a prison riot that left 22 dead .

The video , which was aired by Venezuelan news outlet Reportero 24 , shows what appears to be the inside of a prison filmed by one of the inmates . <p> The date the video was shot and the location where it was shot were not verified . <p> In the video , two white freezers are shown and opened . Inside each , there is one body . <p> " We have to keep them in the freezer , so they do n't rot , " the narrator says . He describes the bodies as " two of the compatriots who have died in the fight . " <p> If indeed both of the deceased are from inside one of the Rodeo prisons , it would increase the official death toll . <p> As the video pans away from the freezers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrator blames officials for firing on the inmates . <p> " Listen !

The rule of authority had deteriorated so much there , the paper found , that it " looks more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The prisoners there run the show , one inmate told the paper . <p> Among the problems that the commission cited were inmates ' possession of weapons , extortion of inmates , overcrowding and lack of medical care . <p> The Inter-American Commission has repeatedly recommended -- and reaffirmed after last week 's riot -- reducing the overcrowd conditions , confiscating weapons , and establishing a division between those who are being prosecuted and those who have been convicted . The commission also recommended better trained guards and better investigations into acts of violence inside the prisons .
