<p> Brenda Jennetta , 70 , of Spring Hill , Fla. , joins a handful of " Occupy " protesters in downtown Brooksville , Fla . We checked a Facebook Post that charged that members of Congress are disproportionately wealthy . <p> Over the past two months , the Occupy Wall Street movement has spread to cities around the country , and those other movements are busy putting out messages that protest against income inequality . <p> A reader recently sent us an example from Facebook , which was an online message credited to Occupy D.C. The posting says : <p> " 1 percent of Americans are millionaires . " <p> " 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires . " <p> " 56 percent of Senators are millionaires . " <p> " What would the country be like if our representative government was actually representative ? " <p> The reader asked us to check it out , and we were curious ourselves if the division of wealth between the country as a whole and our elected leaders was quite that stark . So we decided to unpack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . <p> " 1 percent of Americans are millionaires . " <p> A millionaire is a person whose net worth is $1 million or more . Net worth is cash , home value , stocks , bonds and other property minus any debts owed . <p> The Federal Reserve Board conducts a Survey of Consumer Finances every three years . Its last survey was in 2007 , with an update in 2009 . The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute analyzed that data and determined that the average wealth of the top 1 percent was close to $14 million in 2009 , down from $19.2 million in 2007 ( in part because of a decline in housing values ) . Still , many in the top 1 percent clearly were multimillionaires . <p> A 2011 study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services estimated there are around 10.5 million households in the U.S. in 2011 with net worth of more than $1 million . <p> That 's around 9 percent of all households , which is far larger than 1 percent . <p> If you measure how many individuals have incomes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the mark . <p> The Internal Revenue Service recently released income statistics for 2009 . It found the top 1 percent of the country included people who made adjusted gross income $343,927 and up . But adjusted gross income can leave out some types of income , particularly types of income not subject to tax . <p> For a fuller pictures , we turned to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . It created an economic analysis of total cash income for 2011 , not just taxable or adjusted income . The center found that the top 1 percent in 2011 had an average income of $1.5 million a year . However , some elites made slightly less the a million . The least wealthy of the top 1 percent had cash income of $532,613 . <p> Interesting , but income only does n't define millionaires . <p> " 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires . 56 percent of Senators are millionaires . " <p> Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate are paid $174,000 annually , with leadership positions paid slightly more . But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial net worth . <p> Members of the House and Senate are required to file financial disclosures that include their assets and liabilities , and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics compiles those disclosures . <p> The representatives and senators are not required to disclose precisely how much they are worth , but they do have to indicate a range of amounts for their assets and liabilities . The center calculates the midpoint between these high and low estimates , then uses that midpoint to rank-order lawmakers from richest to least rich . <p> According to the center 's most recent analysis , 183 members of the House had a midpoint net worth estimate of at least $1 million . Meanwhile , the center calculated that 67 senators had a midpoint net worth estimate of $1 million or higher . These numbers were for the calendar year 2010 . <p> The wealthiest member of Congress was Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , the head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . " Issa 's minimum estimated net worth in 2010 was $195 million , while his maximum estimated net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in its analysis . The midpoint estimate in that range is $448 million . <p> Rep. Alcee Hastings , D-Fla. , is the least wealthy member of Congress . Hastings ' liabilities exceed his assets ; the center reported that his minimum estimated net worth is negative $7.3 million while his maximum estimated net worth is negative $2.1 million . <p> The median net worth of House members was an estimated $756,765 , while the median net worth of a senator was $2.63 million . <p> So , using these estimates -- and remember , these are only estimates -- 42 percent of House members are millionaires , while 67 percent of senators are millionaires . <p> Our ruling <p> The Facebook posting from Occupy D.C. said , " 1 percent of Americans are millionaires . 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires . 56 percent of Senators are millionaires . " One recent study found that around 9 percent of all U.S. households have net assets of more than $1 million . So the claim on Facebook significantly understates the wealth of individuals . <p> It 's closer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans has an average income of $1.5 million . But the relevant figure would be net worth . <p> As for members of Congress , the most recent estimate shows that 42 percent of House members and 67 percent of senators are millionaires in net worth . That means the Facebook post is a bit high in its estimate of House millionaires and a bit low in its estimate of Senate millionaires . <p> The numbers support the underlying point of the Facebook post -- that members of Congress are disproportionately wealthy . But not on the scale suggested . We rate the Facebook post Half True .
