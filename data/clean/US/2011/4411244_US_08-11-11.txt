<h> First-ever nationwide test of Emergency Alert System set for Wednesday <p> By Mike M. Ahlers , CNN <p> Updated 6:29 PM ET , Tue November 8 , 2011 <h> Story highlights <p> All previous tests of the network have been local or regional , and optional <p> Wednesday 's test will include a live " presidential " alert code , giving it priority <p> People who can not hear their cable TV 's sound will not know it is only a test <p> " This is a test . This is only a test . " <p> When millions of Americans hear that warning at 2 p.m . ET Wednesday , the words will sound familiar , but the occasion will be historic . It will mark the first-ever nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System , a system with Cold War roots that enables the president to address the American public within 10 minutes from any location at any time . <p> Although state and local communities regularly use the system to notify communities about tornadoes , child abductions and other events , all previous tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve the voluntary compliance of broadcasters . Wednesday 's test is the first national test featuring a live " presidential " alert code , which instructs TV and radio stations that the alert takes priority over all other programming . <p> " I think the biggest reason nobody ever tested it was because of all the concerns of what could happen and what could go wrong , " Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Craig Fugate told CNN Tuesday . " We take a different approach . If we do n't test it , we do n't know what we need to fix . " <p> Officials at FEMA and at the Federal Communications Commission , which ordered the test , expect things to go smoothly . <p> But there are concerns . Chief among them : cable television systems are worried the test will unduly alarm deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers . That is because some cable systems , unlike broadcast and satellite TV , can not superimpose a visual warning saying " This is a test " over the government 's graphic . Instead , they will see only this scrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which gives no visual indication it is just a test . <p> Some critics also said the test is a stark reminder that -- 10 years after the September 11 terrorist attacks -- the nation is still living with an antiquated warning system in a digital world . <p> The test will air on every broadcast , cable and satellite TV station in the nation , as well as every AM , FM and satellite radio station . But it will not be sent to landline or cell phones , pagers or computers , which millions of people monitor for news and information . <p> The country has made strides in developing an integrated warning system featuring mobile devices , but for most Americans , those systems are years away . <p> And some experts question whether the warning system has much value at the national level . <p> In a local emergency such as a gas leak , emergency management expert Art Botterell notes , the system enables authorities to tell the homeowners to stay inside or to evacuate . " But if the message is nationwide , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> The system was not used during the September 11 terrorist attack , Botterell noted . But it remains , at a national level , a symbol of the president 's authority and responsibility , he said . <p> " I think the bottom line is everybody prays to God that we do n't have to use it , because if we do , whether it works or not will probably be the least of everybody 's worries . " <p> Blink and you 'll miss it <p> The test will be brief -- 30 seconds from start to finish . <p> In the event of a real emergency , the test would originate from wherever the president is . For test purposes , it will originate from a FEMA operations center . The president will not be involved and will not speak . <p> But to duplicate real-world conditions , FEMA will initiate the test by sending a " live " presidential alert code , a code that would be used in an actual emergency , to a number of radio stations known as Primary Entry Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information in a daisy chain fashion to other radio and television stations . <p> When a station receives the alert , it must discontinue normal programming and make its transmission lines available for the presidential message . <p> Under the Emergency Alert System agreement , participating stations agree to carry the message , but they have the option of signing off the air . <p> In some systems , the presidential alert automatically interrupts programming ; at other stations , a switch is made manually . <p> At the end of the message , a termination signal is sent to stations allowing them to return to normal programming . <p> After Wednesday 's test , stations must report the results to the FCC within 45 days . The FCC says it will not release test data to the public , saying broadcasters worry that potentially embarrassing results could discourage participation in future tests , and test data could reveal security vulnerabilities . <p> Concerns about confusion <p> Not everyone says the system is ready for a test . <p> Three weeks ago , the National Cable and Telecommunications Association asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of cable households will not see an on-screen message that ' this is a test . ' " <p> Instead , the on-screen text will simply state : " This is an Emergency Action Notification , " and in some cases , " for the United States " or " for the District of Columbia " depending upon the equipment . <p> " This raises the possibility that some viewers , particularly the deaf and hard-of-hearing , could mistakenly believe that the test is an actual national emergency , " NCTA President Michael Powell wrote . <p> Broadcasters and satellite TV providers may be able to superimpose a message that a " test " is being conducted , Powell wrote , but cable distributors generally do not have such equipment in place . <p> " The most prudent course would be to postpone the national test until better functionality exists in the EAS system to visually indicate that it is a test , " Powell wrote . <p> The FCC responded by limiting the duration of the test to 30 seconds to " reduce any potential disruptions " and minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEMA also started a public outreach campaign to notify the hearing impaired , senior citizens , people with mental health issues and people with limited English skills . <p> But reducing the length of the test means one feature of the system can not be tested . <p> " Under the rules , the president can interrupt ( a broadcast ) and speak as long as they want , " Botterell said . " But in the case of other ( non-presidential ) messages , there is a two-minute limit . " So there is " lurking fear " that some equipment may be programmed to cut off emergency alerts after two minutes , he said . <p> Reducing the test to 30 seconds will mean those systems will not be detected , although they are believed to be few and far between , he said . <p> Establishing a benchmark <p> The FCC says the test will establish a benchmark against which future progress can be measured . <p> " It 's a benchmark that should have been done over a decade ago , " said Richard Rudman , vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We need to shake out some of the distribution points to see what works and what does n't , " Rudman said . " I do not believe it is going to cause panic in the streets . " <p> He said problems could have been avoided if the FCC had required equipment upgrades sooner . " We 've known about this for over a decade , " he said . <p> Experts say the Emergency Alert System being tested Wednesday is unlike the system that Americans will someday use , which will allow messages to be transmitted through TVs , radios , mobile phones , pagers and other means . But change has come slowly , some say . <p> " We 've been nine months away from the ( integrated system ) for about five years now , " Botterell said . " It has slipped continually . " <p> But FEMA 's Fugate is optimistic . <p> Tests are already being conducted in New York City of devices that receive emergency alerts , and they will become more commonplace as new technology replaces the old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the next year and in other locations , it may be another year or two . But it 's coming , " Fugate said .
