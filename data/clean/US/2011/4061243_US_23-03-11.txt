Once married , Taylor and second husband Michael Wilding began a haphazard house hunt that involved purchasing a Beverly Hills home in the summer of 1952 for $75K -- $600K in today 's dollars -- and spending another $40K sprucing it up , before abandoning the house two years later for the comfort of an even more opulent home at 1375 Beverly Estate Drive(above) . She and Wilding decided to buy after scaling the fence surrounding the property for an impromptu open house .

Since the early ' 80s , Taylor had been living in this stealthy two-story in Bel Air , Calif . Shrouded in trees and located at the end of a long driveway , the private home looks to be a fitting getaway for the aging starlet .
