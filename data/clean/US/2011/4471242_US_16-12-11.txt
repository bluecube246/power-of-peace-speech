<h> Got a hot tip ? tell us about it ! <h> IATA found in breach of regulations over use of PaxIS , Europe data to be removed <p> A rather big and messy storm of a story has taken another twist in Europe after IATA was found in breach of flight data regulations on its PaxIS product . <p> The global airline representative body was informed by the European Commission on November 25 ( but details and confirmation have only emerged this week ) that it had breached the CRS Code of Conduct and all European travel agent data must be removed from the PaxIS tool . <p> PaxIS is a product developed by IATA to provide airline passenger market intelligence and real-time data , covering ticket information on over 400 airlines and captured using the the Billing and Settlement Plan ( BSP ) . <p> Included in the data is passenger and ticket information from agencies such as fare value , point of origin , connection and destination airport , category or class or seat , etc . <p> The system , however , rivals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the GDSs , a tool which essentially does the same thing , allowing for in-depth forecasting , planning and revenue management and , once again , uses data from agents . <p> But herein lies the problem and source of the latest shenanigans . <p> MIDT , by virtue of it being run by the GDSs , has always come under the auspices of the European Code of Conduct which regulates the role and operations of Amadeus , Travelport and Sabre . This meant that agencies needed to give the GDSs permission to use the data within the system . <p> IATA did not have to ask permission when it launched PaxIS , namely because it is n't a GDS and is using the data from within its own BSP system . <p> The European Commission has now decided otherwise . <p> The latest twist , however , ends ( for the time beging ) what has been a two-year investigation by European officials into whether PaxIS ( and , by extension , IATA ) should be included in the GDS Code of Conduct , a probe which started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an additional complaint from some agencies in September 2009 . <p> Following the EC decision in November , IATA has been told to remove data relating to all passengers from European travel agents . <p> IATA still claims the volume of tickets in the PaxIS database will not be reduced and geographical identification of European ticket sales will remain in the system . The detailed passenger information will be out . <p> An official says : <p> " We continue to believe that the European CRS Code of Conduct should not apply to IATA ( a trade association ) or to its PaxIS product ( which derives its data through the BSP system ) . <p> " IATA is now working with the European Commission to clarify IATA 's views . Obviously , IATA will comply with all regulations in the jurisdictions within which it operates . IATA is acting in good faith and currently exploring what steps need to be taken for compliance in the short-term . <p> " In the longer-term we are looking to solutions that will allow PaxIS to be restored to its full capability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " IATA remains committed to providing a competitive option to MIDT data so that the market for such products is not monopolized by GDSs .

He has a degree in criminology , a postgraduate diploma in magazine journalism and will be publishing his first book - a biography about electronic band , Depeche Mode - soon . <p> There is an interesting argument here . IATA may not be subject to European Commission ( EC ) Rules . But that was not a battle that either of them have chosen to undertake and probably wisely so . <p> IATA as a Supra-National organization has certain rights and is excempt from certain jurisdictions and sets of rules . <p> It is rather interesting that the complaints were filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some form or battle with IATA over the collection and provision of this data . IATA 's PAXIS data is comparable to ARC 's ticketing data in the USA . In my viewi it is of higher quality than MIDT data when it incorporates BSP ticketing data . ARC 's data provides much closer views of the market than that from the GDSs . Therefore one has to think the data is better quality . <p> The cost for all of them -- MIDT or PAXIS is still outrageous . <p> If the EC would like to do something more formal -- they should be investigating why after more than 20 years IATA still has not permitted BSP approved pan European ticketing by Travel Agents . <p> If the European Commission is serious about competition in the Travel marketplace , it needs to up its game in its compliance with various EU based directives which will improve the ability of sellers in travel to sell into the common market .
