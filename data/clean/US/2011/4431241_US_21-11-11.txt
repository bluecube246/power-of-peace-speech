the new challenge of leading financial firms  running a financial organization , never easy to begin with , has quickly become one of the most difficult leadership challenges that an executive can undertake , requiring mastery of talent management , change management , and ethics . an interview with professor boris groysberg , who teaches a new hbs executive education program on the subject with professor paul m. healy . key concepts include :  leading a financial firm is very different from leading any other kind of institution , requiring deep skills in a multitude of areas .  financial firms make expensive bets on top talent , but often make hiring decisions without enough deliberation .  risk management , strategy for growth , and competing in emerging markets are especially critical for financial firms to get right .  running a financial institution , never easy to begin with , has quickly become one of the most difficult leadership challenges that an executive can undertake , requiring mastery of talent management , change management , and ethics .  " the business today " -- paul m. healy  " the business today is much more complex than ten or twenty years ago , " said harvard business school professor paul m. healy in a recent interview . " the firms in the business have much more complexity in the types of the risks they are managing , in the types of diversity of the businesses they are in , in terms of how global they are . "  realizing that the headaches and rewards of these leaders are somewhat singular to their field , healy and colleague boris groysberg have created an hbs executive education program called leadership in financial organizations . combining a mix of case studies , lectures , and interactive exercises , the program is designed for high-level managers or executives at banks , insurance companies , asset management or private equity firms , or hedge funds . groysberg and healy will teach the program in england , in india , in china , and on the hbs boston campus throughout 2012 and 2013 .  " leading a financial institution is very different from leading any other kind become a leader in a manufacturing company , for example , all you 're basically going to have to do is manage . when you become a leader in a major financial institution , you must do several major things and do them really well . if you 're a trader , for example , you have to trade , you have to lead , and you have to manage . you have three jobs . "  one way leadership of a financial firm differs from others is in the emphasis that must be placed in recruiting and retaining talent .  " it always fascinates me how an investment banker who has spent months and months and months analyzing a particular deal between two companies can spend only a few minutes making a hiring decision for his team , when the firm is sometimes paying millions of dollars in guaranteed compensation , " groysberg says .  hiring and managing  talent acquisition , development , and retention is a key topic for financial firms that groysberg raises in his new book , chasing stars : the fact that from one firm to another . too often , managers fail to consider that a top performer 's success may have been due in large part to the culture of the previous organization ; hence , the type of person who thrived at goldman sachs might flounder at credit suisse .  but there 's a broader reason for performance declines : banks often do n't spend much time on training and development , a symptom of a general culture of impatience in the financial world .  " hiring is not an event . it 's a process " -- boris groysberg  " hiring is not an event , " groysberg says . " it 's a process . when that person arrives monday at eight o'clock , it 's just the beginning , but companies often spend zero time in integrating talented people . it used to be that we 'd let people take some time to learn the culture of a new organization , but it 's not like that anymore . our expectations are immediate : ' we 've paid you a lot of money , you doing something useful yet ? ' if the twentieth century was a learning century , then the twenty-first century is a performance century . "  in considering whether job performance is a matter of each person 's innate natural ability or a matter of how well a company trains its new employees , ceos often place too much weight on the former , groysberg argues . " even the best and the brightest can benefit from a nurturing environment , " he says . " you can turn a talented person into a superstar if you combine nature and nurture . "  that said , he adds , in the program there will be much discussion on compensation : short term versus long term , fixed versus variable , and how to disperse compensation fairly among the firm .  growth strategies , risk management , and globalization  other issues of importance to the leader of modern-day financial organizations to be discussed in the program include :  growth strategy . one key question financial leaders must decide is whether it is better to grow the organization people would be surprised by the batting averages of most institutions , " groysberg says . " so , so many acquisitions are not successful . "  risk management . even a cursory reading of recent headlines shows how vulnerable financial firms can be in this interrelated world , making risk management strategies crucial to success . " we 'll spend time talking about leading through crises and about what we have learned from recent events , " groysberg says . " we 'll look at how we can deal with it if we have to go through another crisis . considering what 's happening in europe , it 's a good time to start doing that . "  globalization . financial leaders must realize the increasing importance of doing business not only in new york , london , and tokyo , but in the emerging markets of india , china , and brazil as well . " i think many companies are realizing that their track record of going outside their home country is n't great , because , to be completely honest , not that many of someone who works in london , for instance , to attend our program in mumbai . it will let them be in a different environment and build different relationships . "  about the author  carmen nobel is the senior editor of hbs working knowledge .  post a comment  chirag swamy  manager pre-sales , animika studios  i believe that one of the biggest challenges that financial institutions face today is a ' trust deficit ' . a leader should ideally look at regaining public confidence for his firm and this can be achieved through concentrated , innovative marketing and advertising efforts . the bad pr that they have constantly been subjected to since 2008 needs to be reversed at the earliest .  zulkani sahin  after sale manager , psa peugeot citoren  i think that a very important factor among many is to obtain a cohesion from peers to indicate them the direction to take ( vision , goal ) . what makes the difference is the way how people in an organization have been involved and felt essantial in the strategy will create difficult situation .  anonymous  leaders have to fight in many fronts . to cite a few : financial services are becoming complex and more regulated . integration of major economies is adding exchange risk considerably . provison requirements are increasing due to international banking norms .  anonymous  indeed , modern financial institutions have become impatient organisations and the industry 's employment practices are clear evidence of this impatience as mentioned in your article .  perhaps the fast-moving and ever-demanding environment of financial markets have influenced the industry through time . in your view , what is your thought on solving the imbalance between expectation and results ( that may be the cause of impatience ) in the industry ?  anonymous  i agree that hiring and staff development is a critical process in financial organisations . a close analysis really confirms that the difference between firms is not so much its assets but its staff .  ravi parsi  director , kantech engineers pvt . ltd .  the present is very complicated world with greater integration of cultures , different styles of managing in the cross hairs of everybody in the management of organisations especially for financial firms and future will become even more complicated .  so the need for financial firm is more to depend upon to do what it knows to do and encourage the leaders &amp; their teams to stick to there own knitting . this will mean sometime your quarterly numbers will not be what the stock market wants ! ! !  this is the very great challenge in managing financial organisation to remove the focus from quarterly numbers to its main reason for existing in the financial world .  the complicated world will throw up newer ways of doing looking very attractive to make money in a difficult world . the challenge here is not to pressure the teams to take un-calculated risks without understanding the nature to new ways of doing . this is again possible if the focus is not on joneses making spectacular quarterly numbers by employing to newer ways of doing but to support &amp; encourage the team to learn and consider risks before taking the plunge and supporting them if they indeed ! ! ! !  shantha  director/lecturer , agape international  one of the greatest challenges is the management of emerging risks in a new business paradigm . some financial institutions , especially in emerging economies , still consider traditional borrowing and lending as their business . for example , identity fraud and hacking have become major risk factors and thus our risk models should also change accordingly . large investments in " managing new risks " is likely to increase the cost to income ration further .  suhas bindu  consultant , na  in my opinion , the most important challenge is to prioritize and focus on the business objectives.as a matter of fact , the firms must stay away from the greed of the business and lucrative opportunties without proper exercize . working on too many fronts in the financial world of random behaviour could hit the firm at a later stage  johanna lubahn  managing director , cohen brown management group  i agree with the complexity of managing and leading financial institutions as i work globally in this industry . the other in all areas and fast tracking changes that need to be implemented . not easy when at the top of the structure but doable as evidenced by some ceo 's who understand the power of their people , know how to engage them and motivate them around the vision  kapil kumar sopory  company secretary , smec(india) private limited  the level of responsibility cast on financial companies is very high as they deal directly with the money of their customers . they have to possess exemplary acumen to ensure their acceptability by acting cleanly . their misdemeanours come to the fore fast and they can not live through dubious means for long . responsibility is also cast on them on choosing right borrowers who have got to repay come what may . we need performing assets only and bad debts would come as sharp killers . this holds generally for other organisations too but since a financial firm - a bank for instance - lends its depositors ' money , it is to be ensured that the deposits are not frittered away for these have u8ltimately to be repayed .  anonymous  the industry has not been lead too fully understand the " threat " of its competition and with insufficient " risk management " processes . before we can " fix " it the hard truth about the situation needs to be understood and told . we must return to the basics and teach this next generation the true valule of how to evelate and underwrite risk .  regular simulation of stress testing ( based on very well defined and tough parameters taking care of risk aspects ) by any financial institution especially when the global scenario turns merkier is most important . with sudden change in the external environment and incumbent impact becomes capable of spoiling fortune of any robust financial compainy . secod comes ' value systems ' which is inculcated by the leader of the organisation . if both these aspects are there all other becomes subsidiary and could be retrofitted automatically . in developing economies like india if banks could survive the onslaught of 2008 global melt down it is only beause strong prudential norms and compliance . many privately financial companies meet . this is exacerbated equally by greedy clients looking forward astronomical higher returns not possible under given economic conditions ..
