<p> There may be some survival benefit to hiccups : In the process , the windpipe is closed off , according to Dr. Oz , so you ca n't breathe food particles into the lungs . <p> Albeit annoying , hiccups are rarely much of a health concern , and most of the time stop on their own in a matter of minutes . But in rare cases , hiccups have lasted longer -- and have even been signifiers of a more serious health issue . One patient hiccuped continually for 60 years , according to " Today . " A man who claimed to have hiccuped for three years straight was found to have a tumor pinching nerves that controlled his breathing , the Sun reported . And earlier this year , a man with a nonstop case of the hiccups was found to have actually suffered a small heart attack . <p> You likely have your own favorite method for getting rid of the hiccups when you really just ca n't wait them out . You probably even have a remedy you swear works 100 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's really only anecdotal evidence that any of these methods truly works . We asked Brian Udermann , Ph.D. , an exercise and sports science professor at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse and the author of " 25 Ways to Cure the Hiccups : Uncovering the Truth Behind 101 Common Myths and Misconceptions " to take a few guesses . <p> Close <p> ? <p> Get Rid Of Hiccups <p> of <p> ? <p> ? <p> There are seemingly endless hiccup remedies that involve some sort of alternate breathing method , from holding your breath to taking deep breaths to holding your breath while plugging your ears . " Anything you do in regard to your breath , it 's possible that you could disrupt that nerve impulse from the brain to the diaphragm so you stop the hiccups , " says Udermann . A little extra carbon dioxide may also help to relax the diaphragm , according to Dr. Oz , although we do n't know exactly why .

Swallowing -- which , when you think about it , is a temporary change in your breathing , says Udermann -- may override those diaphragm spasms , according to Reader 's Digest Canada . " It does n't matter if you drink upside down or sideways or from a spoon , " says Udermann . " It 's that act that could be disruptive . " Flickr photo by eschipul <p> " What works in our house is a teaspoon of sugar , " says Udermann . " You eat it , and they 're gone , 99 percent of the time . " Others swear by a spoonful of peanut butter or ice cream . We 've even heard biting into a slice of lemon coated in sugar and bitters can do the trick . But there 's not likely anything specific about the peanut butter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like with drinking and breathing tricks , eating has the potential to affect your breath and therefore your diaphragm , says Udermann . We ca n't help but remind you though that that spoonful of sugar is just that , a spoon full of sugar , and it counts , calorically . Women should aim to eat fewer than 5 teaspoons of sugar a day , men 9 and kids about 3 , so you might want to try other remedies first ! <p> When you stick out or even pull on your tongue , you stimulate a part of the throat connected to the nasal passage called the nasopharynx and the opening between the vocal cords , which may offer some relief .

It may also work as a mental distraction , which seems to quell hiccups . Want proof ? Have someone ask you to hiccup on the spot , and see what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suggests squeezing your palm -- hard -- to distract your nervous system away from hiccuping to the sensation of mild pain instead . This may work similarly to the way that slapping or pinching yourself can distract from an itchy mosquito bite .
