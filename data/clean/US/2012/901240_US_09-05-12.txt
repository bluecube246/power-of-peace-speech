But wait -- you 're about to be taken on a ride where you 'll see it grow , morph , undulate and still wo n't know quite what this confounding , " easily the most insane animal footage ever caught on an undersea camera " is .  Check it out :  As the film rolls on , the creature appears to be getting bigger . At 57 seconds what you saw flash by at the beginning of the footage reappears . Things start to get even more visually interesting when an organ of the creature ( or perhaps it 's dinner inside its gut ) comes into view around 1:51 . At this point , you also have a better view of the texture and pattern of the filmy organism 's exterior .  It 's hard to tell if it is moving itself or is dead and simply jellyfish is " imperfectly known " because specimens of it have been damaged . It is unclear where this original footage was actually taken , but according to the timestamp , it appears to have been recorded on April 25.
