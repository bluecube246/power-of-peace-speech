blind chef christine ha crowned ' masterchef ' in finale  from the moment she took those first tentative steps onto the national stage , chef christine ha captured america 's heart .  during monday night 's season 3 " masterchef " finale , ha won the title , $250,000 grand prize and a cookbook deal , beating out josh marks and about 100 other chefs . but that 's not what makes her so inspiring . ha is blind -- the first blind contestant on the show .  " i think there are a lot of people who completely discounted me , " ha told " nightline . " " they think i 'm there as a tv gimmick for ratings . people will say , ' what is she doing ? is she going to cut her finger off ? ' but i cook at home for years without vision , so if i can do it at home i do n't see why i ca n't prove to everyone else i can do it on national tv . "  week after on her graduate degree in creative writing , managed to whip up culinary masterpieces with only her sense of taste , smell and touch to guide her . the judges did allow her to use her aide , cindy , but she did not cut or taste ha 's food .  " she 's basically my eyes , " ha said .  aside from that , ha faced the same time constraints , the same stress and the same withering criticism from the other judges , including notoriously tough chef gordon ramsey of " hell 's kitchen " fame . she compared competing on " masterchef " to pledging a sorority .  " i could n't see what anyone else was doing , i was solely focused on myself , and i think that helped me . it gave me an advantage , " she said . " when i came out of it , it was most stressful intense experience of her life , it was amazing . "  ha said she is able to compete mainly because she was not born blind . she nearly being diagnosed with an auto-immune disease that attacks the optic nerves .  " i see shadows , " ha said . " i think the best way for me to describe it is , if you were to come out of a really hot shower and looked into a really steamy mirror , that fogginess is what i see . "  but ha , who has no professional culinary training , said she was determined not to let blindness force her to give it up .  " when i lost my vision , there was one time , i tried to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , " she said . " i recall getting it all over the counter . i just started crying and was wondering if i would ever cook again . "  but she did more than pick herself up off the counter . she started her own blog , theblindcook.com , which is how the producers of " masterchef " discovered her .  ha 's kitchen is decked out with a few special tools to help her along : , and oven mitts so large they look like they belong to an astronaut , but they keep her from getting burned .  but her favorite part of cooking is plating , the presentation of food , which ha does from memory .  " i do remember colors and i can visualize things , " she said . " i know i like to plate everything on white . the color pops out , looks better . "  " i picture the colors of food -- this needs some green , this needs some red , " she continued . " that 's how i think about garnish . i just feel my way through that plate and that 's how i present . "  now an official " masterchef , " ha said her next dream is to open her own ice cream store and a pub .  " i just want people to realize that they have it in themselves if they really want to , " she said . " if they have that passion , that fire , that drive , that to really achieve what you want and prove yourself to the world . everyone is very capable . much more capable than they think they are . "
