" the fact is i am quite happy in a movie , even a bad movie , " admits binx bolling , the hero of walker percy 's 1961 novel the moviegoer . it 's the same for a lot of us -- cinema affects us in ways we do n't always understand , and even the worst films appeal to our nostalgia and sense memories in manners that defy the normal rules of taste and logic . ( currently , on my dvr : la dolce vita , a classic i know i should see at some point , and gymkata , a truly terrible 1985 martial-arts flick i 've watched a dozen times . guess which one i 'm going to turn on tonight ? )  in the big screen , british-american film critic and historian david thomson attempts to answer some fundamental questions about the world 's favorite hobby . how do we relate to the movies ? " the cinema is the embodiment of ' let there be light , ' " he writes . but where does the light come from of course , these are difficult and possibly even unanswerable questions . but thomson -- arguably the world 's most intelligent student of the cinema -- proves remarkably up to the task . the big screen is beautiful and expansive , " a love letter to a lost love " that has the capacity to change the way we look at film .  thomson 's book is essentially a collection of new essays , covering movies from d.w. griffith 's brilliant but notoriously racist the birth of a nation to the critically reviled adam sandler " comedy " jack and jill . while there 's not an even remotely boring chapter in the book , the centerpiece of the volume is formed of two long essays , " sunset and change " and " film studies , " in which thomson jumps from topic to topic breathlessly , almost suddenly , but with transitions that somehow make more sense than they should .  david thomson is the author of more than 20 books , including have you seen ... ? : a personal introduction to 1,000 films and the and giroux hide caption  toggle caption lucy gray/farrar , straus and giroux  david thomson is the author of more than 20 books , including have you seen ... ? : a personal introduction to 1,000 films and the new biographical dictionary of film .  lucy gray/farrar , straus and giroux  it 's like listening for an hour to a smart , hyperactive friend discuss the art he loves the most ; the downloading of information leaves you a little exhausted but mostly elated . thomson has a gift for making his original observations sound almost obvious -- film noir , he writes , " is the one genre that admits we 'll lose , " and casablanca is " fake , foolish and fanciful beyond belief " but is still " the best fun . "  and while he 's unafraid to dive into the canons of some of cinema 's most celebrated but challenging directors -- michelangelo antonioni and ingmar bergman are both discussed -- he takes a refreshingly democratic view . the passion of joan of arc and alvin and the chipmunks : the ten commandments and deep throat . he thoughtfully , if grudgingly , considers the impact of hardcore pornography on viewers ( " it resembles a weekend in las vegas , and breeds as many dismayed losers " ) and takes on the mediocre-at-best career of filmmaker george lucas ( " a great entrepreneur , and a marker of industry ... with a contented lack of personality " ) .  but all of the history , all of the opinion , is in service of answering those previously stated questions . and these : what does film do to us ? does it isolate us or contribute to a common cultural language ? there are no sure-thing conclusions in art , but thomson 's guess is as good as any : we watch movies to see ourselves from unrealistic angles , because we crave the feeling of desire , and we love the artifice , the uncertainty . " it 's an impossible venture , " thomson writes , " but it is a legacy of american film -- the gift of unreality . " or , in the words of to live . " movies , for many of us , are life , and for about 90 minutes , in the comforting darkness of a theater , we can pretend that nothing will ever end .
