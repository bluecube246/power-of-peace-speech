the insects created fewer eggs when they consumed blood with 200 proof ethanol in it compared to those that sipped alcohol-free blood .  the common bed bug mainly survives on human blood , but what happens when that human has upped his or her blood alcohol content with a few glasses of a nice red wine ? new research from the university of nebraska-lincoln suggests bed bugs are not as fond of alcohol as their boozy hosts , which may lead to fewer bug bites .  according to the study , bed bugs prefer alcohol-free blood to blood with alcohol in it ; the higher the blood alcohol concentration ( bac ) , the less the bugs eat . and , because there is a direct link between blood intake and reproduction rates , those bugs also lay fewer eggs .  " bed bugs need a blood meal to grow and to molt and to reproduce , " explained ralph narain , a ph.d . candidate who conducted the work as part of his dissertation . " and one of their main hosts are alcohol was one of the easier ones to start with . "  narain presented the findings last week at the national conference on urban entomology in atlanta .  how bed bugs imbibe  while it 's fun to imagine graduate students knocking back beers and feeding bed bugs on their arms , narain took a more scientific approach in his experiment . he mixed 200 proof ethanol -- the same compound estimated by a breathalyzer -- into four samples of expired blood from the nebraska blood bank until he had bacs of 0.010 , 0.025 , 0.050 and 0.100 ( 0.08 is the legal limit for driving ) . a control sample contained no alcohol .  next , he selected 20 adult bed bugs for each blood sample , weighed them , fed them their respective samples , and weighed them again . he repeated the experiment six times .  the average mass of the bed bugs that fed on the clean blood increased by over 100 percent . those that fed on the blood with the lowest bac , 0.010 , increased just 60 percent , the bed bugs that fed on the 0.100 bac sample went up a mere 12.5 percent .  as for the eggs , the control groups laid an average of 44 after the feeding , while those that fed on the highest bac laid an average of just 12 .  it 's unclear whether the alcohol affected the adult bugs ' behavior or their offspring 's development , although future tests might attempt to measure both . narain also plans to run tests on other drugs , although he would n't officially disclose which .  way toward pest control ?  so , can we just knock back a few glasses of wine every night to keep the bed bugs away ? probably not . " i 'm not going to suggest someone should consume alcohol to control bed bugs , " narain said .  ill health affects aside , it likely would n't help curb an infestation . while the bed bugs do feed less on alcohol-laced blood , they still feed , and while they lay fewer eggs , up to 95 percent still hatch . .  dini miller , an entomologist and bed bug expert from virginia tech , agreed : " i do n't know what sort of implications it has ultimately , because unfortunately they still produce enough eggs to cause an infestation . so while they feed less , still , we 're not going to experience less of a problem . but it 's very interesting to know .
