New iPad May Sport 1GB Of RAM , But Apple Will Never Say So  0  If you were hoping that the blitz of iPad news would end with the device 's long-awaited announcement yesterday , well , sorry . Even with Cupertino 's latest tablet waiting in the wings for a March 16 release , we 're all still speculating when it comes to some of the device 's particulars , and now the new iPad 's allotment of RAM is getting its share of the spotlight .  According to The Verge , the new iPad will indeed feature double the RAM of its immediate predecessor , with a full gigabyte of memory ensconced within its aluminum frame . But why does n't Apple ever talk about it ?  That Apple would make the jump to 1GB for their newest post-PC poster child should n't come as a surprise . The original model launched with 256MB of RAM onboard , which made for some iffy use experiences after a few software updates . The iPad 2 debuted with 512MB under the hood , only a matter of time between new features and apps have iPad 2 users feeling the same sort of squeeze .  Now I ca n't speak for everyone , but my childhood in computing was spent scrounging together allowances for new RAM so my off-brand PC would n't chug quite so hard . As The Verge rightly points out , Apple 's iPad line to date has never blown the tech community away with the amount of RAM they 've included . Apple 's silence on that front is to be expected -- while they 're always eager to talk up their processors and their cameras , Apple has historically been content to leave the some of the technical specifics shrouded in mystery .  And why should n't they ? By throwing around adjectives like " magical , " " incredible , " and " amazing " at every possible opportunity , consumers are left to focus more on what they can do with an iPad rather than the little bits of silicon that make those experience happen . Sex sells , and RAM is anything but sexy . RAM matters , even if Apple would prefer you did n't know about it . As apps get more complex and more impressive ( as they should , considering how picky we are about them ) , the demands they exact on a device 's hardware grow ever greater . More robust system resources means more opportunities for developers to flex their respective muscles , and the last thing Apple needs to do is displease the people who generate revenue for them . More RAM is a win for nearly everyone involved , and while some of us may never see as much as we like in our iDevices , that should n't stop Apple from at least talking about it .
