if you 're reading this now , there 's great chance that you spend far too many of your waking hours looking at pictures of cars online . which means you 've probably noticed that many of those images have their license tags obscured in some way . being the inquisitive ( likely ) mammal that you are , you 've probably wondered why the license plate is obscured , and if it 's actually a good idea .  at least , i fit that description . here at jalopnik , we have n't had a policy to obscure license plate images -- i left them intact in , say , my classicreviews -- but it 's worth investigating this further .  some cars are so beautiful that it hits you like a canned ham fired from a cannon . the original ... read more read more  the general thinking behind pixellating or blurring or covering the license plates is based on the idea that with your license plate number , more information can be revealed about the car 's owner , without his is that the tags are already on open , public view . why should it matter if they 're in a picture , when they 're normally not hidden , anyway ?  a note to craigslist photographers : if you 're using an entire person in lieu of scotch tape to ... read more read more  in the interest of full disclosure , i 'll reveal my thoughts coming into this . i was firmly in the **36;0;toolong camp . to such a degree that i have a pair of vans with my beetle 's license plate number embroidered on the back . also , it helps that i 'm so irritating that i 'm almost kidnap-proof , even if someone could find out where i lived from my car 's tags . but , i do have a wife and son far less annoying than myself , so i better get to the bottom of this .  a simple google search reveals plenty of sites that offer ways to find out information based on license plate numbers . hell , even our gawk-bro site lifehacker did an trying to track down a bad driver or someone who keeps leaving their car ... read more read more  but that 's the internet -- i wanted the advice of someone who 's job it is to actually know what 's what with this stuff , and , ideally , have a uniform . so i called officer mosqueda of the california highway patrol and asked him , flat out , what information can people get from a license plate , and , as a chp officer , would you suggest obscuring the plate ?  the truth is you can find out a lot from someone 's license tags . officer mosqueda said that there are both legal and illegal ways to find a person 's name , address , the registration and fee history of the car , and more . all this information can be made available to anyone , either through the dmv or through paid services , many of which are online .  for example , in california , to go through the dmv , one would fill out an inf 70 form , plate number . the form does list a set of permissible uses , such as driver safety , theft , hiring commercial drivers , etc. but if someone 's the sort of perv that wants a person 's license information so they can masturbate outside their bedroom window , i do n't think they 'd have much issue lying on the form .  this method is still an improvement over how it used to be . prior to 1994 , it was easier to get home addresses from dmv records , and this was the method by which the man who murdered rebecca schaeffer , an actress from the 90s television show my sister sam , got her home address and related information . this murder led to the creation of the drivers ' privacy protection act of 1994 .  private , paid services do n't even care if you 're a creepy murderer or not -- they just take your money and send you the information . now , this information is n't your blood type and a list of your deepest , most secretest fears , but  as for the argument that your plate is already visible to anyone walking by your car , that 's certainly true . it 's just that the internet can so vastly expand the number of people able to see your license plate that it may become an issue . still , as officer mosqueda told me with a certain degree of poetry , " you ca n't blur out real life . " sage words , officer .  officer mosqueda 's final advice ? you may as well obscure your license plate , just to be safe . his attitude was that while it 's not likely the information would be found and misused , it could happen .  so , i 'm proposing a couple of little rules that i plan to live by , and will suggest that these be made jalopnik policy :  * if you take a picture of a car that is not yours , and you have not made any arrangements with the owner , then it is the photographer 's responsibility to obscure the plates .  * if you are placing your car in a situation or location where it can be reasonably expected that it will be photographed ( at a car show , on the set of a film shoot , etc. ) then it is the owner 's responsibility to obscure the license plates if desired , by physical means or electronic in the case of an owner-created photo .  oh , and if the license plate in question is a really funny or ironic personalized plate , or an inadvertently dirty one , i reserve the right to ignore all these good rules . because a penis joke on a license plate or something trumps all laws .
