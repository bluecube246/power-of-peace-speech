i 'm a budget traveler who has spent more time in dives with droopy mattresses than luxury hotels with spa treatments that cost more than suriname 's annual gdp . so on the rare occasions when i get to stay someplace truly swanky -- usually when the priceline roulette wheel shines favorably on me or if i 'm accompanying my wife on a business trip -- i sometimes feel a bit like jed clampett arriving with hillbilly family in tow in beverly hills .  did i shave that day ? is my car the cheapest one on the premises ? how much do i need to give the bellboy who is charging over to open my car door ? i had this same fish-out-of-water feeling when we pulled up to the andaz , a luxury hotel in west hollywood that is part of the hyatt chain last week . but the place turned out to be very different than any other fancy hotel i 've ever stayed in .  for starters , the young man who opened our car door and took care of our suitcases on a trolley , he escorted us into the sleek , dimly lit lobby , checked us in himself and then brought us up to the room as though we were at a small b &amp; b.  " now everything in the minibar except the alcohol is free , " he said to my surprise and puzzlement . " so all the soft drinks , bottles of water and snacks are free . "  i asked him to repeat that because i 've never heard of a free minibar before and i did n't want to get a bill for a $9 bag of chips , but i 'd heard him right . the andaz also has free wireless internet and serves good , free california wines from 5-7 p.m. each night . before i gush about this place a bit more , i should point out that unlike many " reviews " of luxury hotels , this is not a paid endorsement or quid-pro-quo deal . at gadling , we do not write about free press trips or accept other free travel perks , so you can room was stylishly decorated and had a curtained off little section in the back with a love seat , comfy chair and ottoman . my kids immediately claimed this area as their clubhouse , but it was also useful for my wife and i after the kids went to bed .  the hotel was renovated and turned into an andaz property , one of just nine around the world , in 2009 . gene autry once owned the hotel and in the ' 60s , ' 70s and ' 80s , it was known as the riot house because rock stars used to routinely trash their rooms . john bonham reportedly once rode his motorcycle down the hotel corridors , keith richards once dropped a television set from his room out onto sunset boulevard , and jim morrison lived there until he was evicted for hanging out a window by his fingertips .  those days are long gone , but recording artists still patronize the place . a big contingent of brits including the singer laura mvula was there during our stay . and they still play great music ever had the pleasure of listening to the smiths at any other hotel i 've ever stayed at besides this one .  the andaz has everything you might expect in a luxury hotel : incredibly comfortable beds , high-quality toiletries and linens , plus a very nice rooftop pool that offers lovely views of the area . we found the sunset boulevard location to be convenient but thanks to the notorious l.a. traffic , it can take a lot longer to get around than you might think .  and now for a few niggling complaints . no hotel is perfect and that includes the andaz . i found the free wireless to be extremely slow at times and when i called down to inquire i was transferred to an off-site tech support person who suggested i pay a premium to get better speed . no thanks . the valet parking is $32 per night ( there is no self-park option ) , which is n't exactly a bargain and the sumptuous buffet breakfast is strictly expense account territory at $26 a head .  but you do n't come , you 're there for a treat and the andaz certainly is one . aside from the free snacks , soft drinks and wine , my other favorite perk was the selection of free newspapers . i 'm an old-school hard copy newspaper reader and the fact that the andaz was willing to deliver copies of the new york times , the l.a. times and the wall street journal right to my doorstop made me very happy indeed . on my last night at the andaz , our neighbors stumbled back to their room at 2 a.m. and commenced a noisy party worthy of the hotel 's glory riot house days . at the time , i was annoyed but in retrospect , it was a fitting end to a memorable stay .
