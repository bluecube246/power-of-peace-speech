This week Kicking &amp; Dreaming : A Story of Heart , Soul and Rock &amp; Roll ( HarperCollins ) hits shelves . With co-author Charles Cross ( Heavier Than Heaven : A Biography of Kurt Cobain ) , the Wilson sisters dish on Heart 's formative years , the inspirations behind their hits and their personal travails , along with some sordid rock gossip . Here are some of the more notable -- and curious -- stories revealed : <p> During Ann 's junior year in high school , their parents became aware that their daughters were regularly smoking pot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night after dinner , the Wilson parents suggested that the whole family toke together . Ann recalls it being rather embarrassing : " It was n't the best pot , but I was n't about to share my connection with my parents . " <p> " Crazy On You " was inspired by Ann 's first serious romance , with Michael Fischer , who would soon become Heart 's iron-fisted manager . The pair shacked up on a hippie commune in Canada . Wilson writes that while the lyrics " were straight out of the scenes of wild sexuality that went on in the cottage , " they were also about her feminist awakening and finding empowerment through her music . <p> During Heart 's earliest incarnation they were primarily a cover band , cementing their reputation in the Vancouver club scene with their set of Led Zeppelin songs . In March 1975 , Heart was onstage performing " Stairway to Heaven " when Zeppelin themselves walked in , fresh from their show at the Pacific Coliseum . Wilson writes that the foursome seemed oblivious , disappearing into the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his doctor " before promptly passing out . <p> When Nancy was on location with her then-husband ( and former Rolling Stone scribe ) Cameron Crowe while he was directing the 2001 bomb Vanilla Sky , the film 's star , Tom Cruise , gave the couple a personally guided tour of Scientology 's Celebrity Centre . <p> The early radio success of " Magic Man " was paid for with hookers and cocaine . The band 's publicist would ferry the Wilson sisters to radio appearances where they would meet the DJ , do a station ID and then be told to go wait outside . According to Nancy , " When we were out of the way , he 'd pass the DJ a gram of cocaine or the number of a hooker he 'd lined up and say ' She 's yours , on Heart . ' It was n't until years later that the Wilson sisters found out about the shady dealings that had gone on behind their backs . <p> The photo negative for a topless picture of Ann Wilson , taken surreptitiously by Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a shoot with the photographer for the band 's Bebe Le Strange-era Rolling Stone cover went south , the band demanded the famed rock photographer destroy her copy ; when she refused , Heart took her to court . The judge ordered the negative to be kept in a safe deposit box that could only be opened with two keys -- one belonging to Wilson and the other to Leibovitz -- insuring it would never see the light of day . <p> In the fall of 1982 , Heart had a brush with the legendary ego of John Cougar Mellencamp . The young singer was opening the band 's tour behind Private Audition , Heart 's first album that was n't an immediate million-seller , when Mellencamp 's " Jack and Diane " went to number one . He came to the band with a proposition : " Seeing as your album is a turkey and mine is a hit , care to swap places ? " The Wilson sisters declined , reminding him that the tour had sold out before he 'd even been announced as the opening act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alex and Eddie , in their own fumbling , wasted way , suggested a four-way-of-sorts between them . The sisters declined , but later that night , when Nancy learned that Eddie did n't own an acoustic guitar she was incredulous , and she gave him one of her own before sending him on his way . The next morning , after a night-long binge , he called her hotel room and serenaded her over the phone .
