related topics  a subsidiary of furniture retailer ikea is logging old-growth forests and other high conservation value forests in western russia , according to the global forestry coalition .  gfc -- an alliance of ngos from more than 40 countries -- alleges that ikea 's wholly owned logging subsidiary swedwood has been clear-cutting forests in high biodiversity value areas and logging very old trees in parts of the russian karelia region .  the furniture giant uses the " we love wood " slogan to highlight its claim to use only wood sourced in an environmentally and socially responsible way .  swedwood is certified by the forest stewardship council . gfc has also criticized nepcon , the company that ensures that the company 's facilities are fsc-compliant . gfc has called nepcon allowing the logging of old-growth trees under the fsc banner " a scandal . "  ikea says that the average age of the trees that its harvests in karelia is 160 years . the company also says that what 's vital when looking at total forest management is not the age earlier logging , but proper management that plans the logging in accordance with good conservation procedures and biodiversity .  in a response to gfc 's claims , ikea said that some 17 percent of of swedwood 's total leasehold in karelia is exempt from cutting , either by legislative demand or voluntarily . ikea says this is a far greater proportion of land than legally required . furthermore , when the leasehold 's limits were determined in 2004 , ikea says it gave up areas of about nine percent of the total leasehold , following dialogue with greenpeace , as the natural values of these areas were considered too high to conduct responsible forestry .  the company says the new pallets can support the same load as traditional timber pallets , but are just one-third the height , at two inches high . this means ikea can fit more goods into each shipment . the cardboard pallets are also only 5.5 pounds , 90 percent lighter than their predecessor .  earlier this week , greenpeace accused kfc is using wood from rainforests to make its packaging . the pulp &amp; paper to make such things as chicken buckets , french fry cartons and drinks containers , the environmental organization said .  reader comments  important issue does not seem to be well summarized toward a solution/action and i do not understand why kfc was brought in . we have much work to do to build a sustainable world ; let 's be as organized and effective in our efforts as we can be . thanks  as the fsc certification service provider to swedwood karelia , we would like to explain more about nepcon 's role and the fsc certification process . we welcome comments from stakeholders and we take them very seriously . that is why we conducted a follow-up field audit last year , based on formal complaints over swedwood karelia 's forest management regime including logging in old-growth forest . we are always willing to address and correct any possible error in our auditing work . however , our follow-up audit did not reveal any non-conformances with the applicable fsc forest management standards ; as professional fsc auditors , we do not and may not  it is also important to understand that the russian fsc forest management certification standard has been developed by key russian stakeholders , following fsc 's procedures that require balanced influence by environmental , social , and economic interests .
