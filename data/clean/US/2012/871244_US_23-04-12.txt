<p> The e-mail arrived in James Charles Cafferty 's inbox on July 14 , 2011 . Unlike most unsolicited e-mail on the Internet , the message did not pitch mortgages , get rich quick scams , or penis pills . Instead , it provided a link to an under-the-radar child pornography website and the password needed to access it . Cafferty , a diplomatic security officer working for the US government at its London embassy , waited for three days , then clicked on the link . This is what he saw : <p> " Welcome to the hidden side of yur soul , where you view the yung and innocent . We have been around since 2002 , offering the best of private and series Child Pornography ( CP ) , ( hardcore/soft core ) all for FREE ! All you have to do , enter in the password , and you 'll be viewing free CP for days . We move around when we have to ... congratulations for finding us . Yur old password wo n't work , so get the new one and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its target well ; Cafferty did have a hidden side of his soul . An online dating profile he created at the site Plenty of Fish said that he was looking for " a relationship with someone who can enjoy the ' simple ' things of life such as walking in the park , enjoying a nice sunset , engaging in good conversation or go people watching at a caf ? . " But he also craved child pornography . Cafferty owned a Drobo backup device that he stuffed with twin Western Digital hard drives in a RAID configuration to guard against data loss . On the drives , he kept his tens of thousands of child porn files . <p> Sometimes he did more than look at them , too . Cafferty would also fire up image editing software on his computer and splice his image into some scenes . <p> Below the website 's promotional copy sat a " law enforcement note " ; the kind that used to feature on warez sites as a talisman that might keep the cops at bay . " If you happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing this website , it 's called free speech , " it said . " There is nothing illegal about this website . Our servers are located in a country that has no Child Pornography laws . Even if you are able to shut us down , we pop up again somewhere else ... " <p> Cafferty stared at the screen , then typed in the password found in the e-mail . He was in . Another page popped up listing 35 free videos with names like " Full version of known video . 3 10-12 y.o . girls and man " and an explicit description of the action . Beside each video was a " download " button that provided one-minute previews of each video . Forty-nine seconds after entering his password , Cafferty clicked on video number four , a 71-minute file that claimed to feature a " 9-10 y.o . girl and man . " A third webpage opened to display the video , which appeared to buffer -- but the connection soon slowed and then stopped altogether . Eventually , Cafferty abandoned the site . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a data center , his online visit had tripped a silent alarm . That click on the " download " button had logged his IP address , the video file he attempted to view , and the number of times he tried to watch site videos . The law enforcement warning on the site 's front page had done nothing to keep the FBI away ; indeed , the FBI ran the site . <p> And now they had Cafferty . <p> Totally a legitimate website <h> Spear-phishing , FBI style <p> The e-mail had not arrived in Cafferty 's inbox by accident . Back in 2006 , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) had opened a major investigation into a string of child porn websites . As part of that work , ICE learned that the sites used PayPal to receive money and disguised the nature of the purchases by using odd subject identifiers . A website called Sick Child Room 2005 , for instance , used as its PayPal subject identifier the phrase " SickCR Package v.5.06 Build 3638 " -- which makes it sound like a software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names like " Door 1 , " " Door 5 , " and " Medic 's Corner . " Behind the doors waited 150 videos and 20,000 child porn images . <p> Cafferty 's mug shot <p> Pinellas County , Florida <p> ICE went to Paypal and obtained a list of 5,000 people who had subscribed to these sites . The priority was of course getting at those who ran the sites , but the subscribers were n't off the hook . One of the e-mail addresses that had purchased access to the Sick Child Room was Travelerva88@yahoo.com . Investigators served an administrative subpoena to Yahoo , which turned over subscriber information for the account . It belonged to someone who also used the address caffertyj@gmail.com and who worked in London -- but who listed a Largo , Florida home address . The information from Yahoo also contained , surprisingly enough , a link to the user 's Facebook profile . <p> Putting Cafferty 's name to the account was n't particularly difficult after this . Investigators eventually realized that their target was a US government employee working as a Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point it was July 2011 , and the child porn purchases had happened 5+ years before . Investigators decided that , before pursuing Cafferty , they wanted to know if he was still involved in the CP scene . <p> The case went to Corey Monaghan , a detective in the Largo , Florida police department and a member of the FBI 's nationwide Innocent Images Task Force . On July 14 , 2011 , Monaghan contacted his colleagues at the FBI 's Innocent Images Operations Unit in Maryland and asked them to deploy an " investigative tool " to determine Cafferty 's continued interest in child porn . In initial court documents , all descriptions of the tool were redacted -- but the Smoking Gun got its hands on the unredacted original and published several key pages . <p> The FBI had set up its fake CP site for precisely this situation . When investigators had a lead on someone specific , they e-mailed the person with a custom password and the site URL . The strangely explicit front page discussion about the " Child Pornography " within made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accessing . As Monaghan 's unredacted affidavit makes clear , " nowhere on the website home page indicates sic any adult pornography or anything other than child pornography is available through this website . " In reality , the site offered no child porn ; the video loading screen had been purpose-built to fail in such a way that visitors believed their Internet connections to be the culprits . <p> Soon after Cafferty 's visit to the site , the Innocent Images task force knew they had found their man . Not only had he used his custom password -- he had logged in with a London IP address . Time to pay him a visit .
