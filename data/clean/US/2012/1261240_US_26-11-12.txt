<h> You are here <h> Literary Paris still lives in the hangouts of history 's best writers <p> You do n't have to be emotionally tortured or morally conflicted to follow in the footsteps of the greats in Paris <p> By Chris Gould , for CNN Travel 26 November , 2012 <p> You can eat like a lord -- or at least like a pretty good writer -- at these literature-steeped Paris bars and caf ? s <p> More than just a city for lovers , Paris is also a source of inspiration to which the great writers have long gravitated . <p> Sartre , Hemingway , Miller , Maurras , Hugo and more penned some of their greatest works in the bustling caf ? s and bars of the French capital . <p> Here are five of the very best . <h> Les Deux Magots <p> Another of Hemingway 's favorites . Did the man ever stay home ? <p> Starting out as a novelty goods store majestically overlooked by Saint Sulpice Church on Saint Germain des Pr ? s , Les Deux Magots has -- post-1885 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining spots . <p> The iconic caf ? with its turquoise awning draws its name from the two Chinese figurines on the wall , intriguing mementoes from the establishment 's previous incarnation . <p> Over the years , they have been witnessed over the coffee-cup rims of Jean Paul Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir and Ernest Hemingway . <p> To cement its place in literary folklore , the establishment has even offered its own literary prize each January since 1933 . <p> A favorite of Breton and Picasso and thus key to the surrealist art movement , Les Deux Magots has also helped enhance France 's high-class dining image on the movie screen . <p> Its interior , crammed with Parisian charm in the shape of leather seats and shining brass rails , has graced a number of motion pictures , most memorably the 1973 comedy classic " The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob . " <p> Thankfully , unlike in that movie , the caf ? -- while packed with tourists from all nations -- is not a breeding ground for counter-revolutionaries seeking to kidnap political rivals . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything , culinary or historical , and they will answer ) serving melt-in-the-mouth omelets , the freshest orange juice , and a mouthwatering array of cakes and tartes paraded daily on a giant platter . <h> Caf ? de Flore <p> A stone 's throw away from Les Deux Magots is Caf ? de Flore , another Paris landmark , easily recognized by its signature green title on a white awning . <p> Founded " without doubt " in 1887 , according to its website , the caf ? drew its name from the statue of a petite goddess across the street . <p> The years just prior to 1900 saw author Charles Maurras put the finishing touches to " Sous le Signe de Flore " within , while the prewar years would see Apollinaire and Salmon use the ground floor to edit the arts review " Les Soir ? es de Paris . " <p> With the help of Andr ? Breton , who presumably spent entire days hopping between Flore and Deux Magots , these Pernod-fuelled collaborators would eventually spawn the Dadaist movement . <h> L'Auberge Etchegorry <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L'Auberge Etchegorry . <p> Next , we move from the car-horn commotions of Saint Germain des Pr ? s to the quieter surroundings of Corvisart , seemingly roped in birdsong , a short distance from the head offices of Le Monde newspaper . <p> Here you will find L'Auberge Etchegorry , a homely eatery formerly known by the more risqu ? title of " Cabaret de Madame Gr ? goire . " <p> The quintessentially elegant Parisian businesswoman , Madame Gr ? goire was easily able to charm Victor Hugo and Beranger in the 1850s -- with the quality of her shows alone , we are informed . <p> A fresco inside the present-day restaurant depicts a seated Hugo enjoying the show with his friends while a dubiously modestly dressed Madame Gr ? goire looks on . <p> Located opposite a richly green park which is tranquility personified , the present-day Etchegorry prides itself on a host of predominantly Basque dishes . <p> Among these can be found the sumptuous paupiettes de canard with foie gras and the irrepressible noix de Saint-Jacques , best described with the words " Broiled Scallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu claims . <p> A small hotel adjoins the restaurant , the perfect stopover for couples determined to optimize the Etchegorry experience . <h> La Coupole <p> Proclaiming itself as " the most famous Parisian brasserie in the world , " La Coupole flaunts its intriguing Art Deco interior to customers with only the merest hint of modesty . <p> Packed with original paintings from the Roaring Twenties peeping out from between imitation marble pillars , the brasserie devotes several pages of its website to listing the sheer number of celebrities striding , hobbling and stumbling through its doors . <p> The latter would often end up in the establishment having first enriched the coffers of La Rotonde , the nearby cinema-caf ? complex to which he claimed every taxi driver in the city would automatically take him . <p> Today 's menu is rich in seafood , with Dover sole , phyllo-wrapped prawns and oysters from Ireland and Normandy usually available . <p> All-encompassing seafood platters are on order for anywhere between ? 26 ( US$33 ) and ? 115.
