( Office of Public Affairs , Administration for Children and Families via The New York Times ) -- EDITORIAL USE ONLY <p> An undated handout photo of a Lackland Air Force Base dormitory being used for children who crossed the border alone . In April , 2012 , federal officials began housing 200 illegal immigrant children at the base , <p> The unprecedented surge of children caught trudging through South Texas scrublands or crossing at border ports of entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand their shelter , legal representation and reunification services . On any given day this year , the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has been caring for more than 2,100 unaccompanied child immigrants . <p> The influx came to light last week when 100 kids were taken to Lackland AFB for temporary housing . It was the first time the government has turned to the Defense Department -- now , 200 boys and girls younger than 18 stay in a base dormitory . <p> While the issue of unaccompanied minors arriving in the U.S. is n't new , the scale of the recent increase is . From October 2011 through March , 5,252 kids landed in U.S. custody without a parent or guardian -- a 93 percent increase from the same period the previous year , according to data released by the Department of Health and Human Services . In March alone , 1,390 kids arrived . <p> The cause of the surge remains a mystery to child migrant advocates and government officials . The kids are coming from the same places as usual -- Guatemala , El Salvador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explanations : they made the trek to look for parents already in the U.S. ; they 're seeking economic opportunity to send money home ; they want to escape violence or abuse . <p> " We 're talking to the children , but we do n't have one solid answer , " said Lauren Fisher of the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project , which helps children and their families navigate the system . " There seem to be the same reasons that we 've seen before . " <p> Some have suggested that human smugglers are more aggressively marketing their services . Others wonder if the Border Patrol , whose presence has doubled in recent years , is simply catching more of them . But Border Patrol apprehensions of children and adults were cut in half from 2008 to 2011 , and only 5 percent of those caught are unaccompanied children . Younger children commonly cross with adult smugglers at the ports of entry , while older kids join groups that follow guides through the brush . <p> A South Texas woman told border authorities this month that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hidalgo , Texas , and Reynosa , Mexico , was her sister , according to court records . She even presented a Texas birth certificate . But the girl could n't answer basic questions , so the woman told customs officers that she was n't related to the girl at all . She said that a man whom she worked with in Mexico offered her $2,000 to " cross " the girl -- who was actually from Guatemala -- and accompany her to Houston . The woman was charged with transporting an illegal immigrant . <p> Last week , the first ladies of Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala spoke at a three-day conference on unaccompanied minors in Washington , D.C. Mexico 's first lady , Margarita Zavala , and Honduras ' Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo noted that tougher U.S. border security made it more difficult for parents working in the U.S. to return for their children , a suggestion as to why parents increasingly would put their children in a smuggler 's care . <p> " The statistics are worrisome , " said Rosa Maria Leal de Perez , Guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children repatriated in the last year . " <p> Child welfare groups are in " triage mode , " said Wendy Young , executive director of Kids in Need of Defense , a Washington , D.C.-based nonprofit that matches pro bono attorneys with unaccompanied minors navigating the immigration system . " It 's important that the resources and the capacity meet the need , and we 're not quite there yet . " <p> The Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities in 10 states range from shelters to foster homes and have about 2,500 beds . Government-contracted shelters were maxing out their emergency bed space , setting up cots in gymnasiums and other extra spaces . <p> " It 's a much more limited set of services , " Fisher said . " It felt something like a Red Cross shelter , a hurricane shelter . " <p> Unaccompanied children are first processed by the Department of Homeland Security , then turned over to the ORR while the deportation process begins . Once in a shelter , the search begins for relatives or an acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pro bono attorneys . When a custodian is found , the child can leave the shelter and await immigration proceedings . <p> Eighty percent of the children referred to the ORR end up in a shelter , according to a report released last month by the Vera Institute of Justice -- a nonprofit that developed a program to better provide access to legal services for children . The average shelter stay is 61 days . <p> At the Lackland shelter , HHS spokesman Jesse Garcia said the goal is to move kids to more establishe accommodations within 15 days . <p> " We are looking to add some educational features that are appropriate for a 30-day temporary program , " Garcia said . <p> As of late Friday , 83 children had already been transferred out of Lackland , most to permanent facilities . Nineteen had been reunited with family .
