<p> A new job or venture is as terrifying as it is exhilarating , especially if you 're a manager . What are the best ways to navigate a big transition ? We asked five leaders to reveal what they learned during a recent power move . Then , we tapped the leadership experts at DDI* to assess how our fearless leaders have handled their staff ( and themselves ) amid the chaos . <p> Global Head of Sales , Western Union Business Solutions Agiasotis shot up the corporate chain when Western Union acquired his previous employer , Travelex Global Business Payments . He is now responsible for a staff of 600 , as well as his family 's relocation from Sydney to London . <p> Self-Assessment : " The big change for me has been coming into a public company from a private one . It 's an entirely different set of pressures . A publicly listed company has a board that defines the way that it thinks about the world and identifies the pressures that it is under . I 've never had to look through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a new way of communicating . <p> I have had my fair share of unexpected situations that have been distracting . I 'm dealing with the nitty-gritty of moving and settling into a new country . I 'm getting up to speed with the current status of business in other geographies that I had n't had much to do with historically . At this stage , I feel like a juggler who is trying to set a new record for how many things he can keep up in the air , and I 'm throwing them a little higher than normal . " <p> DDI Assessment : Kerry needs to identify high-level people who have a stake in the outcome of his work . He should cultivate them as partners and demonstrate openness to their ideas . And he should resist the temptation to be the sole author of any plans . Kerry 's strength in the past has been the ability to develop strategies alone . His job now is to build a reputation as the person who brings key people together to make better decisions . <p> AGIASOTIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved in all aspects , from what needs to be done to how it should be done . The challenge for me now is to create an environment where people are empowered and motivated enough to execute on their own . Of all the adjustments I have to make , this has been the hardest . "
