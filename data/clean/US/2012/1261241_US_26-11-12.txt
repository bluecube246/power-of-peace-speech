<p> The number of Americans with diabetes skyrocketed over the last 15 years , as diabetes cases rose by 50 percent or more in 42 different states -- and by 100 percent or more in 18 states -- during that time period , according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Now , another CDC report highlights the rapidly increasing number of U.S. children who have diabetes , warning that the country needs to prepare for their future care . <p> If the current increase in diabetes cases stays constant , the number of children with type 2 diabetes will likely increase by 49 percent by 2050 . The number of cases of type 1 diabetes , which is less common and diagnosed earlier in life , could increase by 23 percent : <p> " These numbers are very important , " said study lead author Dr. Giuseppina Imperatore , of the CDC 's division of diabetes translation . " As a society , we will need to plan and prepare for the high-quality care of these children . " ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidence of type 1 diabetes will rise from about 166,000 American children with the disease today to more than 203,000 in 2050 . The number of children with type 2 diabetes will jump from about 20,000 today to 30,000 in 2050 , according to the study . <p> If the rates of diabetes increase just slightly , however , the picture quickly becomes far more grim . The number of children with type 1 diabetes will almost triple to about 587,000 , and the rate of type 2 diabetes will quadruple , with about 84,000 U.S. children affected , according to the study . <p> Imperatore said these estimates should be considered boundaries for where diabetes might go . She said it 's possible that the rates could decline , particularly if researchers make inroads into preventing type 1 diabetes . <p> Researchers do not know how to stop type 1 diabetes , Imperatore said , but it is clear that obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and exercise and losing weight can help prevent it . There 's more to understand about both types of diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association 's chief scientific and medical officer , especially about the genetic risks . " The obesity epidemic is n't due to sloth and gluttony . It 's an interaction between biology and the environment , " he said .
