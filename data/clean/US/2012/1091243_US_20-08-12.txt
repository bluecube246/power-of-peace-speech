Tang <p> Botany is plagued by the same problem as the rest of science and society : our ability to generate data quickly and cheaply is surpassing our ability to access and analyze it . In this age of big data , scientists facing too much information rely on computers to search large data sets for patterns that are beyond the capability of humans to recognize--but computers can only interpret data based on the strict set of rules in their programming . <p> New tools called ontologies provide the rules computers need to transform information into knowledge , by attaching meaning to data , thereby making those data retrievable by computers and more understandable to human beings . Ontology , from the Greek word for the study of being or existence , traditionally falls within the purview of philosophy , but the term is now used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge in a consistent fashion . An ontology in this contemporary sense is a description of the types of entities within a given domain and the relationships among them . <p> A new article in this month 's American Journal of Botany by Ramona Walls ( New York Botanical Garden ) and colleagues describes how scientists build ontologies such as the Plant Ontology ( PO ) and how these tools can transform plant science by facilitating new ways of gathering and exploring data . <p> When data from many divergent sources , such as data about some specific plant organ , are associated or " tagged " with particular terms from a single ontology or set of interrelated ontologies , the data become easier to find , and computers can use the logical relationships in the ontologies to correctly combine the information from the different databases . Moreover , computers can also use ontologies to aggregate data associated with the different subclasses or parts of entities . <p> For example , suppose a researcher is searching online for all examples of gene expression in a leaf . Any botanist performing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and midribs or in a frond . However , a search engine would not know that it needs to include these terms in its search--unless it was told that a frond is a type of leaf , and that every petiole and every midrib are parts of some leaf . It is this information that ontologies provide . <p> The article in the American Journal of Botany by Walls and colleagues describes what ontologies are , why they are relevant to plant science , and some of the basic principles of ontology development . It includes an overview of the ontologies that are relevant to botany , with a more detailed description of the PO and the challenges of building an ontology that covers all green plants . The article also describes four keys areas of plant science that could benefit from the use of ontologies : ( 1 ) comparative genetics , genomics , phenomics , and development ; ( 2 ) taxonomy and systematics ; ( 3 ) semantic applications ; and ( 4 ) education . Although most of the examples in this article are drawn from plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisms , and the article should be of interest to zoologists as well . <p> As genomic and phenomic data become available for more species , many different research groups are embarking on the annotation of their data and images with ontology terms . At the same time , cross-species queries are becoming more common , causing more researchers in plant science to turn to ontologies . Ontology developers are working with the scientists who generate data to make sure ontologies accurately reflect current science , and with database developers and publishers to find ways to make it easier for scientist to associate their data with ontologies . <p> ### <p> Walls , Ramona L. , Balaji Athreya , Laurel Cooper , Justin Elser , Maria A.
