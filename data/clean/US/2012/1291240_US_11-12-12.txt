<h> EAA Publishes List of LODA-Approved CFIs <p> Pilots looking for training in experimental aircraft just got a little help from the Experimental Aircraft Association . EAA has created a page on its website listing instructors who are authorized to provide flight instruction in specified amateur-built aircraft through a letter of deviation authority ( LODA ) . The LODA authorized instructor list was compiled based on FAA data and is organized by state , making it easy for pilots to search for an instructor nearby . The list was one of three recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board as part of its effort to make amateur-built flying safer . <p> A LODA provides relief for instructors from FAR 92.319 , which prohibits pilots from flying for compensation or hire in experimental aircraft . LODA approved instructors can provide valuable instruction for pilots constructing their own amateur-built aircraft , increasing the chances of a safe and successful first flight . <p> But because a LODA requires an application process , which must be started at least 60 days prior to the " date of intended operations " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a limited amount of available instructors . While builders may have a hard time finding an instructor flying an airplane of the same type , they will still benefit from training with an instructor in a similar aircraft .
