eaa publishes list of loda-approved cfis  pilots looking for training in experimental aircraft just got a little help from the experimental aircraft association . eaa has created a page on its website listing instructors who are authorized to provide flight instruction in specified amateur-built aircraft through a letter of deviation authority ( loda ) . the loda authorized instructor list was compiled based on faa data and is organized by state , making it easy for pilots to search for an instructor nearby . the list was one of three recommendations from the national transportation safety board as part of its effort to make amateur-built flying safer .  a loda provides relief for instructors from far 92.319 , which prohibits pilots from flying for compensation or hire in experimental aircraft . loda approved instructors can provide valuable instruction for pilots constructing their own amateur-built aircraft , increasing the chances of a safe and successful first flight .  but because a loda requires an application process , which must be started at least 60 days prior to the " date of intended operations " and , there is a limited amount of available instructors . while builders may have a hard time finding an instructor flying an airplane of the same type , they will still benefit from training with an instructor in a similar aircraft .
