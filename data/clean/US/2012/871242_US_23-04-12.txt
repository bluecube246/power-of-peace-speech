byrichard horanapril 23 , 2012  it used to be that as americans moved up the ladder , they moved farther away from the city . not anymore . according to political scientist , alan ehrenhalt , author of the great inversion and the future of the american city , they 're flocking back in droves these days . for example , at the time of 9/11 there were 15,000 people living south of the world trade center . by 2007 there were 50,000 . " the strollers have reached wall street .... take a walk down there some saturday and you will see for yourself . " in other words , our manifest destiny is no longer toward wider open spaces and bigger homes ; it 's more like a refrain from the famous petula clark song : " downtown , things 'll be great when you 're downtown .... "  inspired by his hero , the grass-roots activist and urban planner , jane jacobs , ehrenhalt , walked around many of america 's big cities over the past 10 years -- chicago , new phoenix -- trying to understand how they were changing . what he discovered was a " radical rearrangement in which people who possessed money and choice were increasingly living in the center , while newcomers and the poor were settling in the suburbs , often in the outer reaches of suburban territory . in short , many american metropolitan areas were coming to look more like the european cities of a century ago .... " this cultural phenomenon , unobserved and underreported , convinced ehrenhalt that american society was , in fact , demographically inverting right under our noses , hence the term " demographic inversion " ( as opposed to " gentrification " ) .  with a " quick glance backwards , " ehrenhalt offers up baron georges-eugene haussmann 's redesigned paris of the 1860s ( with a few references to fin de si ? clevienna ) as the paradigmatic city , with its percolating street life acting as " a theatre for living , " and , in ehrenhalt 's mind , " what the " millions of people with substantial earning power or ample savings ... are with sheffield , a neighborhood three miles north of downtown chicago as a prime example of this great demographic inversion , ehrenhalt takes his reader on a tour of the changing american cityscape , pointing out the salient features that have given rise to the transformation of this once shabby , working class neighborhood into one of cosmopolitan chic : the proximity to downtown chicago , the mass transit station , the nearby university , the charming victorian cottages , and the commercial corridor . and that 's just sheffield . chicago 's entire loop ( five miles north and south of downtown , and a mile from lake michigan ) exploded by 48% in just seven years between 2000 and 2007 .  ehrenhalt cites a few other near-center , arrondissements that have similarly burgeoned over the past decade , namely portland , ore. ; and clarendon , va. , eight miles due west of d.c. he implies but does not come right out and say that the linchpins for their success are three-fold : 1 ) jobs 2 ) readily accessible light-rail transit , and 3 ) charm , from nowhere , " a similarly themed endeavor -- " promotes the intersection of relationships and invites one set of patterns to interact with other patterns , including the complex patterns of individual human minds . "  from there , the great inversion is not so ... great .  the bushwick section of brooklyn , for example . long synonymous with grim poverty , gangs , and drug dealers , it is today a happening bedroom community for new york 's young artists . be that as it may , there are still " long , dreary blocks lined with abandoned textile factories and large strips of vacant land . " cheap , yes , lively , sure , but still uglier than a stump full of spiders . philadelphia is another not-exactly-there-yet city that ehrenhalt examines . yes , philly has an elegant central core along walnut street with " a lunchtime pedestrian count of more than two thousand a day , " but it also has more violent crimes per capita than any of the other 10 largest cities in america , and , according to the , 36.5 for every one thousand residential units . " not exactly an american vienna .  ehrenhalt shows us the suburban side of the story in gwinnett county , georgia , a suburb outside atlanta . this was once a rural expanse of 437 acres , and today the quintessence of our " suburban immigrant nation . " there 's even a new taj mahal there , called bochasanwasi shri akshar purushoram swaminarayan sanstha temple ( baps for short ) , situated next to a walgreens in lilburn , ga . gwinnett used to have great football teams , but with the influx of asian immigrants , its highest scores are now recorded on the sats . the demographic is split right down the middle 50/50 white to non-white .  then there are , to use ehrenhalt 's own analogy , the pinocchios :  phoenix , is a central-coreless sprawlscape that is trying its hardest to make itself over into an urban center , and though they are investing heavily in miles of transit lines and new centers of urbanity , their plan at present is to build has emerged as the " capital of the suburban town center phenomenon , " has converted an unused airport ten minutes from the city 's downtown into a new urban experiment in the retrofitting of suburban america with shops and residents all in one . so much for haussmann 's 1860s paris .  " the great inversion " is an enjoyable and engaging read , especially for those considering a move back to the city . it is solidly researched with great questions asked and plenty of hard facts and anecdotal answers provided . and though ehrenhalt manages to keep his objectivity throughout most of the book , at the very end he reveals himself to be a cockeyed eur-optimist to wit , " people are settling in cities -- those who have a choice -- in large part to experience the things that citizens of paris and vienna experienced a century ago : round the clock street life ; caf ? sociability ; casual acquaintances they meet on the sidewalk every day ; merchants who recognize them . this is the direction i think we are heading in . ; however , he might want to make note of the fact that mcdonald 's and walmart announced record profits in 2010 and gm did the same in 2011 . vive les ? tats-unis !  richard horan is a novelist and the author of " seeds : one man 's serendipitous journey to find the trees that inspired famous american writers from faulkner to kerouac , welty to wharton . " his latest work , " harvest : a picaresque adventure into the heart of america 's family farms , " is due out this summer from harper collins .
