Can a Burst of UV Bust Hospital-Borne Infections?

nasty clostridium difficile can lurk on door handles and other surfaces , leading to severe intestinal distress ; acinetobacter can also survive in the open air , threatening to cause pneumonia , urinary tract infections and blood infections ; and vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( vre ) is tough to beat with other drugs and can infect wound and catheter sites , as well as the bloodstream . even a thorough traditional cleaning by staff , with disinfecting sprays , can leave spots untouched -- and dangerously contaminated .  a new study finds that a certain frequency of ultraviolet ( uv ) light can kill almost all of these nasty bugs from at least the surfaces of a hospital room -- even when not directly exposed to the light .  a team of researchers sampled five high-contact areas in hospital bedrooms and bathrooms ( such as bed rails , toilets and remote controls ) where patients with c. difficile , acinetobacter or vre infections had been staying . they then brought in a machine outfitted with eight bulbs to emit short-wave uv radiation ( uv-c ) for the same locations for any persisting bacteria or spores .  " we were able to demonstrate that we could achieve well over 90 percent reduction in each of those three bad bugs after using the uv light , " deverick anderson , co-director of the duke infection control outreach network , and study collaborator , said during a media briefing call earlier this week . even shadowed surfaces that escaped direct uv exposure demonstrated this drastic reduction in bacteria . the findings were presented october 18 at idweek , a meeting to highlight progress in the fight against infectious diseases , in san diego .  uv-c radiation has already been deployed by food processors and utilitiesto kill bugs in food and water , respectively -- and it is also used to sterilize some medical equipment . putting it to use for larger targets -- such as hospital rooms -- might become a new standard step in healthcare disinfection . the researchers did not , however , compare the light 's effectiveness with that of standard cleaning procedures . " we would never propose that the uv light be the a prepared statement . " but in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance , it could become an important addition to hospitals ' arsenal . "  previous work had shown that uv-c can also cut down on mrsa ( methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ) in hospital rooms . " we have a solid foundation to show that this approach succeeds in both experimental and real-world conditions , " anderson said in a prepared statement . " now it 's time to see if we can demonstrate that it indeed decreases the rate of infections among patients . " after all , it would be nice to be rid of our acquired infection risk in a flash .
