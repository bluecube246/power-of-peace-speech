gonorrhea becoming resistant to last available class of antibiotics  comstock images gonorrhea used to be easily treated with a single pill . now , to delay resistance to the last antibiotic available to treat it , the cdc is recommending against the oral drug and pushing an injectable antibiotic in its place .  cleveland , ohio-- there may soon come a time when there is no effective treatment available for gonorrhea , a sexually transmitted infection , or sti , that until recently had been easily cured with oral antibiotics .  resistance to the last class of antibiotics available to treat the disease has been showing up in populations around the world , and will likely soon follow in the united states .  " we believe it is only a matter of time until gonorrhea develops resistance to this last remaining treatment option , " said dr.gail bolan , director of the centers for disease control and prevention 's division of std prevention in a telebriefing recentlyannouncing new treatment guidelines for gonorrhea .  the cdc is now discouraging the use of an disease . the agency is instead advocating the use of an injectable drug in the same antibiotic class , called ceftriaxone , in combination with one oftwo other oral antibiotics ( azithromycin ordoxycycline ) .  the cdc hopes the change will help delay the development of resistance in the united states .  gonorrhea , which classically causes burning and pain during urination , is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the united states behind chlamydia , which dwarfs gonorrhea cases by a ratio of more than 4-to-1 . about 309,000 cases of gonorrheawere reported in 2010 nationally , and 2,700 of those cases were in cuyahoga county , according to the cdcand the cuyahoga county board of health .  because the infection often causes mild or vague symptoms such as vaginaldischarge in women , or no symptoms at all , epidemiologists estimate that there are probably more than twice as many cases in the population as are reported .  untreated infection in women can lead to serious side effects including pelvic inflammatory disease ( pain in the pelvis caused by infection of the uterus , chronic pelvic pain and miscarriage , said dr.ann avery , an infectious-disease specialist at metrohealth medical center .  the current treatment regimen , a single oral dose of an antibiotic , has been relatively easy to administer to patients . in some states , doctors can provide the patient with a dose of the antibiotic for the partner or write a prescription for a sexual partner who is reluctant to see a doctor but is also likely infected .  anyone who takes an oral dose of antibiotic rather thanthe injectable treatment needs to be seen by a doctor a week afterward to see if his or herinfection has cleared and to be checked for antibiotic resistance .  the bacteria that causes gonorrhea , neisseria gonorrhoeae , is notoriously good at adapting to avoid our attempts to kill it , said dr. robert bonomo , professor of medicine , pharmacology , molecular biology and microbiology at case western reserve university .  " superstrains " of gonorrhea resistant to penicillin and tetracycline cropped up in the 1970s and ' 80s and to a class of drugs called fluoroquinolones , year , a japanese research group announced the discovery of a strain of gonorrhea that ca n't be killed by cephalosporins , the last class of antibiotics available . the strain , called h041 , was limited to a few people at the time , but has since spread to several other countries .  in the united states at the same time , the cdc released a report that showed a decrease in susceptibility of gonorrhea samples taken from sites across the country to cephalosporins . resistance is measured with something called minimum inhibitory concentrations , or mics -- an elevated mic means it takes a higher dose of the drug to kill the bug .  while there were very few samples that showed a decreased susceptibility to cefixime at the time -- only 0.11 percent -- this number was up from only 0.02 percent during the last sampling period three years earlier . now , that percentage is up to 1.5 percent for cefixime , and has increased from 0 percent to 0.4 percent for the injectable antibiotic ceftriaxone .  " this is a clear warning sign , " dr.robert kirkcaldy , medical epidemiologist with the cdc 's division of std prevention , said in the telebriefing .  the most prominent mic increases were in samples taken from the western united states and from gay and bisexual men , a pattern seen when resistance to fluoroquinolone developed in the mid 2000s .  but today , there are no other options left to fight the bacteria if the cephalosporins fail .  that 's why new drugs are so important , the cdc 's bolan said .  " new treatments are urgently needed , and will ultimately be our best defense against the threat of the emergence of untreatable gonorrhea , " she said .  the cdc is urging the private sector to prioritize the discovery of new treatments , as there is only one new drug treatment currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline and only one clinical trial under way to test existing drugs against the infection .  avery 's recommendations in the meantime are pretty low-tech :  " do n't get it , and you do n't have to worry about it and have only one partner . get tested .
