<h> Gonorrhea becoming resistant to last available class of antibiotics <p> Comstock Images Gonorrhea used to be easily treated with a single pill . Now , to delay resistance to the last antibiotic available to treat it , the CDC is recommending against the oral drug and pushing an injectable antibiotic in its place . <p> CLEVELAND , Ohio-- There may soon come a time when there is no effective treatment available for gonorrhea , a sexually transmitted infection , or STI , that until recently had been easily cured with oral antibiotics . <p> Resistance to the last class of antibiotics available to treat the disease has been showing up in populations around the world , and will likely soon follow in the United States . <p> " We believe it is only a matter of time until gonorrhea develops resistance to this last remaining treatment option , " said Dr.Gail Bolan , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Division of STD Prevention in a telebriefing recentlyannouncing new treatment guidelines for gonorrhea . <p> The CDC is now discouraging the use of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . The agency is instead advocating the use of an injectable drug in the same antibiotic class , called ceftriaxone , in combination with one oftwo other oral antibiotics ( azithromycin ordoxycycline ) . <p> The CDC hopes the change will help delay the development of resistance in the United States . <p> Gonorrhea , which classically causes burning and pain during urination , is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States behind chlamydia , which dwarfs gonorrhea cases by a ratio of more than 4-to-1 . About 309,000 cases of gonorrheawere reported in 2010 nationally , and 2,700 of those cases were in Cuyahoga County , according to the CDCand the Cuyahoga County Board of Health . <p> Because the infection often causes mild or vague symptoms such as vaginaldischarge in women , or no symptoms at all , epidemiologists estimate that there are probably more than twice as many cases in the population as are reported . <p> Untreated infection in women can lead to serious side effects including pelvic inflammatory disease ( pain in the pelvis caused by infection of the uterus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic pelvic pain and miscarriage , said Dr.Ann Avery , an infectious-disease specialist at MetroHealth Medical Center . <p> The current treatment regimen , a single oral dose of an antibiotic , has been relatively easy to administer to patients . In some states , doctors can provide the patient with a dose of the antibiotic for the partner or write a prescription for a sexual partner who is reluctant to see a doctor but is also likely infected . <p> Anyone who takes an oral dose of antibiotic rather thanthe injectable treatment needs to be seen by a doctor a week afterward to see if his or herinfection has cleared and to be checked for antibiotic resistance . <p> The bacteria that causes gonorrhea , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , is notoriously good at adapting to avoid our attempts to kill it , said Dr. Robert Bonomo , professor of medicine , pharmacology , molecular biology and microbiology at Case Western Reserve University . <p> " Superstrains " of gonorrhea resistant to penicillin and tetracycline cropped up in the 1970s and ' 80s and to a class of drugs called fluoroquinolones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , a Japanese research group announced the discovery of a strain of gonorrhea that ca n't be killed by cephalosporins , the last class of antibiotics available . The strain , called H041 , was limited to a few people at the time , but has since spread to several other countries . <p> In the United States at the same time , the CDC released a report that showed a decrease in susceptibility of gonorrhea samples taken from sites across the country to cephalosporins . Resistance is measured with something called minimum inhibitory concentrations , or MICs -- an elevated MIC means it takes a higher dose of the drug to kill the bug . <p> While there were very few samples that showed a decreased susceptibility to cefixime at the time -- only 0.11 percent -- this number was up from only 0.02 percent during the last sampling period three years earlier . Now , that percentage is up to 1.5 percent for cefixime , and has increased from 0 percent to 0.4 percent for the injectable antibiotic ceftriaxone . <p> " This is a clear warning sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dr.Robert Kirkcaldy , medical epidemiologist with the CDC 's Division of STD Prevention , said in the telebriefing . <p> The most prominent MIC increases were in samples taken from the Western United States and from gay and bisexual men , a pattern seen when resistance to fluoroquinolone developed in the mid 2000s . <p> But today , there are no other options left to fight the bacteria if the cephalosporins fail . <p> That 's why new drugs are so important , the CDC 's Bolan said . <p> " New treatments are urgently needed , and will ultimately be our best defense against the threat of the emergence of untreatable gonorrhea , " she said . <p> The CDC is urging the private sector to prioritize the discovery of new treatments , as there is only one new drug treatment currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline and only one clinical trial under way to test existing drugs against the infection . <p> Avery 's recommendations in the meantime are pretty low-tech : <p> " Do n't get it , and you do n't have to worry about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have only one partner .
