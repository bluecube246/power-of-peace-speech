oliver stone 's latest attack on american capitalism - " wall street : money never sleeps " is finally hitting theaters april 2010 , twenty-three years after its predecessor . according to michael lewis , who interviewed the moviemaker for his latest vanity fair piece , stone 's biggest problem with the sequel was making a movie based on helplessly diabolical bankers , actually watchable .  lewis wrote that stone - an ardent left-wing ideologue , friendly acquaintance to fidel castro and hugo chavez , a moral relativist concerning hitler and stalin , and director of " w " and " platoon " - felt an obligation to reverse the societal damage and unintended consequences of the first installment .  " as a vehicle of change ... the movie was a catastrophe , " lewis wrote . it apparently inspired , rather than deterred , a generation of young men to enter the field and become the next gordon gekko ( the " diabolical money manager " played by michael douglas ) .  " i was shocked , truly shocked , when i went visit to shoot the sequel . " a million had become a billion dollars . they 'd replaced people of substance with people who made money . the volckers had become greenspans . "  lewis also interviewed douglas , who stars in the sequel as well . " we wanted to capture the hyper-materialism of the culture , " douglas said .  even by mainstream media and hollywood standards , lewis 's demonization of bankers and the financial industry is extreme . a sampling :  - " wall street firms have been destroyed by young men running out of control . "  - " gordon gekko does n't really even exist anymore ... he has become so ordinary -the hedge-fund manager - that he blends in with the landscape . "  - " on wall street , youth and innocence have long since divorced . "  - " it 's difficult to tell a story about the corruption of character when everyone in it is already corrupt . "  with " money never sleeps , " stone joins the long list of liberals and and unsustainable model called capitalism : " why did i go back ? because it 's important . it 's the collapse of capitalism and the collapse of our society . it is . our way of life is going to change .
