<p> A review unit sent out by Apple has managed to collect " incredibly minor " scratches on its back made of hardened glass after just a few days of heavy use . <p> Engadget was given a review unit of the iPhone 4 prior to this week 's public release . In its hands-on time with the device , the glass back panel managed to accumulate scratches , though the website dubbed them minor . <p> " It 's what we 'd call ' incredibly minor , ' not visible at all dead on , but in bright light at an angle ... well see for yourself ( in ) the photos , " it said . <p> When Apple introduced the iPhone 4 earlier this month , the Cupertino , Calif. , company touted that both the device 's front and back panels are made of aluminosilicate glass , chemically strengthened to be 30 times harder than plastic , and " more scratch resistant and more durable than ever . " The front and back glass are also said to include an oil-resistant coating that helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handset noted its durability , as Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal said " I dropped it several times from a few feet onto a hard surface with no problem , and it acquired no scratches in all my testing , even though I did n't use a case or coddle it . " <p> Ed Baig of USA Today also wrote that an Apple executive dropped the phone in front of him , for him to see . " The phone was undamaged , " he said . <p> In its teardown of the iPhone 4 , solutions provider iFixit found that the front glass on Apple 's latest handset is made of " Gorilla Glass . " It made no mention of the back panel . <p> " The front glass panel of the iPhone is constructed of Corning Gorilla Glass , a chemically strengthened alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass that is reported to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic , " the company said in its teardown . " Gorilla Glass holds many advantages as the iPhone 4 's front panel , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion-exchange chemical strengthening process . " <p> Apple will sell its first-ever set of iPhone protectors alongside the iPhone 4 , dubbed Bumpers . They will be available in 6 colors for $29.99 apiece , but the accessories do n't obscure the front or back of the handset , instead wrapping the handset 's edges in a shock-absorbing , rubberized material . <p> Earlier this month , one website came into possession of an iPhone 4 with a cracked glass front panel , challenging Apple 's own claims of the durability of the new hardware .
