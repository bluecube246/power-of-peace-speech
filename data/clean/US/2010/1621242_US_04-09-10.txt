We went out there and executed . " -- FSU coach Jimbo Fisher <p> " ( Oklahoma ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know it 's going to be tough going out there . We have to start from day one at Monday practice and get ready to go . " -- Quarterback Christian Ponder <p> " I was n't expecting two ( touchdown catches ) . Things just happened . I was in the right place at the right time and I got two , so I 'm really appreciative . " -- Fullback Lonnie Pryor <p> " I was so happy ( to run an offensive play ) . I had a big smile on my face . I should 've scored but it 's been about a year since I 've run the ball . I feel like I 'm ready for another chance . " -- Cornerback Greg Reid <p> " We had no doubt we were prepared for this , the training camps we went through showed out on the field . I 've been working on my pass-rush moves , getting bigger and stronger and tried to leave it all out on the field today . " -- Defensive tackle Demonte McAllister
