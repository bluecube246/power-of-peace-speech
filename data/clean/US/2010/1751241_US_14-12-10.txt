12 days of Groupon clones : BuyWithMe  BuyWithMe CEO Cheryl Rosner steps down  Updated 12/16/10 : Cheryl Rosner will be replaced temporarily by BuyWithMe 's CPO David Wolfe . Rosner will remain on the company 's advisory board .  I 'm always a little startled and disturbed when I see Groupon clones that really seem to have committed themselves wholeheartedly to copying every Groupon feature , down to the voice and style of writing . It 's creepy ... like finding out you accidentally slept with your spouse 's twin . Have n't we all been there ...  But there is something to be said for a company that musters up the nerve to shamelessly mimic another company down to the last detail . That takes spunk . So why not celebrate those companies with a 12 Days of Groupon Clones event ? Each day , VatorNews will feature one of the top Groupon clones .  Today 's Groupon clone : BuyWithMe , which happens to have news of its own today . CEO Cheryl Rosner stepped down Tuesday after being with skyrocketed this year , BuyWithMe has flatlined and Rosner , former president of Expedia , as well as the president and CEO of TicketsNow before it sold to TicketMaster in 2008 , will be leaving the company .  BuyWithMe was founded in March 2009 and has raised a total of $21.5 million from Matrix Partners and Bain Capital Ventures . In July , the New York-based company raised a whopping $16 million , which was used to expand BuyWithMe 's reach to more than two dozen cities throughout the United States . Earlier this year , the company operated in only five markets , but today it has footholds in 11 .  This is one of those companies that attempts to mirror Groupon 's subtle humor , but just ca n't seem to capture the irreverence . That 's the part I never get -- I understand wanting to copy the business model and everything else , but when companies copy the Groupon voice , I just feel embarrassed for them . It 's like coming out with a comedy about high school geeks trying to get laid . Porky 's and slapping your name on it .  What BuyWithMe DOES offer that differs ever so slightly from Groupon is a map showing the precise location of the business being featured . But other than that , it 's about what you would expect from a clone .
