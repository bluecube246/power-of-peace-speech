Death of man in custody at Onondaga County jail highlights mysterious condition  Provided photoRaul Pinet Jr . died Aug. 6 at the Onondaga County Justice Center jail . His death , attributed to cocaine-induced excited delirium , has been ruled a homicide .  A brain disorder , cocaine and police restraint -- they were all at play when Raul Pinet Jr . died in custody three weeks ago , according to the Onondaga County medical examiner .  In a short news release last week , Dr. Robert Stoppacher cited those causes but made no mention of the manner of Pinet 's death -- accident , suicide , natural or homicide .  It was a homicide caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome , according to Pinet 's death certificate . Homicide is rarely used to classify such deaths , according to experts .  The weight that each of the three factors played in Pinet 's death after arriving at the Onondaga County Justice Center jail will be examined by four investigations and a possible lawsuit .  At the center of the debate 's a condition that was first noted under another name in 1849 in mentally ill people , then resurfaced in the 1980s with the popularity of cocaine .  Neither Stoppacher nor District Attorney William Fitzpatrick would explain the rationale behind calling Pinet 's Aug. 6 death a homicide , nor the weight given to each of the three contributing factors .  View full sizeRaul Pinet Jr . ' s death certificate . His home address has been removed per the family 's request .  Even the country 's top experts ca n't agree on the basics of excited delirium : whether it should be classified as homicide or accidental , whether it 's a brain condition that 's genetic or caused by frequent drug abuse , or whether it even exists .  The forensic pathologist credited with first noting the syndrome in the mid-1980s , Dr. Charles Wetli , said such deaths should never be classified as homicides . They should be called accidental , as a drug overdose would be , because part of the syndrome is the brain 's response to the frequent use of examiner who 's in private practice in New Jersey .  The struggle with police is also part of the syndrome , Wetli said . In the few cases where victims died when not restrained , they died after jumping off a bridge , running into traffic or drowning in a lake , Wetli said . When police do get involved , they 're caught in a dilemma , he said .  " If they do n't restrain him , the guy runs out in traffic and is killed , and the cop gets blamed for not restraining him , " Wetli said . " If the cop does restrain him and he dies , the cop gets blamed for killing him because he restrained him . For the poor cop , it 's a no-win situation . "  Dr. Vincent DiMaio , a former San Antonio medical examiner who wrote a book on excited delirium , says such deaths should be classified as homicides because they almost always involve police restraint .  But the public often mistakenly holds police responsible because their intervention comes right before death to the normal physiological reactions of the body to stress and drugs , DiMaio wrote in the book he co-authored with his wife , Theresa .  " Essentially , it 's an overdose of adrenaline , " Vincent DiMaio said in an interview .  Deborah Mash , a neurology professor at the University of Miami who has studied excited delirium for 20 years , said such deaths are rarely called homicides . Of the 105 she 's studied at the school 's Excited Delirium Education , Research and Information Center , all were classified accidental , Mash said .  David Lassman / The Post-StandardThe death of Raul Pinet Jr . that occurred earlier this month at the Onondaga County Justice Center jail , 555 South State St. , Syracuse , has been ruled a homicide caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome .  Pinet 's death certificate says he died from sudden cardiac arrest caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome . It lists " prone restraint " as a significant condition contributing to death but not related to the cardiac arrest .  In a section asking for Philip wrote , " complications of use of illicit drug and confrontation with law enforcement . " Philip is the pathologist in the medical examiner 's office who performed the autopsy .  The death certificate does not spell out how homicide was determined to be the manner of death . Homicide means another person caused someone 's death , but not always criminally . Pinet 's death will likely be a justifiable homicide , Sheriff Kevin Walsh said .  " That 's what we 're looking at from our standpoint , " Walsh said . His office has completed its investigation and sent its findings to the district attorney 's office .  " It was justified because our use of force was within the law and was within the policy , " he said . The deputies had to use force because Pinet was struggling so violently , Walsh said . Other agencies investigating are the district attorney 's office , Syracuse Police Department and the state Commission of Correction .  A Syracuse police spokesman could not be reached to disclose the status of that agency 's Janet Izzo , said she could n't comment on the medical examiner 's ruling because she has n't seen the autopsy report . Pinet 's widow , Tashara Pinet , plans on filing a claim against the county and the Syracuse Police Department to preserve her right to sue , Izzo said .  The sheriff 's office determined deputies acted properly , Walsh said . No deputies ever got on Pinet 's back to subdue him , Walsh said . They used three emergency restraint belts -- one around his shoulders and arms to avoid chest compression , one around his hips to avoid pushing his diaphragm into his lungs , and one to hold his legs , Walsh said .  " Everything was done as safely as possible to control somebody who 's in a cocaine-induced excited delirium situation , " Walsh said .  Pinet was released from state prison in June after serving half of an 18-month sentence on a drug conviction . He served a two-to-six year prison sentence ending in 2005 for another drug conviction .  After Syracuse police arrested Pinet on a with officers , police said . When he arrived at the jail , he continued to fight , police said .  Deputies got the restraint belts around him and placed him in a padded room , Walsh said . When they cut the belts and his clothes off of him , Pinet was still struggling , Walsh said . Walsh said he did not know whether Pinet was still conscious when deputies left the room .  Deputies observed Pinet for four to five minutes in the room before realizing something was wrong , Walsh has said .  Mash 's research shows that people with excited delirium have a faulty brain regulation of the heart . The brain chemistry goes chaotic and that leads to a fatal arrhythmia , because the brain controls the heart , she said . So it 's a neuro-cardiac event , she said .  The syndrome limits the brain 's ability to develop a tolerance for a drug such as cocaine , Wetli said . When that person goes on a binge , the brain gets overwhelmed with dopamine , and he or drug 's effects the way most people can , he said .  Mash has seen some cases where someone died without police involvement , and others without drug involvement . But most have those contributing factors , she said . She believes the condition is genetic .  " The way I look at this is you 're walking around with a loaded gun , " said Mash , who has studied under a federal grant through the National Institute on Drug Abuse . " That gun may never fire . But if you use drugs , or have these other contributing environmental issues , you 've cocked that gun , you 've put the bullet in the chamber . "  Police often are wrongly held responsible , simply because they 're the ones applying the necessary restraint to the out-of-control subject , she said .  " Look , nobody would even have been there if the person was n't in the state of excited delirium , " Mash said . " And , by the way , what are the police supposed to do ? "  of excited delirium , to look for markers that would confirm that as the cause . Often medical examiners ask for her help , but she said she has not yet heard from Onondaga County officials .  Stoppacher found that Pinet 's cocaine use caused him to become disoriented , agitated and violent . It was apparently the first time someone 's death was attributed to excited delirium in Onondaga County , Walsh said .  The excited delirium label has drawn mixed acceptance among forensic pathologists . Some say it 's used as a scapegoat for deaths caused by police .  Dr. Werner Spitz , the former medical examiner in Detroit , said these types of cases should be labeled homicides because the officers , not the cocaine , cause the deaths .  " The only reason cocaine plays a role in so many of these cases is that it brings the police , " Spitz said . He reviewed Stoppacher 's news release about his findings in Pinet 's death .  " It would seem to me that he strongly suspects the inability to breathe Spitz said .  Fitzpatrick said he 'll review the evidence and decide whether to present the case to a county grand jury . His office is also investigating the Nov. 12 death of inmate Chuniece Patterson at the jail , he said . She died of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy .
