<h> A tale of two countries : Colombia and Venezuela <p> Colombia -- a nation perhaps best known to most Americans for drug exports -- has made remarkable progress in the last decade from improved security to economic growth . It stands in stark contrast to neighboring Venezuela . <p> On Aug. 7 , Juan Manuel Santos assumed the presidency of Colombia . It is a testimony to the strength of Colombian democracy that despite the immense popularity of outgoing president Alvaro Uribe , the Supreme Court ruled that Uribe could not run for a third term . <p> Juan Manuel Santos was sworn in as president of Colombia on Aug. 7 . <p> The terrorist , narco-trafficking FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , once thought to be within range of taking the capital , are now on the defensive . <p> The nation 's economy weathered the 2009 financial crisis and is showing remarkable growth , aided by $10 billion annual foreign investment , rapidly growing exports , a boom in tourism , a bullish stock market , the lowest inflation in six decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , the country is still a work in progress . The FARC have n't been eliminated as a threat to security , gangs have emerged , and while the production of cocaine has been reduced by 60 percent since 2000 , it still feeds the international market and the violence and corruption we see in Mexico and Central America . <p> Unemployment is down to 11 percent from nearly 20 percent a decade ago , but poverty remains high , and the income distribution among the worst in the world . These sobering facts for Latin America 's longest-running democracy need to be addressed by Santos . <p> However , Colombia shines brightly compared with neighboring Venezuela . There the militarized populism of Hugo Chavez has created economic chaos and repression . <p> Flush with billions of petrodollars coming from the wallets of American drivers , Venezuela is a study in incompetence , inflation , crime and corruption . In the last two years , water , electricity and food have been rationed . <p> The Venezuelan murder rate is one of the highest in the world . Billions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , badly conceived projects and aid to bolster such political , social and economic disasters as Cuba and Nicaragua . Recently , some 130,000 tons of food rotted in government warehouses . More than one million Venezuelans have left the country . <p> Yet Chavez dreams of global ambitions , purchasing sophisticated military equipment from Russia and consorting with the likes of Iran . Venezuela is now a main transit for cocaine bound to the United States and Europe . <p> In July , Colombia brought strong evidence to the Organization of American States that Venezuela is harboring elements of the FARC . Playing the victim , Chavez responded by breaking diplomatic relations with Bogota and ordering troops to the border . <p> Though diplomatic relations have been re-established , the bluster is intended to distract from Venezuela 's failures and put the opposition on the defensive for next month 's parliamentary elections . <p> Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez . ( AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos ) <p> Venezuela is a democracy in name only . There are no checks and balances on Chavez . He controls the Legislature and judiciary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assails the Church , and requires that Marxism be taught in private and public schools . The government manipulates the rules for political activity to prevent the opposition from winning office . <p> Moreover , thousands of Cuban operatives have infiltrated the intelligence and security apparatus . In this age of foolishness and wisdom , Chavez 's politics promise class conflict , corruption and war mongering . With all its troubles , Colombia has the better future and is a strong ally of the United States . <p> It would be a travesty if Congress does not pass the free trade agreement with Colombia that will benefit Americans and Colombians . Compare that to how our petrodollars subsidize imperial schemes , corruption and repression in Venezuela . <p> Abelardo Lechter is president of LEFA International based in King of Prussia , and chairman of the board of the Pan American Association of Philadelphia .
