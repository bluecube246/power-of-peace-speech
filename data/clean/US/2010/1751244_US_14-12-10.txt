<h> Amazing Race Winners Discuss Making History <p> It took 17 seasons but an all-female team finally finished first on The Amazing Race . Los Angeles doctors Nat Strand , 31 , and Kat Chang , 35 , spoke with PEOPLE about the highs and lows of their history-making run and why the experience means so much more than the money . ( Not that being able to pay off medical school debt is n't also putting a smile on their face . ) <p> Does it feel good to finally be able to talk about making history ? Nat : It was harder in the beginning but after a month it got easy . I almost forgot it had happened in real life . Kat : At first , you want to tell everyone . We 've had to keep the secret for about six months . But it was fun for our friends and family to go along for the ride and get nervous . <p> Did the chance to be the first all-female team to win motivate you ? Nat : We always play hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female winners . We just wanted to race in a classy , graceful fashion and do our best . The fact that we 're the first female-female team to win is an extra honor . Kat : We both love the show and we 'd still have wanted to do it even if a female team had won before . <p> What is it about your team that allowed you to finish first ? Kat : We 've worked together before in many situations where we have to try to get a specific task done often under stressful circumstances . That 's a very different dynamic than being related or dating . Nat : We 're pretty equal partners . We have a similar level of physical fitness , similar backgrounds and we think the same way . It made it easy to work together . There was definitely not a feeling of one person carrying the other in any way . I know what helps Kat and what does n't and likewise . We also handle fatigue and stress daily as doctors . <p> It seemed important to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy active diabetic that was n't letting the disease set limitations in my life . I got emails throughout the show from mothers of newly diagnosed kids . One wrote me that her daughter had only been diabetic for four days and they watched the show together in the hospital . She said , " Look at her . She does n't look any different than other racers . " Those kinds of messages are important to get out there . <p> What was your favorite place or challenge ? Nat : When we were in Ghana in second-to-last place , trying to get that coffin to the warehouse , suddenly on that busy African highway all these kids gathered together to show us the way . We were running in a pack , laughing and smiling -- Kat : As we were carrying a giant lobster coffin . We are on the verge of being eliminated but it was so ridiculous and cool that we had to take a moment to laugh . <p> What was the hardest moment ? Kat : Eating the sheep 's head as a vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest leg was Oman in large part because we used the map that was misleading and we went the wrong direction for about six hours . Fortunately , Gary and Mallory had the same map and were seven hours behind . Nat : If I ever have to drive a stick around the deserts of Oman again , it will be too soon . <p> That also speaks to how even a good team needs luck to win.Nat:The Race is like life . Some people get good luck and some bad and in the end , it is usually a fair shake . A lot of it is how you get yourself out of a bad situation . You have to avoid huge mistakes and recovering from bad luck like a flat tire . Kat : And sometimes you have to count on others having bad luck . <p> Do patients recognize you ? Kat : In the last couple of weeks , pretty much everyday one or two patients recognize me . It 's uncomfortable because we 're private people , but it has been made easier by how nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to appointments with cameras and things for me to sign and bring their kids .
