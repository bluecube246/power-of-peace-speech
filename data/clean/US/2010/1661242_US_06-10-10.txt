should critical reviews of artprize finalists run on mlive.com ?  rex larsen the grand rapids pressdavid spriggs with this top 10 piece " vision , " at the grand rapids art museum . the piece was chosen by two critics on mlive to fall in the top four .  mlive.com and the grand rapids press recently ran two reviews from art critics about the top 10 artprize finalists , and some readers have taken offense .  each critic - roger green and joseph becherer - is well qualified to write about art .  coincidentally or not , they both chose the same four pieces to come out on top : " cavalry , american officers 1921 , " " vision , " " lure/forest " and " salt and earth : garden for patricia . "  green , who teaches art history at eastern michigan university and was booth newspapers ' art critic for 15 years , went a step further and ranked the pieces . he chose chris laporte 's " cavalry " as his winning piece , and put mia becherer is chief curator and vice president for collections and exhibitions at frederik meijer gardens &amp; sculpture park and a professor of art history at aquinas college .  despite the critics ' qualifications , some users took offense to the fact that we asked critics to pick winners and losers .  check out the comments and then let us know - are critical reviews and picking winners and losers appropriate as we near the final artprize voting deadline ? do they sway voters ? or will voters pick who they want anyway ?  i personally do not care for an art critic 's opinion . i feel that their so called ' educated ' opinions are shallow and meanspirited . sometimes ' years of experience ' is n't a good thing . artprize is for all people and those who vote will make the best choice regardless of any sappy , saccharine comments that turn people away . my request to mlive and all news media individuals is no more art critic comments . if people wanted them , they would ask .  drawknife said : i about van gogh if he had been a contemporary ? frankly i 'm amazed at all the whining about art prize . it 's a gift ! enjoy it !  muse responded : i agree ! clearly , some pieces of work are more involved and " original " than others , but the important thing is the process , individuals tapping into their own creative spirit , and what this event brings to the grand rapids community . i 'd have to bet that even the art critics out there started with a box of crayons and a coloring book .  i find it interesting that artprize and its democratic process for deciding what is best in show was enthusiastically celebrated by the media , yet when the results come in there is all this ringing of hands over the consequence . mr. becherer is a thoughtful writer ( i totally disagree with him , however , over la porte 's work being worthy of any prize . it strikes me as one of the most cynical pieces of art in the museum , since all it really that has been projected/enlarged onto paper . college drawing project 101 . and then there is his patriotic subject matter and it 's appeal to voters . talk about manipulative ! it completely insulates him from criticism. ) , but why should any one person , regardless of their expertise , be given any privileged " soapbox " ? is n't the point of artprize that everyone is an expert and no one should be telling anyone how to vote ? is n't it contradictory for the press to be weighing in on the process at all ?
