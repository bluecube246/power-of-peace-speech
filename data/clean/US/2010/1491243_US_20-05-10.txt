<h> Related Links <p> Natasha moved to Chicago from Eastern Europe a year and a half ago with a visa and a vision of what America would be like . But that vision quickly disintegrated . <p> The nanny job she had secured turned ugly when they stopped paying her on time and started asking her to do things she was n't comfortable with . Finally , feeling as though she had no other options , she quit and started the job search anew . <p> " The job was not working at all , " said Natasha , who requested her real name be withheld . " But then I had no money and I got desperate because I did n't want to leave . " <p> One of her Eastern European friends mentioned a Chicago-area spa owner who was hiring masseuses and provided great perks : a free apartment , a car and a job . So she decided to give it a try . But things went downhill , again . <p> " After a few months he stopped paying me , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do what he said . He would hit me . I was so scared . He told me if I tried to escape he would find me . " <p> The business only employed Eastern European girls , both legal and illegal . Natasha said he was sexually and physically abusive . <p> " We were n't allowed to talk to each other or anyone else , " she said . " We were trapped . " <p> Natasha was afraid to approach the police -- she did n't know how they would react or whether they could help her . And she was afraid of getting sent back to Europe , even though she still had a valid visa . <p> Natasha is not alone . Many immigrants , legal and otherwise , are afraid to approach the police or report crimes against them , said Richard Hanus , a Chicago area immigration lawyer . <p> " It 's a new system , a new society , and in addition to being intimidated and overwhelmed , there 's a shame that also comes with being victimized , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself or people in your community that you have been taken . " <p> It 's especially scary for immigrants when the crime involves their employment , said Dianne Enriquez , worker center network coordinator for Interfaith Worker Justice . The national group organizes a network of low-wage worker groups for non-union sectors . <p> There were about 1.4 million worker-aged immigrants in 2008 , according to the Brookings Institute , a Washington , D.C.-based think tank . <p> With the encouragement of an American friend , Natasha fled her situation and went to the police . She also persuaded fellow workers to come forward and tell their story . <p> Her boss , Alex A. Campbell , and his associate Danielle John allegedly demanded thousands of dollars from a spa worker for help with her immigration papers and threatened her with other punishments if she did not pay more than $30,000 total . <p> In the case , U.S. v. Campbell and John , Natasha 's former boss and co-worker face charges of conspiring and attempting to commit extortion , according to a Jan. 13 press release from U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the case . The attorney for Campbell , Hal Garfinkel , was out of town and unable to be reached for comment ; John 's attorney , Christina Farley Jackson , was also unable to be reached for comment . <p> And now that Natasha 's former boss is in prison and awaiting a June 2 hearing , she feels safer . <p> They helped her find a safe place to stay , determine her immigration status and feel more secure , she said . <p> She is waiting to obtain a U-visa , a victim visa for witnesses in criminal cases . U-visas are not well-known by immigrants but they can safeguard victims wary of approaching the police , Hanus said , and are especially useful in situations when immigrants are nervous about their immigration status . <p> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS <p> The fear of seeking help is even greater for illegal immigrants , said Maureen Rowley Barnett , a Chicago psychologist that specializes in immigration issues . They live in a constant state of anxiety and are often targeted by criminals and other offenders because they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the price that they would pay is great enough to keep them away from the police and anything to do with the law , " she said . <p> Hanus agreed . Though without visas they do not necessarily have the right to stay here , illegal immigrants do have the constitutional rights to safety and property just like any American , he said . <p> And " police are charged with the responsibility of protecting you no less than protecting a person that is documented , " he said . <p> Though most situations are not as dramatic as Natasha 's , worker abuse is widespread among immigrants , experts said . <p> Wage theft , discrimination and abuse are the main problems seen at Interfaith Worker Justice , Enriquez said . <p> She has heard stories of employees not allowed to use the restroom or being forced to relieve themselves outside . Construction , restaurant and domestic workers most often face these situations , she said . <p> Elena , who also did n't want her real name used , is an illegal immigrant who was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is fighting wage theft against two previous employers with the help of ARISE Chicago Worker Center . The organization provided her with the knowledge of her rights that gave her the confidence to fight , she said . <p> " I did n't have any fear , " she said . " If they 're going to deport me they will . " <p> A job at a local restaurant promised her $300 for 12 hours a day , six days a week . The boss began assigning her tasks outside of her job description and refused her pay for six months . <p> Paid in cash and no paperwork means Elena does n't have proof to support her case . <p> But when she learned about ARISE through English classes she takes at her church , she decided to take action . <p> " They showed me the rights that corresponded to me , " she said . <p> While unemployed , Elena worked a few side jobs , including a cleaning job where she encountered another wage theft situation . Her cases are being reviewed by the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She suggests uniting with other coworkers when a case against an employer occurs . <p> " I think unfortunately Hispanics are fearful and we 're ignorant in terms our rights , " she said . " Hopefully those who 've been through similar circumstances will share with others the knowledge they 've acquired so that there is less injustice in the community . " <p> The majority seeking help at ARISE are immigrants but citizenship status questions are n't asked . <p> Anna Karewicz , Polish organizer for ARISE , tells immigrants they should n't acknowledge threats of deportation since employers are often breaking the law themselves . <p> " Threatening employers with calling immigration is usually just a scare tactic that employers use , " Karewicz said , adding that the employers are breaking the law by hiring someone who is undocumented . <p> " Workers have rights , " she said . " They need to know that they do and they need to stand up for their rights . "
