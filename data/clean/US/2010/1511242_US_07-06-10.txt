the risks of fiction : on the new yorker writers under 40 list  back in 2003 , i decided to start reading the fiction in the new yorker consistently . up until that point , i 'd read the weekly fiction offering only if it happened to be something by a writer i particularly liked .  part of my motivation had to do with my own ambitions as a fiction writer ; another part had to do with my high school teaching job , which included a course in reading and writing fiction . i thought maybe , by studying closely what the magazine was publishing , i 'd get a better sense of just why my own stories were getting unceremoniously rejected everywhere i sent them ( with the minor exception of a brief but kind note scribbled at the bottom of a form rejection from mcsweeney 's . ) if not , at least i 'd maybe come away with some good stories to teach in class .  in the first few months of the project , i encountered some great pieces ( an excerpt from his novel old school ) , maile meloy 's " red from green , " and lara vapnyar 's " love lessons , mondays , 8 a.m . " and i found that , having preemptively committed myself to reading each story , i sat down with a helpful patience , an openness to the experience and to the writer 's art .  the summer of that first year , i went back to an old issue i 'd kept tucked away on a shelf -- the one dated june 21 &amp; 28 , 1999 . this issue was designed by rock-star book designer chip kidd . ( incidentally , it 's the only issue in the magazine 's history whose pages have artwork that bleeds to the edges . ) the cover features an illustration of chris ware 's character jimmy corrigan on a beach , looking out at the sea . scrolled down the page are twenty first sentences -- from stories written by the twenty authors chosen to represent what editor bill buford , in his introductory comment , called " the twenty names and the not-so-obvious , those who are only just now crossing a threshold of literary recognition and those who have been at home in it for some time . "  i 'd dipped into this issue when it first came out . i had liked the sherman alexiepiece and the david foster wallaceone , but set the magazine aside after being unmoved by a couple of the others . now , though , i dug back in and found more to like -- a tense and mysterious story by chang-rae lee , a wicked little one by antonya nelson , and soberly masterful stories by edwidge danticat and jhumpa lahiri . i found that the issue included an excerpt from tony earley 's gentle , pitch-perfect jim the boy , a novel which i 'd read and loved .  over the next seven years , i continued to read the new yorker fiction fairly regularly . some years i read more or less everything , while other years i took in only about half of the stories . i began to catalog my reactions in a spreadsheet . . i made up enough bonus-reading quizzes on stories i liked that i was able to offer one per day to my reading and writing fiction students . i sat down and formulated my own criteria for evaluating fiction . i branched out into other sources of fiction , subscribing to smaller magazines like epoch , the gettysburg review , and the virginia quarterly review .  i came to recognize , though , that reading magazine fiction is a crapshoot . i think that 's why many new yorker readers rarely read this part of the magazine . when you read a piece of nonfiction , you know what you 're getting into , and you know you 'll come away from the experience with something tangible -- some information or perspective on the world . and you can stop midway through and still have something to take with you . fiction does n't work that way , at least for me . it 's like sex -- uncomfortable if abandoned midway through . the rewards of fiction -- the ecstatic transport when you 're pulled into the world of -- can be greater than those of nonfiction , but you can also finish a story angry that the writer has just wasted 45 minutes of your life that you 'll never get back .  given the risks involved in reading a piece of fiction , it helps to have someone whose taste you trust to limit the pool . larry dark became that type of guide for me in the o. henry prize collections from 1997 to 2002 , which include dozens of stories that blew me away . the new yorker fiction editors serve the same purpose . though i do n't dispute that stories are published in smaller magazines that i would like better than a healthy percentage of the stories published in the new yorker , i simply do n't have time to read all those little magazines . the new yorker 's batting average is high enough -- and it publishes enough heavy-hitters -- that it 's as good a section as any to stand in if you hope to catch a home run .  as the literary critic barbara herrnstein smith has argued an arbitrariness on both a personal and a society-wide level . yet we naturally make such judgments . we have to do so , simply to avoid being drowned by the deluge of written material that swamps us . our literary judgments also help us define ourselves and our culture . who am i ? what do i like , and why ? what vision of the world do i share ? and who are we ? what do we value ? what stories do we want to hear about ourselves , what will our culture admit into its awareness ?  so that 's the context in which i 'm approaching this week 's new yorker , in which the fiction editors offer , eleven years later , a new group of 20 writers , all under 40 years of age , as the future of fiction in america . it 's an effort to shape a literary culture . and it 's an effort by people whose taste i generally trust .  overall , though , the new list does n't immediately excite me , i must say of stories that i greatly admire , and several of the others have written stories that i thought were good . but , to return to the sexual metaphor of reading fiction , with some of the other writers on the list i 've had one-night stands and never hooked up again . others , sad to say , have fallen victim to episodes of literary coitus interruptus .  the fact is , this past year i 've gotten a bit impatient with new yorker fiction . busy with other reading projects , i 've slipped back into my old habits -- reading onlystories whose authors particularly grabbed my interest .  but -- and this is another danger of magazine fiction -- it 's all too easy to misjudge a writer harshly simply on the basis of one story . like the 1999 issue , this one , i hope , will redirect my attention to worthy writers whom i may have unfairly written off .  despite the periodic disappointments of reading fiction in magazines , there 's a unique magic to the experience . there 's the writers . there 's the joy of beginning a story by a writer you 've never read and suddenly realizing that you 're encountering something great . it 's like being struck by lightning , set suddenly afire with pleasure . no other reading experience can turn a chance hour into sheer delight in quite this way .  say what you will , the new yorker is one of our culture 's most stalwart curators of this type of literary experience . for that reason , its editors ' vision of the future of fiction is worth considering . it 's my hope that , like the 1999 issue , the 2010 version will include some surprising treats that open up new readerly enthusiasms for me .  post a response  comments with unrelated links will be deleted . if you 'd like to reach our readers , consider buying an advertisement instead .  anonymous and pseudonymous comments that do not add to the conversation will be deleted at our discretion .  namee-mailwebsite ( optional ) comment  the rewards of fiction can be greater than that 're pulled into the world of a story , given a new window into human experience -- but you can also come away from a story angry that the writer has just wasted 45 minutes of your life .
