the three types of sharing  russell davies shares some interesting ideas on his blog as an addition to his recent lift talk . davies dissects the act of sharing into three categories -- sharing goods , sharing services , and sharing information . sharing goods , davies claims , is the most difficult form of sharing because giving away a physical item is immediately noticeable . sharing services does n't consist of losing tangible objects , but it can be considered an inconvenience . sharing information , like giving directions , is n't an inconvenience and does n't constitute loss of goods or time . thus , it is in our human nature to like to share information .  he explains :  " sharing physical goods is psychically harder than sharing information because goods are more valuable . and , therefore , presumably , the satisfactions of sharing them are greater . i bet there 's some sort of **25;0;toolong trick in there , physical things will always feel more valuable to us because that 's what we 're used to , that 's medium for music was introduced , the mode of sharing converted from physical sharing to information sharing . napster was one of the first to exploit the convenience resulting from this shift in sharing category .  mixtapes , davies mentions , have embedded value from the inconvenience of physical preparation , which explains why it is regarded more highly than digital playlists from spotify . davies believes that services such as the newspaper club are approaching the sweet spot of sharing -- where we get both the satisfactions of sharing a physical thing and the convenience of sharing information .
