arizona cancels schip program for lack of funds  arizona has become the first state to cancel its state children 's health insurance program , which , like other schip programs , is funded jointly by the state and the federal government .  the budget passed by the legislature and signed into law by republican governor janice k. brewer eliminates the $22.9-million program , known as kidscare , as of june 15th . the program served 38,000 children living in families with incomes between 100% and 200% of the federal poverty level ( $22,000 to $44,000 for a family of four ) .  a statement on the web site of the arizona health care cost containment system , the state 's medicaid agency , said simply , " the state does not have enough funds to keep paying its portion of this program . "  brewer proposed cutting the program in her " state of the state " address in january . " as an arizonan , as a mother , and as a person who feels great compassion for the vulnerable and less with great reluctance that i advocate a number of deep reductions in funding . . . . as governor , i have a duty to preserve state government 's fiscal integrity and to ensure arizona 's long-term health . "  the state faced a projected shortfall of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2011 .  arizona pediatricians were furious about the program 's cancellation . " our elected officials have said the budget deficit left them with no choice but to eliminate this coverage , but they did have a choice and they chose to put our children 's health at risk , deny them access to a medical home and critical preventive health services , " mary rimsza , md , chair of legislative affairs for the arizona chapter of the american academy of pediatrics , said in a statement . " this decision will increase healthcare costs by cost-shifting , overuse of emergency rooms , and lack of early intervention . "  roland goertz , md , president-elect of the american academy of family physicians , also said he was upset about the program 's cancellation . " care for children , " said goertz , who practices in waco , texas . " i do n't know that there 's any way possible for it not to impact the health of the children that are going to be no longer covered . "  some arizona physicians may have to turn away children who become uninsured as a result of losing schip coverage , he said . " the vast majority of physician practices are small businesses , and they have to make decisions based on whether the bottom line is met or not . . . . i think it 's going to happen because i do n't know a way it ca n't happen . "  goertz said he hoped other states would not follow in arizona 's path . because of the recession , " fiscal crises are unfortunately more common , but i hope they do n't go to the extreme that arizona has gone to . "  jenny sullivan , senior health policy analyst at families usa , said that there are several good reasons why states might not be inclined , it 's not popular to cut coverage for kids , so there 's a political price . "  but more importantly , she said , " from a financial perspective , it does n't save the state very much money , " because states only provide 35% of the funds for the program , and the rest comes from the federal government . " states without a doubt are in historic budget crises , but cutting schip is not necessarily the best way to save state funds . "  sullivan said she was hopeful that some stimulus programs that are giving states additional healthcare funds will be extended . " that will give states extra money for medicaid , which will help them with the general fund and give them more money for other things like schip , " she said .  sullivan also raised another possibility : the senate version of the healthcare reform bill , which is scheduled for a vote in the house on sunday , contains a " maintenance of effort " provision requiring states to maintain any children 's health programs that that situation , arizona would not be permitted to discontinue its schip program , she said .  medpagetoday is a trusted and reliable source for clinical and policy coverage that directly affects the lives and practices of health care professionals .  physicians and other healthcare professionals may also receive continuing medical education ( cme ) and continuing education ( ce ) credits at no cost for participating in medpage today-hosted educational activities .
