Thayer Evans of Fox Sports Continues His Witch Hunt Against ...

<p> Auburn 28 , Alabama 27 will go down as one of the most memorable Iron Bowls in the storied history of the rivalry . Cam Newton , who will in the Heisman , was brilliant in rallying the Tigers from a 24-0 deficit . With so many terrific storylines , why did Thayer Evans of Fox Sports produce this silly column about Newton not talking to the media ? <p> Auburn 's much-maligned defense produced at least two heroes -- Antonie Carter and Nick Fairley -- in the comeback win . Newton , whether he wins a title or not , has produced one of the best seasons any SEC QB has ever had . He proved that when bottled up on the ground , he can beat you through the air . His NFL stock continues to soar . The win virtually cemented Auburn 's spot in the National Championship game . The Tigers were n't even in the silly preseason Top 20 ! <p> All of which makes Evans ' jihad against Newton puzzling and frankly , disappointing . ( Evans , a highly-thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his early months at Fox in what appears to be some kind of ' look , I 'm worth my big contract ' display . ) What 's even more surprising is that other than Gregg Doyel of CBS Sports , nobody in the media ( or even all the bloggers who like to say they ' cover the media ' ) has called out Evans for this bizarre 6 week attack on Newton . <p> Evans has let you know he wo n't vote for Newton for Heisman , and does n't want you to , either . He 's written about 2-3 year old academic allegations that have no bearing on eligibility ( not to mention Mississippi St. knew about when it was recruiting Newton ) . Allegedly , Evans phoned enough professors at Auburn poking around about Newton that someone put Evans ' phone number on a message board . Ca n't wait to see how many Newton hit-pieces Evans churns out in the six weeks between the SEC Championship -- assuming Auburn defeats South Carolina -- and the National title game . <p> Did Evans really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talking to the media ? Not only was Auburn 28 , Alabama 27 college football 's game of the year , but it had to be one of the five greatest wins in the last 20 years of Auburn football . And you 're asking people about Cam Newton 's silence ? Auburn and all the participants in L'Affaire Newton have gone into bunker mode . Been that way for a couple weeks . <p> Here 's a simple , logical answer : Uh , there 's an investigation going on , and instead of fielding 37 questions about you-know-what , why not just ignore the questions altogether ?
