'Big Brother 12' Spoilers: Final 4 Power of Veto Results
http://www.buddytv.com/articles/big-brother/big-brother-12-spoiler-final-4-37982.aspx

<p> Now that Big Brother 12 is in the final 4 , the Power of Veto competition is the most important one . HoH only ensures you safety , but PoV keeps you safe , let 's you pick the nominees and let 's you pick who gets evicted . <p> SPOILER WARNING : This article contains Big Brother 12 spoilers . <p> Hayden is the HoH and he nominated Lane and Britney . <p> Hayden won the Power of Veto . <p> It seems the competition was about evicted HGs in previous challenges . The win solidifies two things . First , the nominations will stay the same and Britney will be evicted , leading to a dull Brigade final 3 . Second , there 's no way Lane or Enzo would bring Hayden to the finale . <p> With three HoH wins and now a Power of Veto victory , Hayden is proving that he 's in it to win it , playing hard now that winning actually matters . Combined with the fact that he 's already taking credit for getting Britney to backdoor Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , despite the show getting its best ratings yet , I suspect the final few episodes will have a sharp decrease due to lack of interest in the outcome . Just like when Dick and Danielle were the final two , having the Brigade in the finale means that it does n't really matter who wins . <p> Sure , Hayden deserves to win a little more , but all three members have the exact same argument for why they should win . They were all in the Brigade and so the number of competitions is the only real difference . Since Lane has one HoH and Enzo has one PoV , there 's no way either could catch Hayden for number of wins . <p> Normally I would say that Hayden would be smart to turn on the Brigade and get Enzo out , but it truly does n't matter . Hayden will win against anyone in the house and the only way for him to make the finale is to win the final HoH . This week 's eviction could n't matter less to him , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little easier than beating Britney and Lane . <p> On the bright side , there 's been talk about finally exposing the Brigade to Britney , so Saturday night 's Big Brother : After Dark could feature the revelation .
