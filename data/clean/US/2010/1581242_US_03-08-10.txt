but officers and other opponents say johnson 's past should preclude him from the post : he was convicted of second-degree murder in 1992 after he fatally shot a fellow teen at a party .  " i 've gotten more e-mails and phone calls about this issue than anything else since i 've been on the council -- all of it negative , " city council president pro tem gary brown , a former detroit police officer , told the detroit news last week . " i have serious concerns , because the board sets policy for the police department . "  but according to johnson , he 's already paid for his crime and , after earning a master 's degree in 2007 and sharing his story of rehabilitation as a motivational speaker , is ready to lead .  " the big issue is not what you have done , " johnson told wxyz in an interview that recently aired . " the big issue is what you are doing , and what you think you can do to help everybody in this when he ran for city council . his effort fell short , but the campaign served as an opportunity for him to tout his new life as a community leader . former police chief warren evans even praised johnson for spearheading neighborhood patrols to find a serial rapist and murder suspect .  " raphael johson is an example of someone who has made the most of a second opportunity , " deputy mayor saul green said in a statement last week .  but should his second opportunity be on the board of police commissioners ?
