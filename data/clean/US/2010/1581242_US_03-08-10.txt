But officers and other opponents say Johnson 's past should preclude him from the post : He was convicted of second-degree murder in 1992 after he fatally shot a fellow teen at a party .  " I 've gotten more e-mails and phone calls about this issue than anything else since I 've been on the council -- all of it negative , " City Council President Pro Tem Gary Brown , a former Detroit Police officer , told The Detroit News last week . " I have serious concerns , because the board sets policy for the Police Department . "  But according to Johnson , he 's already paid for his crime and , after earning a master 's degree in 2007 and sharing his story of rehabilitation as a motivational speaker , is ready to lead .  " The big issue is not what you have done , " Johnson told WXYZ in an interview that recently aired . " The big issue is what you are doing , and what you think you can do to help everybody in this when he ran for City Council . His effort fell short , but the campaign served as an opportunity for him to tout his new life as a community leader . Former Police Chief Warren Evans even praised Johnson for spearheading neighborhood patrols to find a serial rapist and murder suspect .  " Raphael Johson is an example of someone who has made the most of a second opportunity , " Deputy Mayor Saul Green said in a statement last week .  But should his second opportunity be on the Board of Police Commissioners ?
