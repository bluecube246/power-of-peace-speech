the next ipad will probably include a three-axis gyroscope sensor for a more accurate device positioning , according to an electronics industry news site . citing an analysis by ubm techinsights , ee times reported on wednesday that apple allegedly tested out invensense 's gyroscope with the 9.7-inch tablet , indicating plans to eventually add the sensor to a future ipad revision .  ubm techinsights ' product manager steve bitton tore apart an ipad and spotted an empty slot conveniently placed next to the device 's accelerometer ( it 's occupied by a gyro sensor on iphone 4 ) . this proves apple toyed with the gyro idea on ipad , bitton noted :  apple was possibly testing the idea of a gyroscope within the ipad and had done so using the itg-3200 by invensense as it was the first digital three-axis gyroscope to be released . apple probably chose to wait until the next iteration of the ipad to introduce gyroscope capabilities .  the news that apple is exploring its gyro options for ipad echoes a recent piece by macrumors . the next , should also include a gyroscope sensor .  apple opted for stmicroelectronics ' gyroscope in iphone 4 , which is a slightly revised version of their off-the-shelf l3g4200d chip . it 's a mems gyroscope , basically an electronics version of its vibrational counterpart . the mems gyroscope features a plate called the " proof mass " that oscillates when a drive signal is applied to the set of drive capacitor plates , much like halteres of insects .  the level of miniaturization is mind-blowing , as revealed by ifixit and chipworks who examined the st lypr540ah mems gyro ( not related to iphone 4 ) under a scanning electron microscope . the stunning shots included below are the testament to the engineering marvel and impossibly accurate manufacturing required to build these tiny sensors .  the gyro in iphone 4 senses pitch , roll , and yaw , while providing data on rotation about gravity . the sensor joins four other sensors in every iphone : the accelerometer , proximity sensor , ambient light sensor , and magnetic compass . " these phones are getting more and more the audience at the iphone 4 unveiling .  tying the accelerometer and even the magnetic compass together with the gyroscope enables six-axis motion sensing on iphone 4 via coremotion apis in ios 4 . as a result , games optimized for iphone 4 enjoy far more accurate tilt controls . excellent examples of gyro-enabled games include ngmoco 's eliminate:gunrange and gameloft 's n.o.v.a . -- near orbit vanguard alliance , seen in the below video .
