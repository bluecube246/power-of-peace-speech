inc. 5000 applicant of the week : brooklyn brewery  as we process applications for the 2010 inc. 500 5000 , we thought it would be worthwhile to shine a spotlight on some of the companies that are vying to appear on our ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in the u.s. one that caught our eye was the new york city-based brookyln brewery .  during his time as a war correspondent for the associated press , steve hindy 's interest in home brewing was sparked by a group of american diplomats he met while he was working in the middle east . since the diplomats were stationed in saudi arabia , where it is illegal to buy alcohol under islamic law , they had grown skilled at brewing beer in their homes .  a few years after his first foray into illicit home brewing , hindy 's wife grew fed up with him working in the line of fire , so he came home and took a job with newsday . soon though , the brewing bug overpowered him and he talked his neighbor jobs together to launch a brewery .  potter , who has since cashed out of the business , was initially skeptical of the idea . " when i started talking about starting a brewery , tom thought i was crazy because his idea of the beer industry was that the big brewers were getting bigger and the small breweries were being stamped out , " says hindy .  when potter attended the microbrewers conference in portland , oregon in 1986 , there were only about 25 microbreweries in the country , compared to over 400 today . over the next two years , he and hindy managed to raise half a million dollars from family and friends and in 1988 , on their first day of sales , they were able to move 100 cases of beer .  much like serving as a war correspondent , " starting a business requires every bit of imagination , and creativity , and energy , and gumption that you 've got , " hindy says . " you really have to be able to think on your feet and your plan eventually , after getting some positive local press , the brewery started getting courted by advertising and pr firms as well as venture capitalists hoping to get involved . hindy learned quickly that " when you get a little bit of success , all sorts of opportunities arise and most of them are mirages , they 're not really opportunities that you should follow . "  instead , hindy carved his own path . unlike other american craft breweries , brooklyn brewery sells a substantial portion of its beer overseas . he attributes this to the positive associations people have with the borough from which the brand 's name is borrowed . however , in the early years , friends and investors were dubious of the choice .  " i do n't think they saw what i saw , which was all sorts of creative people were pouring into brooklyn and it just seemed to me that brooklyn was kind of this mythical place in america that had a lot of positive associations attached to it . "  hindy 's observation paid off : the company 's revenue million in 2009.
