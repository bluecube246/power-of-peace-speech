<h> iPod Nano 's exposure to heavy rain motive behind runner 's act of insitutional vandalism against the city of Bethlehem <p> Although my waistline and lungs have n't recognized yet , I 'm back in training for my third half-marathon . This is the first time I 'll be venturing outside the Lehigh Valley to run 13.1 miles . The race is scheduled for October in Baltimore . <p> The regimen requires at least four days of running a week leading up to the race . I knew this week was going to be a busy one so getting out for a run on Monday night was paramount . <p> View full sizeAP Photo/Paul Sakuma ) Apple CEO Steve Jobs talks about the new iPod Nano at an Apple event last year in San Francisco . <p> I arrived home with the intention of logging at least three miles come hell or high water . <p> Well , one of those two did come , and , to give you a clue as to which one , it did n't at all involve flames , pitchforks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some Springsteen on my iPod Nano while keeping a brisk pace on a cool and misty evening . It was when I reached the turn around point at Broad and Linden streets in Bethlehem , about a mile and a half from my home that the skies opened up . <p> As my father-in-law recently said in describing a thunderstorm that washed out a golf outing , the rains were n't just torrential , they were biblical . <p> That may be a bit of exaggeration in Monday night 's case , but for a guy in a T-shirt and shorts with no pockets and an expensive electrical device exposed to the elements , the situation felt biblical . <p> I did what I could to save the iPod by running faster than I 've ever ran while keeping the device under my palm and holding up my arm in a steady fashion . <p> It reached the point where I did n't think the iPod was going to make it so I sought coverage under the awning near Starfish Brasserie at Broad and Guetter streets . Once I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional vandalism . <p> Now , before the Bethlehem Police Department seeks a warrant for my arrest , I 'd like to reiterate that these iPods are n't cheap , and we 're in harsh economic times . <p> Also , the cost of the damage I caused to taxpayers is negligible at best . <p> All I did was rip off a piece of the plastic trash bag lining the outside of a city-owned trash can . Admittedly , the action was kind of gross , but I was desperate . I wrapped the piece of the bag around the iPod and continued my sprint in the rain . <p> When I finally arrived home , my wife was at the front door with her car keys in hand . She indicated she was just about to hop in her car to go on a rescue mission when she saw me emerge from the street corner . <p> The iPod was still pumping Springsteen through the headphones by the time I spilled into our living room . The trash-bag method had apparently worked . <p> I still felt like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge to perform some kind of miniature version of CPR , but those thoughts dissipated after a hot shower and some dry clothes . <p> Four days have passed since the storm . My sneakers are still wet . I 've also found myself spending more time than usual staring at the local radar on weather.com , but at least I can do it while still listening to my iPod.
