<h> Scientist finds evidence of pre-Big Bang events <p> A leading Oxford University cosmologist says he has been able to observe the effects of cosmic events that preceded the Big Bang . <p> Roger Penrose says that by examining the cosmic microwave background radiation , he 's discovered echoes of events before the Big Bang that 's generally believed to have kicked off our universe . <p> Penrose says that black hole encounters prior to the Big Bang would leave an observable affect on our own universe , in the form of concentric circles around galaxy clusters within which there would be anomolously low variation in temperature . <p> Penrose has long posited the idea that so-called inflationary theory - the idea that the universe was crated by the Big Bang and has been expanding ever since - is wrong . Instead , he proposes a theory called Conformal Cyclic Cosmology , which requires no beginning to the universe . <p> And the data backs this theory up , he says . <p> " The analysis of Wilkinson Microwave Background Probe 's ( WMAP ) cosmic microwave background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says in a report on the Arvix website . <p> " This is confirmed when the same analysis is applied to BOOMERanG98 data , eliminating the possibility of an instrumental cause for the effects . These observational predictions of CCC would not be easily explained within standard inflationary cosmology . " <p> The circles would have been created by a series of ' shockwaves ' representing events before the last Big Bang . <p> " If you 're not accepting inflation , you 've got to have something else which does what inflation does . In the scheme that I 'm proposing , you have an exponential expansion but it 's not in our aeon - I use the term to describe the period from our Big Bang until the remote future , " Penrose told the BBC . <p> " I claim that this aeon is one of a succession of such things , where the remote future of the previous aeons somehow becomes the Big Bang of our aeon .
