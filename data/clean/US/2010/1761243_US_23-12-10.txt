Meeting Again for the First Time

<h> Meeting Again for the First Time <p> It 's Friday afternoon , and that means clinic . It 's 1 p.m. , and that means I 'm walking to get Samantha from the waiting room for our therapy session . I take a deep breath before I open the door , and find myself looking forward to our session . <p> " Hello , Samantha , " I say , " I 'm Dr. Hufford . Come on back . " <p> I always reserve the same room for our work , hoping that it will help her to remember that we 've met before . Samantha and I have met many times before , but for her , every session is like meeting again for the first time . She is stuck in an unrelenting present , experiencing life about an hour at a time , before her anterograde amnesia -- an inability to remember new events -- sweeps the memories away , floating just out of her reach . <p> " Cognitive difficulties " is the way that her medical record describes it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from before about 15 years ago . She remembers going to college , having friends and ambitions , and falling in love . But her description of the accident is distant and clinical ; a factual recitation of what she has been told happened . In a casual conversation you might not realize that you were talking to someone who would , only hours later , have no recollection of ever meeting you . <p> In clinical terms , her short-term memory is unable to be consolidated into long-term memory . To Samantha , she can sense that her memories are just out of reach , as though if she only tried hard enough they would come flooding back to her . <p> But the flood never comes . <p> Samantha 's clever , self-deprecating sense of humor was endearing right away . She reminded me of what one of my clinical supervisors used to say -- being able to laugh at yourself is the best single indicator of mental health . But her self-deprecating joke from our first session was repeated in our second session , and then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth session , I felt nauseous as she started it again . The joke is a mirthless reminder of what Samantha has lost , and what she continues to lose : With each passing hour , the amnesia continually washes over her , pulling her memories out to sea in an undertow of neurotransmitters run amok . <p> After each of my psychotherapy sessions , I dutifully make an entry into my patient 's medical record , choosing prepackaged dropdown phrases . ' The patient Choose one : Denied , Acknowledged auditory hallucinations , ' ' Mood was Choose one : Euthymic , Elevated , Labile , Constricted , Flat , ' Suicidal ideation was : Choose one : Not present , Present but with no plan , Present with plan ' . Click , click , click , and I try not to think about the fact that my session notes for Samantha are all the same , the exact same . <p> Our hours together are spent oscillating between creating simple printed reminders for her to post in her room reminding her not to dwell on specific worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can please help . There is no place in the session note for her questions -- questions not about the meaning of life , but the meaning of her life , about feeling lonely and wondering who would ever want to be with her . She thinks that she is broken , and wonders what kind of life she can ever have , unanchored from the past . She remarks how well I seem to understand her struggles , unaware that my prescient empathy is an accidental byproduct of her amnesia . <p> Psychotherapy is not my day job . Except for a few hours every Friday afternoon , my working life is spent in drug development , designing and running clinical trials of new medicines for psychiatric problems . That time speeds by , punctuated by meetings , teleconferences , reviews of scientific papers , and summaries of how a new drug compares to placebo in clinical trials of hundreds of patients . It is clean and tidy work . In contrast , the time that I volunteer on Friday afternoons is a chance to wade into the messiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence , and ugliness that is a world away from my office in La Jolla . <p> As the Fridays pass by , one day I hear that the famous neurology patient , H.M. , has died . H.M. 's amnesia was remarkable , and decades of research into his deficits illuminated , among other things , that declarative memory ( knowledge of facts and events ) was separate from procedural memory ( how to do things ) . In short , it is possible to learn something , and yet be unaware that you know it . Upon his death , his brain was sent to San Diego 's Brain Observatory for dissection and digital imaging . One morning , I log on to a website that is streaming live video of the transection of his brain . The automated surgical scraper takes another pass at his frozen brain as the lab technicians update the accompanying blog noting , " The ventricles can now be seen ! " It 's neuroscience as performance art . <p> I close my browser before the next scrape across his brain and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of palm trees . I wonder whether I could live Samantha 's life , dutifully waiting for a medical advance that has yet to come , while not even knowing how long I 've been waiting . I am sure that I could not , drunk as I am on the good fortune of my life . I think of the expectant look on her face in the waiting room every Friday , as she sits there with grace and patience , surrounded by people impatiently waiting for their 10 minutes with a physician and a prescription for what ails them . <p> I have no pills for Samantha , and know that for such complex patients a single clinical trial is unlikely to ever be run -- Samantha 's problems are too complex , and the rarity of patients with such disorders is insufficient for the business of medicine to ever work in her favor . I feel like an agnostic little drummer boy , dutifully drumming my drum while chastising myself for not having more to offer . <p> Am I helping Samantha ? I think that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling is quickly swept away , floating just out of my reach . And then , busy with my work and happy life , another week is gone . It 's Friday afternoon again , and that means clinic . It 's 1 p.m. , and that means I 'm walking to get Samantha from the waiting room for our therapy session . I take a deep breath before I open the door , and find myself looking forward to our session . " Hello Samantha , " I say . " I 'm Dr. Hufford . Come on back . " <p> Last reviewed : By John M.
