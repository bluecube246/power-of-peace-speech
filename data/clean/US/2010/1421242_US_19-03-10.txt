<h> Bryan Singer Wants Lots Of Magneto And Xavier In ' X-Men : First Class ' <p> Director Bryan Singer and producer Lauren Shuler Donner gave a lengthy interview to The Los Angeles Times about the current status of the " X-Men " films , particularly Singer 's " X-Men : First Class . " A lot of hate is being heaped on the fact that Singer wants " First Class " to focus mainly on Professor Xavier and Magneto as opposed to the younger mutants . <p> " Just doing younger mutants is not enough , " said the director . " The story needs to be more than that . I love the relationship between Magneto and Xavier , these two men who have diametrically opposite points of view but still manage to be friends -- to a point . They are the ultimate frenemies . " <p> Honestly , I 'm not that bothered by Singer 's assessment . Xavier is a big part of the " X-Men " story and Magneto is a defining aspect of Xavier . I see this as more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film but not necessarily the central one . Maybe I 'm wrong -- in which case , I would be annoyed -- but I 'm not getting my torch and pitchfork out just yet . <p> In addition to " First Class " talk , the article also mentions that Hugh Jackman is trying to woo Singer into directing a project that 's most likely " Wolverine 2 , " while Donner is attempting to get the filmmaker back for " X-Men 4 . " Sounds like Singer and FOX have made nice nice . Via LA Times <h> Welcome back to Comics Alliance <p> It appears that you already have an account created within our VIP network of sites on .
