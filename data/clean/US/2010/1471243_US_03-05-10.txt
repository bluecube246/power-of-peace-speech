<h> Features <h> Shrinking right : How Youngstown , Ohio , is miles ahead of Detroit <h> Related Tags <p> YOUNGSTOWN , Ohio -- By the summer of 2002 , Youngstown had lost more than 100,000 residents , more than half of its population just a few decades earlier . The city had convened focus groups of community stakeholders to find a way out . Common themes came up in these groups : We 're not the Youngstown we used to be ; we wo n't be that Youngstown ever again ; and we need to shrink to survive . <p> Does that sound familiar , Detroit ? <p> A few months later , a few days before Christmas , leaders planned a citywide meeting , co-convened by Youngstown State University President David Sweet and then Mayor George McKelvey . It was to be the culmination of the focus group work . City hall had no idea how many people would actually show up . They thought a few hundred people would be a success . <p> Youngstown aggressively promoted the event , which would take place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood that was once known for its steel barons but was becoming known for its vacancies . <p> The city took out ads calling everyone to the meeting --- the cynics , the pessimists , the optimists -- and used frank language , booking this as the last , best chance to save Youngstown from irrelevance . The ads reminded people that others called Youngstown " miserable " and " dying , " words with which we Detroiters are quite familiar . <p> And even though it was freezing that night , the people came . They piled in , one after another , after another . In the end , 1,400 people showed up , curious to hear what could be done to change their city . <p> Why Youngstown and Detroit <p> Youngstown is smaller . Four Youngstowns could fit inside one Detroit . Its population would have to be multiplied by 12 to match the Motor City 's . What lessons could Youngstown possibly offer us ? It turns out , there is a lot to glean from the city 's experiences . <p> " What is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the Great Lakes region everywhere , " says Hunter Morrison , director of the Center for Urban and Regional Studies at Youngstown State . " Detroit is not alone , and it 's not failure . ... Detroit is so much like Youngstown . " <p> Both cities face very real and very similar problems . A single industry powered each city 's rise , and each has seen that industry decline dramatically . Both have seen their populations shrink while vacancies increase . Both are dealing with tough revenue , crime and school issues . Yet , at the same time , both have deeply passionate people working to improve their cities at all costs . <p> The cities ' story lines start out similarly . " You can take ' Youngstown ' out and plug in ' Detroit , ' " says Youngstown Mayor Jay Williams . " You can take out ' steel ' and plug in ' cars . ' " <p> What comes next is different . While , for the most part , Detroit has sat idling , Youngstown has put a finger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started dealing with them . <p> Detroit has no right-sizing plan . In Mayor Dave Bing 's State of the City address in March , he acknowledged this , saying : " We have lacked a true vision and viable plan in Detroit for decades . " He 's talked about a plan , but revealed nothing aside from demolition . <p> With its Youngstown 2010 plan and strong vision from city leadership , this small Ohio city , on the other hand , has had a big head start , and it 's starting to work . <p> It happened one night <p> At the time of that 2002 December meeting , Williams was the director of Youngstown 's community development agency . " The spark was lit that night , " he says . " It was December , it was cold , it was close to Christmas . The meeting was supposed to be an hour and a half long . We were there for three hours . We listened to ( the audience ) . They vented . <p> " If I had to pick the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that building , it was that night , " the mayor says . <p> The audience was n't shy . Most were sick of the vacancies , of the decline , tired of waiting for Youngstown to change , to do something . Years before , they had been told there could be a defense contractor coming in to save the city , then there was talk of a new factory , and some were still waiting for the steel mills to open back up . <p> " We were a community in waiting , " says Bill D'Avignon , director of city planning for Youngstown . " We were waiting for that knight in shining armor , waiting for a blimp factory to come and save us . " <p> The vision unveiled at the meeting went to city council and passed 7-0 . This would become the impetus for Youngstown 2010 , a citywide , community-engaged plan for Youngstown 's future -- a future with roughly 70,000 people ( or less ) , not the 170,000 who lived there at the height of its boom , nor the 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The bones of the plan are cemented on four tenets : accept that Youngstown is a smaller city ; define Youngstown 's role in the new regional economy ; improve Youngstown 's image and enhance quality of life ; and a put out a call to action . <p> The tenets are n't exactly mind blowing . Youngstown has n't loaded the chamber with silver bullets , but at least they 've had clear targets . Youngstowners also approved , by 74 percent , a city charter amendment that says the city has to revisit and reassess the plan every 10 years , after the Census . Youngstown 2010 is a roadmap . <p> Here darlin ' in Youngstown <p> Youngstown had a plan in the 1950s . Sitting atop the powerful steel industry , Youngstown expected to hit 250,000 people , and the city built out infrastructure to accommodate that number . The plan was revised in 1974 , three years before Youngstown Sheet and Tube -- one of the largest steel mills in the world -- closed , furloughing 5,000 jobs in a weekend . Locals call that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next four years , would see more and more steel plants close and 40,000 manufacturing jobs disappear . <p> The last Census had Youngstown 's population at 82,000 . This year 's Census will have that number even lower . " I tend to think ( the population of Youngstown ) will be close to 65,000 , " says Tom Finnerty Jr. , associate director for YSU 's Center for Urban and Regional studies and lead writer for the Youngstown 2010 plan . " We 'll be hard pressed to hit 70,000 that 's for sure . " <p> About 43 percent of Youngstown 's land is vacant ; and , as of January of last year , Youngstown had 4,500 vacant structures throughout the city . <p> " Shrinking is un-American in a way , " Morrison says . Urban areas , by nature , are about growing either up or out . Size and population define cities . <p> But does bigger define quality of life ? The Youngstowners said no . " Acceptance was the most significant part of that plan , " Morrison says . " Accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Smaller does n't mean giving up . And ( Youngstown ) started to see that , " Williams says . " This is a community with a great heart that has been defined by failure because of its one industry . The industry that made us great no longer existed in the way it did . But we did n't have to be ashamed of that . We were the butt of jokes and we were sick of it . " <p> And no one was waiting in the wings to save them . <p> " D.C. is n't going to come in and help us , " he continues . " Maybe they 'll play a role but that was n't going to happen . There was n't going to be a blimp factory or some defense firm coming in . It was just us and we were doing something about it . " <p> Community engagement <p> The Youngstown 2010 plan came together in January 2005 , a little more than two years after the vision was unveiled . An audience of 1,300 was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this was spent educating and reinforcing the community with the tenants of the vision and enforcing the importance of having a solid plan . <p> Youngstown 's 31 neighborhoods were grouped into 11 clusters , and meetings were held in each cluster . Attendance was high . Everything was transparent , and it was all on the table . <p> " Collaboration was key to this entire process , " says Williams . It was important that this was n't just a city plan . It needed to be a plan brought on by the people , enforced by the people , with city facilitation . And , that 's exactly what they got . " From the city leaders to Youngstown State to the community , it was a 180-degree turn , " Williams adds . " This was n't going to be another run of the mill city plan . This was going to engage . " <p> " The planning process was very important part of how we did it , " says Morrison . " There was a lot of suspicion of politics . Involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil Kidd agreed . " They allowed honest discourse , to talk about the obvious problems in every neighborhood . " Kidd had started a " Defend Youngstown " campaign to , well , you get the picture . <p> A plan and a lot of land <p> But where does the heart of Youngstown 2010 lie ? A plan that rethinks a city , let alone shrinks one , is complex , multi-faceted and damn hard to pin down . <p> Beyond trying to diversify its economy , it is about Youngstown 's land , namely what to do with the oversized infrastructure , 4,500 vacant structures , and 43 percent vacant land . Ring any bells , Detroit ? <p> In Williams ' first term , he demoed more abandoned houses than the previous four years combined . Youngstown , on average , had been allotting $300,000 toward demos , dropping 150 houses a year . Between 2006 and 2010 , Williams has averaged a $1 million demo budget , bringing down 370 abandoned , unsafe structures . <p> In addition , the administration also made a point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was strategic . And removing that blight built confidence in the neighborhood , " Williams says . <p> Fresh dirt <p> Freshly demoed lots are visible throughout the neighborhoods of Youngstown . But that 's not the goal . An empty lot is better than blight , but something constructive is better than an empty lot . For example , major blight is hard to come by along Market Street , heading toward downtown . Manicured lots with flowers , trees and rocks dot this main artery where there was once blight and abandonment . <p> The urban agriculture movement is growing there , too . Grow Youngstown not only advocates for urban agriculture , it also distributes fresh , local produce to underserved neighborhoods in the city . In a neighborhood in the south end of Youngstown called Idora , an urban 4H club was started . The neighborhood association , in partnership with the Youngstown Neighborhood Development Corp . ( YNDC ) , is working toward creating a block-long urban garden that once was covered with blight ( among other things ) . <p> Additionally , YSU has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east side into a wetlands mitigation bank . Parts of the east side look as if roads were laid over a forest and someone forgot to build the houses . <p> Youngstown still has a lot of neighborhood blight to tackle . The city 's targeted demo list has 1,100 structures on it , but has funds to knock down 250 . " If we had $8 million we could bring them all down right now , " says D'Avignon . " But we do n't . " Let 's get it started <p> Youngstown is n't done ; but at least they 've started , and they have a clear vision . What 's clear here , however , is that Detroit has a lot of catching up to do , and the current administration has yet to move much beyond talk . <p> Mayor Dave Bing 's land-use plan has yet to come to light . We know he plans to demo 3,000 structures off the bat and a total of 10,000 structures by 2014 . Everything else has been hush-hush . We know the city , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in famed urban planner Toni Griffin from Newark , NJ , to help the city either create or facilitate the plan . And we know , through Data Driven Detroit ( which did not respond to multiple queries ) , the info is out there that will help with the planning . But the city still has n't unveiled a document , any language , or honest-to-goodness direction . <p> Williams , though , says Bing 's acknowledgment is a start . <p> " The fact that he is the mayor , and talking about it , and it 's getting so much attention , should show you the importance of it , " Williams says . " We can still get our arms around Youngstown . Detroit is just so big ... he 'll have to break up the city into manageable projects with achievable goals . " <p> And that 's OK , because bigger does n't always mean better . " Detroit is going to be OK as a smaller Detroit , " says the mayor of Youngstown . And he should know . <p> What 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Terry Parris Jr . ' s coverage here .
