aurora health care plans to build a network of pediatric specialists throughout eastern wisconsin , which could put the state 's largest health system in competition with children 's hospital of wisconsin. ( 69 )  milwaukee county  jim stingl in my opinion  running in the footsteps of a hero  milwaukee firefighters ( from left ) lt. tina conklin , firefighter tracy buckland , firefighter sandy williamson , capt . ellen spatt , and firefighter-paramedic kristin ticcioni will be joined by four others from the area for the 5k tunnel to towers run in new york . the run commemorates stephen siller , a firefighter killed on sept. 11 , 2001 .  periodically , columnist jim stingl hits the streets of milwaukee . to see his latest video columns , click the thumbnails below .  loading ...  with the benefit of hindsight , it 's not a fair question to ask if other firefighters would do what stephen siller did that awful day .  we know it cost him his life , along with 342 other new york firefighters and 2001 .  siller was off duty and on his way to play golf , but when he heard about planes hitting the towers he drove from brooklyn toward manhattan . when he found the brooklyn-battery tunnel shut down , he abandoned his vehicle and ran the rest of the way in his fire gear . no trace of his body was ever found . he had a wife and five children at home .  later this month , nine milwaukee firefighters and paramedics - all women - will retrace his steps in the 5k tunnel to towers run in new york , held annually in siller 's honor . they will put themselves in his shoes that day . or boots , actually . in fact , the women will run 3.1 miles in full firefighting gear - the heavy coat , pants , boots , gloves and even helmet .  " we just thought it was a wonderful way to help support the firefighters and families in new york city and show that we do truly never forget , " said ellen spatt , a captain on organize the difficult quest by a visit last year from tim brown , a firefighter who survived the sept. 11 attack and has since retired from the nyfd . he was missing the run to be here for the retirement party of a milwaukee firefighter , so he challenged everyone to join the 2010 run .  spatt narrowed in on her female colleagues for a team . they were excited about the idea .  " then i said we 're going to run it with one thing - we 're going to do it in firefighting gear . and they 're like , ' ohhh , ok . ' but not one of them backed down , " she said .  the women , ranging in age from 25 to 48 , have been practicing every week on the track at hart park in wauwatosa . they 've gotten a lot of strange looks and questions from the t-shirt-and-shorts crowd out there . firefighter tracy buckland drew particular interest from a school cross country coach .  the women do n't run fast . the rubbing of their hear the clanking of their spanner belts , which are used to carry axes and other tools . you see them running , and you 're tempted to yell , " hey , where 's the fire ? "  their goal on sept. 26 , the day of the run , is to finish without stopping to walk . they want to feel what stephen siller felt as he rushed through the streets .  " there 's a lot of chafing . you get hot and sweaty . your feet hurt running in the boots . it 's not a tennis shoe , " spatt said . " we are in our gear all the time at fire scenes , and we 're running around doing things for short times and bursts of energy . but to run a 5k in your gear is a challenge . "  they estimate the extra weight of the gear is about 30 pounds . it 's made to keep heat away from their skin , so it 's certainly not intended to ventilate a runner .  some of them are tina conklin said she 's not much of a runner in real life . " my hope is to keep up with these people and not look stupid , " she laughed . " do you know how hot it is in manhattan in september ?  they will be joined in new york by some male firefighters from milwaukee , but those guys do n't plan to run in their turnout gear . they 'll also run alongside other firefighters and police officers from around the country . the run is open to anyone .  spatt and the others share a sense of pride in what they do for a living . they understand the call to duty that siller felt that day .  " that 's the wonderful thing about the spirit of these solid women firefighters that we have . they always aspire to do more , " spatt said .  the other six women joining them are sandy williamson , kristin ticcioni , jennifer schaefer , sue lucas , kristin ciganek and julie hall .  stingl on the radio  jim stingl talks ( 620 ) .
