She plans to take a class at STCC next semester and then go to Boston University , which offers a nutrition major at its Sargent College . <p> Like other sensitive residents of South Hadley , Kay is conscious of the shadow cast by the suicide last year of Phoebe Prince , who had been bullied . As a model for other youngsters , she wants to make an anti-bullying message part of her agenda . <p> Although her attitude is unrelentingly positive , she wants kids her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tight-knit community and having something go terribly wrong .
