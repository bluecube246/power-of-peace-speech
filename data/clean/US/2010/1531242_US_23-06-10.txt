the yellowing of basil leaves is an indicator of basil blight . dr. margaret mcgrath hide caption  toggle caption dr. margaret mcgrath  the yellowing of basil leaves is an indicator of basil blight .  dr. margaret mcgrath  there 's bad news for gardeners who grow basil to sprinkle over italian food or thai dishes -- or anyone who thinks pesto is the best flavor on earth .  a potentially fatal fungal disease called downy mildew has been attacking basil plants in new york , new jersey , ohio and florida . gardeners are worried that it could spread farther throughout the summer , turning delicate green basil leaves an ugly shade of brown , yellow or gray .  web resources  and it spreads fast , says margaret mcgrath , an associate professor of plant pathology at cornell university . " it wipes the leaves right out -- and that 's what you want to use , " mcgrath tells npr 's michele norris . " and it can go pretty darn fast . and it 's new so people do is similar to late blight in tomatoes or downy mildew in cucumbers , squash and melons . mcgrath says these are considered " community diseases " because they move easily .  it wipes the leaves right out -- and that 's what you want to use . and it can go pretty darn fast . and it 's new so people do n't know about it .  " if you have it in your garden , you can affect other gardeners and farmers because the pathogen can jump onto their crops and plants , " she says .  mcgrath says basil blight was reported in uganda in 1933 and was n't reported again until 2001 in switzerland .  the sign of the blight , mcgrath says , is the top of the leaf will start yellowing . but to really know the state of the plant , you have to flip the leaves over and look on the undersides .  " you 'll see a grayish , almost purplish dusty growth on the underside , sometimes turning to almost black -- and that is all of them on the underside of the leaves , " she says . " the wind will pick those up and blow them off and the disease just keeps multiplying like crazy . "  mcgrath says that if you see the blight , you could get rid of the leaves , but if you remove one , you 'll probably knock around the spores and they could get on other parts of the plant . she suggests making pesto on the spot with the healthy leaves when you see the first signs of blight .  to really know the state of the basil plant , you have to flip the leaves over and look on the undersides -- and see if there is a dusty grayish , purplish or blackish growth ( pictured ) . dr. margaret mcgrath hide caption  toggle caption dr. margaret mcgrath  to really know the state of the basil plant , you have to flip the leaves over and look on the undersides -- and see if there is a dusty grayish , purplish or blackish growth ( pictured ) .  dr. margaret last year , when i first saw it , which was the beginning of august , i looked at my husband and i said , ' we 're not waiting till september when we normally made pesto . get the machine out , we 're making pesto now . ' and we just harvested everything out of the garden and made pesto . "  her method of storing it is to make pesto balls , put them in sandwich bags and freeze them .  but , of course , mcgrath says : " it 's not the same as the fresh leaves . "
