" Also Central Asia -- areas in transition or areas which are struggling with the basics of hammering down the rule of law . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these kinds of bad consequences . Even on the receiving side -- even amongst the developing countries which consume the bulk of the drugs -- the areas where these drugs are targeted are often neglected areas , areas where the rule of law is weak in the receiving countries . Those are the areas that need to be brought back into the mainstream . " <p> There Goes The Neighborhood <p> Leggett says being a country along the major transit routes for Afghan opium and heroin does not , in itself , imply higher drug-consumption levels . <p> " Drug problems are quite often local problems , but they are connected internationally . So the entire chain needs to be considered from the producer to the consumer , " Leggett says . " But also , we need to look at each link in that chain . The ' World Drug Report ' points out that despite having some 80 tons of heroin trafficked through it year after year , the Balkan region has not shown particularly high levels of drug use and not particularly high levels of drug violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an area like Central Asia , you will see that there are high levels of localized drug use along the drug trafficking routes . " <p> " World Drug Report 2010 " says a large volume of opium is consumed by people in Iran -- about 40 percent of all global opium consumption . <p> But in contrast to its high opium consumption levels , and despite its proximity to the world 's largest heroin producer , the UNODC says official reports indicate that heroin consumption is relatively low in Iran -- which has an estimated 391,000 heroin users . <p> It says Pakistan has an estimated 500,000 heroin users . Meanwhile , in Afghanistan , the number of heroin users is reported to have risen from about 50,000 in 2008 to as many as 135,000 in 2009 . <p> China has the largest number of heroin users in absolute terms -- about 2.2 million . Most of the supply in China is thought to come from Myanmar rather than Afghanistan , but traffickers of Afghan heroin are thought to be gaining shares of the illicit market in China during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary amount of opium a century ago , opium use in China now appears to be much more limited . <p> Eurasian Habit <p> Taken together , it is Europe and Russia that now account for nearly half of all heroin consumption in the world . <p> Four countries within Europe dominate that market -- the United Kingdom , France , Italy , and Germany . But the UNODC says Afghanistan is now the only known source of heroin that is consumed in Europe and in the Russian Federation . <p> Leggett explains that the opiate market is interlinked with severe national and international security problems -- especially in Afghanistan and Pakistan . <p> " Drug production tends to occur in areas where there is a large amount of social instability -- often times , insurgency . If you look , for example , at the country that produces most of the world 's heroin , it is Afghanistan . It is not a coincidence that that is true , " Leggett says . " The leading producer of processed cocaine is Colombia . Both of these countries have got serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are large areas of uncontrolled land or disputed territory , it allows drugs production to occur in those areas . " <p> UNODC director Antonio Maria Costa has called for universal access to drug treatment as a strategy to combat the world drugs trade , saying that the problem will not be solved by shifting consumption from developed countries to the developing world . <p> Costa says that while users in more prosperous countries have the necessary facilities to help them overcome drug addiction , this was not the case for poorer nations . <p> Costa concludes that drug addiction should be handled as a health issue , rather than a law enforcement issue in which users are punished with prison sentences or even execution .
