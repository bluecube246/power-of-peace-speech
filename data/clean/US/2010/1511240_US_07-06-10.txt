<h> Allen : Oil spill now ' hundreds or thousands ' of patches <p> Adm . Thad Allen says the 1 million gallons of dispersant used to break up the oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico has helped create " hundreds or thousands of patches " of oil that need to be cleaned up . <p> Update : The Oval has updated this post to correct Allen 's quote about the number of patches . We regret the error . <p> The spill is " no longer a single spill but a massive collection of smaller spills , " said Allen , who briefed reporters at the White House before heading into an 11 a.m . ET meeting with President Obama and Cabinet officials working on the spill response . <p> The upside is that mass quantities of oil do n't wash up in any one place along the shore , according to Allen , the federal incident commander for the spill . But finding and removing so many patches is " increasing vastly the complexity of the response , " he said . <p> To find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operators of 1,500 fishing boats . More Coast Guard cutters and patrol boats also are being brought in , Allen said . <p> Meanwhile , British Petroleum is making progress capturing oil from the ruptured Deepwater Horizon well . More than 420,000 gallons a day are now being captured and BP is moving another vessel in to process more oil , Allen said . " I think it 's going fairly well , " he said of the latest effort to halt the flow . <p> In other news , Allen said : <p> It will take four to six weeks after the leak is stopped in early August to clean up oil slicks on the surface of the water . Cleaning up marshlands and restoring ecosystems will take years , he said . <p> He plans to meet with BP officials to discuss speeding up their claims process for individuals and business owners affected by the spill . " We 'd like them to do it a little faster , " he said . <p> At least 120 linear miles of shoreline have been affected by the spill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brent Jones .
