all things animal in southern california and beyond  endangered wild foxes of santa catalina island are rebounding  march 2 , 2010 2:44 pm  a decade after a canine distemper outbreak killed nearly its entire population , the endangered catalina island fox is making a comeback . about 1,200 of the 1,300 foxes on santa catalina island , off the coast of southern california , died as a result of the outbreak . now , thanks to a program to save the species and several years ' worth of fortuitous weather patterns , their numbers have rebounded . our colleague louis sahagun has the details in a story tuesday ; here 's an excerpt :  standing beside a sign posted along a main road urging people to watch for foxes , carlos de la rosa , the catalina island conservancy 's chief conservation and education officer , said , " soon we 'll have more than 1,300 foxes . but reaching that number is not , in and of itself , as great an achievement as bringing them back from the brink of extinction itself . "  the population had crashed to about 100 in 1999 , when the conservancy and the institute for wildlife studies launched a $2-million recovery program that includes vaccinations , aerial monitoring and education programs .  a captive breeding program here ended in 2004 , the same year the u.s. fish and wildlife service listed the cat-sized subspecies as endangered . about 950 catalina island foxes call the island home , up from 784 at this time last year , according to a recent islandwide trapping effort by conservancy wildlife biologists julie king and calvin duncan .  the foxes are trapped once a year and inspected for illnesses , including an unusual , potentially fatal ear cancer that recently began showing up in older foxes .  the animal 's remarkable recovery was spurred , in part , by several years of fluctuations in the weather . an extreme drought in 2007 resulted in the deaths of significant numbers of mule deer , whose carcasses were scavenged by the omnivorous 5-pound foxes . by the time breeding season arrived in 2008 , many foxes were literally obese were having larger-than-normal litters .  good rains the past two years triggered an abundance of fruit-bearing cactuses and a population explosion of mice , convenient prey for female foxes to feed to their pups.
