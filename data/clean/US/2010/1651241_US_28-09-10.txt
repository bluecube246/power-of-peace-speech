The challenge in Cuba 's free-market reforms  HAVANA , Cuba -- A major shakeup is coming to this communist-run island over the next six months , as the Cuban government plans to slash state payrolls by 500,000 workers and offset the cuts with new opportunities for self-employment and limited private enterprise .  The challenge will be ideological as well as practical , since the Cuban government does n't need to create a new economic system so much as accept the one that already exists , but which now operates largely in the shadows .  The communist party newspaper Granma published an index Friday of the 178 occupations that some 250,000 additional Cubans will be licensed to perform under the new self-employment guidelines . But it was a list of jobs that many Cubans already do illegally , as black marketeers , risking fines and possibly worse , while paying no taxes and leaving no paper trail .  Will the island 's unlicensed nannies , gardeners and dog trainers be willing to pay taxes and truthfully report their income ? Will the government allow death ?  The questions suggest Cuba 's changes will require a mental readjustment for would-be entrepreneurs and government officials alike .  For decades the Castro government has treated market economics as a morally corrosive force , erecting billboards that declare " Socialism or Death , " while deploying legions of police to make sure Cubans do n't illegally repair televisions or sell unauthorized pastries . When the government eased restrictions on self-employment in the early 1990s , it clamped down again when the economy improved and drove thousands out of business or back to black market labor .  This time around , the government is signaling that the measures are here to stay .  " The decision to allow for more self-employment is one that the country has made in order to redesign its economic policy with the goal of increasing productivity and efficiency , " read Friday 's Granma article about self-employment , titled " Much more than an Alternative . "  It continued : " It 's also a way to offer workers another way to feel their own efforts are useful , and of extinction and stigmatized those licensed to practice it in the 1990s . "  To overcome the distrust of Cubans who have learned to practice industriousness in secret , it may take more than such assurances . Many here have survived for decades by subtle modes of deception , pilfering from their workplaces , selling their labor illegally or cheating their bosses in one form or another .  Now the government will ask them to comply with a new tax system and honestly report their earnings and expenses .  But no one knows how the tax system can succeed if the country does n't have a standardized income-reporting system , let alone the paper to print one on .  It 's also not clear how the government will cope with the enforcement burden of regulating the new private sector . The list published Friday even specifies the characters Cubans can depict as street performers .  But the logistics might not be as important as the ideology .  For more than a year , the Raul Castro government has been laying the groundwork for these changes the country 's economic problems in both neighborhood meetings and state-run media such as Granma .  The result is a re-casting of Cuban socialism as a system that increasingly accepts a role for the private sector and links productivity to worker income . Cubans will also now be able to hire workers who are n't family members , something already widely practiced on the black market , but ideologically taboo until now .  More importantly , perhaps , the changes will require Cuban government officials to accept that it is a waste of time and resources to try to stop people from making and doing things to earn a living -- especially when they become prosperous . Existing inequalities will inevitably widen with the measures , so the Cuban government will have to begin directing assistance at the neediest , another departure from the island 's experiment with egalitarianism .  " Those who contribute more will receive more -- that is the principle of our new tax system , which will help raise revenue for the state , and achieve an adequate redistribution of resources for society , National Bank is studying proposals to provide micro-credits to aspiring entrepreneurs , but analysts expect much of the capital for small businesses will come from Cubans living abroad . The island receives an estimated $1.2 billion a year in cash send home from Cuban expatriates .  Decrepit small and medium-sized state-run businesses could be converted all over the island . At a rundown snack stand in one of Havana 's western neighborhoods , 52-year-old Raul Duran makes one kind of sandwich -- ham on white bread -- in his state job . He said he had n't studied the measures but welcomed the change to start a business or convert the operation into a worker-run cooperative .
