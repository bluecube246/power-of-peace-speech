chicago , ill . ( cbs ) amanda knox , convicted of murder in italy last year , has been photographed countless times and her image featured in news stories across the world .  yet , there is an alarming photo of the american student few have seen . the framed photograph is n't troubling for what it shows . it 's shocking because of where , and when , it was ultimately displayed .  a wire service photographer took the original shot on november 3 , 2007 in perugia , italy . that was a day after british student meredith kercher was found murdered in the bedroom of a house she shared with knox .  the photo shows knox , dressed in a navy blue v-neck sweater , talking with a group of law enforcement agents in the driveway of the crime scene house . the young american is gesturing with both hands , but the photo is n't a compelling action shot . it is a simple image of police listening to a potential witness .  nonetheless , this amanda knox , neatly laid out on white matting paper , and put in an attractive wooden frame . amazingly , it was then hung on a wall in the headquarters of the italian forensic police in what can only be called a hall of shame - a photo gallery of many of italy 's most notorious criminals who the police had brought to justice .  that was long before knox was actually charged with murder .  " i could not believe my eyes when i saw the picture , " says cbs consultant and chicago private investigator paul ciolino . " there 's a photo of amanda knox , an honor student from seattle , hanging along side of photos of italy 's most vicious killers , kidnappers and mafia kingpins . it was unbelievable . i mean , the girl had n't even been charged with a crime at the time , yet she 'd become one of the big trophy criminals they 'd bagged . "  ciolino saw the photo display for himself when he was at the rome forensic police headquarters in february 2008 .  the american system of justice protects -- a person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law .  " if that is the case , " asks ciolino , " then why is amanda 's picture up on the wall ? looks like she 's been singled out as guilty from the start . especially when you consider there were no trophy photos of her co-defendants , rudy guede or raffaele sollecito , hanging in the hall of shame . it 's just her . "  the roman forensic police literally nailed knox to a wall just three months after she was arrested and eight months before she was formally charged with any crime .  to ciolino , it 's a case where one picture really is worth a thousand words . he notes , " this is the forensic police after all ; the scientific cops . their main job is to be objective . ask yourself , were they ? amanda 's hall of shame photo screams bias against this young american girl . she never stood a chance . "  doug longhini has been covering the amanda knox case since november 2007.
