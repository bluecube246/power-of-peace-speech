Lack of paid apps in Android Market contributes to app piracy ...

google recently announced a new licensing system to combat app piracy . developers are pleased to see stronger protection of their creation , but if google really wants to fight theft , it should expand paid app support to more countries .  global android users have been banging this drum , but the noise has fallen on deaf ears . after nearly two years of existence , the android market still supports paid apps in only 14 countries . anyone not in one of those 14 nations is forced to sit on the sideline and wait for a day that is n't promised this calendar year or the next .  or they can do the unthinkable and steal .  make no mistake about it : hordes of people using illegal copies of android apps would still do so if they could purchase apps . however , i 'd wager that there 's a large portion of consumers who would gladly pay for the privilege . the lack of support forces many to travel down the shady path .  take a look at this buka and radiant . the retro shooter game radiant has about 50,000 users , but thousands of those users run illegal copies of the app .  you 'll notice that places with the highest piracy rates are in regions where only a handful of nations have turned on the paid app switch . hexage reports that  70 percent of radiant players in europe , where only 8 of 49 nations have paid app support , use a pirated copy .  asia , which has a whopping 97 percent , has only japan and south korea among its rank of paid users .  south america , which does n't have any nation eligible for paid apps , also has a 97 percentage rate of illegal copies .  north america ( canada and the u.s. ) comparatively reports 43 percent illegal users . that 's considerably lower than other regions , and i strongly believe that the u.s. getting paid apps early contributed to that lower rating . would oceania 's 91 percent be lower had paid apps arrived in australia and new zealand sooner ?  moralists markets for buying apps , but those solutions are less attractive and publicized than the built-in market . the reality is that not every desirable app is in these markets , and constantly sideloading updates to apps is a headache for developers and consumers .  adding paid support to more countries will not spell the end of app piracy . however , it could stem the tide of people turning to black markets out of frustration and necessity . google continues to say that there are several external factors that prevent it from adding paid apps to more countries , but those obstacles need to be addressed . licensing may set up roadblocks for now , but history has shown that dedicated people will eventually find their way around software limitation . it 's best to make the need to pirate apps a non-issue .  hexage informed us that the anonymous usage data has been collected over a period of 10 months using flurry analytics and google checkout api . piracy rate represents the ratio of unlicensed copies to the total number of installed copies . for example , users obtained the app illegally .  yes this actical is correct . i live in denmark one of the countries who do not have paidable apps . i do not want to root my mobil , to scare to brink it . i have found around this that is not illegal . i have bought prepaid at&amp;t simcard from the usa , with no money on it . i paid like 5 dollers for it on ebay and got it sent to my door , took 4 days . then i switch out my danish simcard with the at&amp;t card . then my phone , even when im in denmark , thinks it is american phone , all paid apps are available . then i pay with my google check account and volia i have the apps i want . then when i put my own simcard in agian , all my paid apps still get updated thru the market without changin simcard .. some might see this as abit to much to go thru , but it is really not that bad , and i really want to support pay apps .  the people in those affected countries use market enabler . i would like to think most people would do the right thing , rather than pirating paid apps . market enabler is easily found in a google search if you are looking to unlock your market to paid apps ...  great post , andrew . one of the most common objections i heard to my paidapppledge post was from folks who , because of the country they live in , are unable to buy paid apps in the android market . there was a time i 'd have argued that flaws in the official market are just opportunities for 3rd party markets , none have really risen to the occasion , and at this point , google just needs to start fixing things . the exciting hardware and huge numbers of people buying android phones should drive huge interest from developers , but issues like these have the potential to really damp that interest .  interesting idea . however , i reckon that someone who is savvy enough to pirate an app would pirate the fathom how cheap some people are that they would actively pirate apps that cost $1-$2 a piece . that 's like shoplifting at the dollar store ! i swear , some people will steal anything that is n't bolted down ...  that 's the puch line : if one needs a $2 app , but has no easy way to pay the $2 -- she has a huge incentive to steal . when i can not use my cellular to pay for the parking place , i will usually park without paying , because i rarely have the coins that the machine will accept . apple has the built-in payment channel always open , which makes it much easier to buy .  i was mainly referring to the rampant piracy in the us , where we do have access ( but i did n't say that ) . so , i agree to a certain extent -- i can see why people do it if there is no other avenue . except there are 2 other perfectly legal options : us sims and other stores . you can sidestep load apps over wifi , as has already been mentioned ( but i suspect that many do n't know this ) . while i understand that it is a major pita , and google should get their a$$ in gear and get the marketplace running across the globe , i can not accept the argument that people are forced into pirating . sure , there will be people that will pirate regardless , but there is a perfectly legal avenue to pursue , and it is n't that expensive . the marketplace should be available all over the world . however , apple 's app store is not entirely global , although it supports many more countries , and they keep adding new countries . it does illustrate that the problem with google checkout ( which is where the problem lies ) is more fundamental -- i suspect it has something to do with local laws , regulations and consumer rights . on a side note ... seriously ? even though you know there is a chance that you wo n't be able to park legally without coins if you ca ? you always have the option to going around the corner and parking somewhere your phone can be used to make payments -- nobody forces you to park there illegally . or you could *shock* keep the proper coins the car *shock* . similarly , google is n't forcing you to pirate . there are stores other than the market place which do n't have such stringent restrictions on location . see slideme , handango , mobihand , pocketgear/androidgear , to name but a few .  &gt;&gt;on a side note ... seriously ? even though you know there is a chance that you wo n't be able to park legally without coins if you ca n't pay with your phone , you do it anyway ? you always have the option to going around the corner and parking somewhere your phone can be used to make payments -- nobody forces you to park there illegally . or you could *shock* keep the proper coins the car *shock* . similarly , google is n't forcing you to pirate . there are stores other than the market place which do n't have , mobihand , pocketgear/androidgear , to name but a few . &gt;&gt; haha , i 'm guessing you do n't regularly park at meters . keep coins in your car . you really expect me to believe that on the day you are running late , w/o time to search for a parking space and no coins in your car , you just give up an go home rather than park w/o paying . whenever people make statements like this that ignore reality , it makes me suspicious of anything else they say .  you would be correct -- i do n't part at parking meters much at all . however , i will guarantee that i have enough coins in my car for parking at any time . i have a little compartment in the dash that has nothing but coins in it . see , i rarely use cash for anything ( and coins almost never get used ) , so those coins just sit there . i wo n't say that i would never park illegally -- it would depend on the circumstance . but generally , paying because , at least where i live , you are almost guaranteed to get a ticket within 30 minutes of parking there illegally . i do n't care if you believe me or not . you are free to dismiss anything i say with the belief that i am out of touch with reality , but that would be incredible short-sighted . perhaps you should be a little more organized . maybe you should leave a little earlier so you can park a couple of blocks further away where you can pay with your phone , or maybe , you know , make sure you have coins in the car ... it 's not that difficult . or just deal with the parking tickets . you might benefit from this app : http : **44;66;toolong ...  like microsoft does n't take initiative to provide windows easily available in stores and at a affordable price , android is also following the same path but things have improved with microsoft and their marketing strategies over the past 2-4 years . lets see where android lands in terms of paid apps and online -- coming soon for pre-orders
