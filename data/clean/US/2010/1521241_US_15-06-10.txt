ST . LOUIS ? On a cool weekday afternoon , a small group of young adults gathers outside Covenant House , a homeless shelter where some of them live or go to school . Armed with clipboards , they jump into a van and head out to search for their target : uninsured children .  For the next three hours , the group of 20-somethings , called " door knockers , " canvass a lower-income neighborhood looking for children who are eligible for two government programs : Medicaid and the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) . " We 're in the neighborhood to sign up kids for free health care , " says Maurice Raspberry , 21 , who lives at the shelter .  Tami Wright , also 21 , answers the door at her grandmother 's house . Her children , ages 1 and 3 , are uninsured because she did n't know how to renew their coverage through Medicaid , the state-federal health program for the poor . " I do n't work and I do n't have a car , who is uninsured .  One of the canvassers shows her how to fill out an application . " I like the feeling of knowing we are trying to help kids , " says Cierra Ball , 20 , a high-school dropout who is earning her GED at Covenant House and is also uninsured .  The door knockers , who are paid $10 an hour , are part of a nationwide drive to sign up the 5 million children who qualify for the Medicaid and CHIP programs but are n't enrolled . Children without insurance are 10 times more likely than insured children to go without needed care , a study by the Urban Institute found . The Obama administration wants all eligible children signed up by 2015 . So far , the federal government has handed out $40 million in grants for enrollment initiatives , and $80 million more is on the way .  The effort also serves as a dress rehearsal for a major enrollment campaign likely to occur when the health care law takes full effect . The law aims to extend coverage to 32 people to have insurance . It offers new coverage options , including a sharply expanded Medicaid program .  Yet many health experts say it will take a major campaign by government , health facilities and non-profit groups to get people signed up . Cindy Mann , the top Medicaid official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , says the efforts to find and enroll uninsured children now will help show what works best -- from low-tech labors such as knocking on doors to more sophisticated approaches using government databases or social media to find uninsured kids .  " There will always be communities , individuals and families who for one reason or another need some guiding through the enrollment process , " Mann says .  Slow start for expansion  Research suggests many reasons why so many children remain uninsured : Sometimes parents are n't aware their kids are eligible , or do n't know how to enroll or re-enroll their children . Some states have been reluctant to spend extra money to cover more children and have cumbersome application processes .  President Obama to a slow start because budget-strapped states do n't have the money to broaden eligibility , according to several studies , including from the National Academy for State Health Policy .  Louisiana has emerged as one of the most aggressive states in finding and enrolling uninsured children . The state has used various strategies , including greatly simplifying the application process , to reduce the rate of uninsured children to 5% in 2009 from 11% in 2003 -- nearly 85,000 fewer uninsured kids .  In February , the state identified 10,000 uninsured children by searching food-stamp rolls . Parents did n't have to make a single phone call or sign a form .  Still , Louisiana faces a big challenge in signing up more than 550,000 eligible poor adults for Medicaid once the health law expands coverage in 2014 , says Ruth Kennedy , deputy director of Louisiana 's Medicaid agency and head of its CHIP program .  Other federally funded efforts include :  * In Cooperstown , N.Y. , Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital has hired three " circuit-rider " outreach workers to travel to schools rural areas with enrollment .  * In Atlanta , a community health center , West End Medical Centers , is boosting efforts to find uninsured children using social networks such as Facebook .  * New Mexico is setting up a dozen self-service kiosks in community centers , libraries and Head Start facilities to enroll children .  150 children signed up  In St. Louis , the door knockers have worked on enrollment since March , helping to sign up more than 150 children for Medicaid or CHIP . Like Ball , many are uninsured but will be eligible for Medicaid or federal subsidies to buy coverage when the main parts of the health law take effect in 2014 .  Their efforts are funded by St. Louis Children 's Hospital , which got a $1 million federal grant and gave $600,000 of it to MOSES ( Metropolitan Organizations Strengthening and Empowering Society ) , a coalition of 35 mostly black churches known for its grass-roots organizing . MOSES contacted Covenant House to find young people for the project . Many of the canvassers were on Medicaid as children the need .
