week 36 : ray stevens , jester of the tea party set  a.v. club head writer and hip-hop specialist nathan rabin recently decided to spend a year or two immersing himself in the canon of country music , a genre he knew little about , but was keen to explore . the result : " nashville or bust , " a series of essays about seminal country artists . after 52 entries , rabin plans to travel south and explore some of country music 's most hallowed landmarks and institutions .  i 've been a comedy obsessive since my dad gave me a copy of woody allen 's without feathers when i was 10 . " weird al " yankovic was my first idol , and the inspiration for my ill-fated third-grade novelty band nathan &amp; the rockers . and yet i did n't really get into audio comedy until a few years ago . now my ipod is full of comedy albums from folks like bob newhart , woody allen , patton oswalt , jim gaffigan , demetri martin , plus at least one comedy death-ray , never not funny , and the best show on wfmu with tom scharpling .  so when i saw a a.v. clubnewswire post about country cut-up ray stevens scoring a big comeback with an anti-immigration song i figured now would be the perfect time to immerse myself in the music , the magic , and the wonder of the most successful country novelty act of all time . it was as if fate itself was admonishing me to explore the evolution of the man behind such timeless apogees of sophisticated comedy as " ahab the arab . "  i 'd long been fascinated by stevens as a cultural figure , a sad-faced clown whose goofball oeuvre reflects the cultural zeitgeist . during the three weeks or so when streaking constituted the hottest fad , stevens raced into the studio and released the instantly dated novelty smash " the streak . " when the twin towers fell , stevens responded with " osama yo ' mama . " and when the election of president obama drove the right wing to dress up like founding fathers in a misguided principles that made it great , stevens cannily reinvented himself as the jester of the tea party set , a real-life bob roberts .  stevens was n't always defined by his politics . throughout the ' 60s and ' 70s , he was a respected nashville professional , a&amp;r man , busy session musician , producer , and songwriter who worked with titans like dolly parton and elvis presley . as a recording artist , stevens specialized in silly novelty songs like " gitarzan , " but he was also the first artist to record kris kristofferson 's hangover classic " sunday mornin ' comin ' down . " some of stevens ' biggest hits , like " everything is beautiful , " were maudlin and sentimental instead of goofy and ridiculous . but on 2010 's we the people , stevens defiantly , unmistakably threw in his lot with birthers , tea partiers , and everyone else convinced that obama is transforming our nation into a socialist nightmare . in doing so , he ensured that he will forever be associated with ultra-conservative politics .  listening to we set , i experienced the opposite of joy and laughter . the mere sight of stevens on the cover of we the people , peering out at me with cold , dead eyes while dressed like a tea party lunatic , sends me into an apoplectic rage . stevens ' dispiriting oeuvre filled me with profound sadness and emptiness . when narrow-minded people dismiss country as the music of xenophobic , cornball , maudlin , flag-waving jackasses who luxuriate in their ignorance , they 're taking about stevens , who embodies every negative country stereotype in unusually pure form .  the stevens of we the people is a real-life version of mr. show 's c.s. lewis jr. , a cartoonish super-patriot railing semi-coherently about tax-and-spendocrats who want to soil god 's own u.s.a. with their rascally socialist schemes , baby-murdering , and nonsensical earth-protecting . that foolishness about global warming do n't hardly make no sense to stevens . since stevens moonlights as one of our top climate-control scientists , i think we should all take his views on global warming very seriously .  we the people 's insufferable famous white man who proudly proclaims he gets his ideas from sean hannity , rush limbaugh , glenn beck , and bill o'reilly , stevens now feels qualified to speak for the sum of the american people , all of whom are apparently ready to revolt over our president 's mild health-care reforms .  the title track , written by veteran songwriter max t. barnes , crows " you vote obamacare / we 'll vote you out of there / we the people have awakened to your tricks " before quipping that if politicians " had the common sense that god gave a billy goat , " they 'd realize that salt-of-the-earth americans like himself are onto the kind of " pork-barrel special-interest tax-and-spend scam " that health care represents . in the tradition of protest singers from woody guthrie to pete seeger to billy bragg , stevens augments his incisive political commentary with an enthusiastically blown raspberry , a foghorn to cover up profanity , and all manner of wacky sound effects , always the sign of a sophisticated musical manifesto .  in the video , stevens -- -- pretends a plunger is a guitar , wears founding-father garb , and stares vacantly while lip-syncing lyrics like " we 've heard from hannity , beck , and limbaugh what you got in mind for grandma / and we found this o'reilly fella on fox / we 're kind of like joe the plumber / and when we crunch the numbers , it all adds up to voting you out at the ballot box . "  i love how stevens sings of bill o'reilly as if the fox fixture were some sort of homespun philosopher whom stevens and his fellow intellectual seekers came upon spouting common-sense wisdom , whittling at the corner store , and smoking a corncob pipe , rather than an obnoxiously ubiquitous blowhard with a pulpit that stretches across our fine nation . the production values , performances , and sentiments expressed in the video are pure public access , yet the video has wracked up more than 3 million views on youtube . stevens has done well for himself underestimating the intelligence of the american people .  " we the people " sets the caribou barbie , " shimmies defiantly under it . stevens , once again looking simultaneously bored and dispirited , sings sarah palin 's praises in the most effusive manner imaginable , hailing her heretofore-unknown integrity and respect for the constitution , flying the flag for her 2012 political run , and attacking the liberal media for " slicing and dicing " her interviews . in stevens ' mind , at least , there exists uncut footage of palin 's interview with katie couric which reveals the former alaskan governor to be an erudite , dignified stateswoman with a deep , comprehensive grasp of the subtleties and nuances of international politics .  but it is n't all wacky , ill-informed political discourse and zany sound effects . stevens veers schizophrenically from asinine gags to shameless sentimentality , as evidenced by tracks like " thank you , " where stevens shakes his head in disgust over all those flag-burning protestor types who refuse to acknowledge the heroism of our fighting men and women .  but none of these crimes against music and comedy has generated the stir of stevens ' anti-illegal-immigration stevens ' songs , it 's incredibly lazy , yet also tries way too hard . stevens seems to realize that his songs are devoid of funny lyrics , amusing ideas , insight , humanity , or any redeeming facet , so he piles on leaden shtick : silly , vaguely offensive accents ; zany fake public-service announcements ; and most noxiously of all , stevens ' trademark idiot chuckle of self-satisfaction . a typical stevens concoction is a misbegotten cross between a vaudeville sketch , morning-zoo wackiness , and a diatribe from your racist uncle .  we the people offers nothing but reactionary politics and pandering schmaltz delivered with supreme condescension . the songs on stevens ' career-retrospective box set are largely apolitical , but stevens ' love of crude ethnic stereotypes hints at the xenophobia that pervades we the people . in " osama yo ' mama , " stevens borrows the " middle eastern " setting on his casio keyboard ( previously heard on his earlier hit " ahab the arab " ) to deliver a tongue-lashing to osama bin laden for embarrassing his mother with his doubt that bin laden 's mother speaks in a cartoonish backwoods drawl . the song is now laden with historical irony , since stevens seemed convinced that bin laden 's capture was imminent . nine years , two wars , and tens of thousands of deaths later , we 're no closer to catching bin laden then we were on september 12 , 2001 .  stevens has a reputation as the " weird al " yankovic of country , but that association does a tragic disservice to mr. yankovic . if anything , " weird al " is the anti-ray stevens . " weird al " is a force for good in the universe , a talented , smart , funny , big-hearted icon whose music has brought joy and laughter to millions . to paraphrase a simpsons line , " weird al " es bueno , ray stevens es el diablo .  my extreme dislike of stevens is partially political and partly artistic . in spite of his bona fides as a respected musician and producer , the arrangements on box set are easy-listening bland and sterile , . stevens does n't seem to understand the craft of comedy . his timing is awful , his delivery is smug and patronizing , and his kitchen-sink approach reeks of desperation . i did n't laugh once listening to the 73 ray stevens songs in my ipod . it proved the opposite of edifying:listening to stevens actively made me stupider . he is the first , and hopefully last , artist i 've covered in this column whose work is almost entirely devoid of merit . thankfully , at this point i feel like i 've listened to enough country to confidently state that he 's the exception rather than the rule : an enormously successful veteran who has taken much from pop culture without giving anything back in return .
