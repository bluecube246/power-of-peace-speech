<p> Yesterday was Flag Day , the one day of the year dedicated to Americans celebrating their national colors , but today , June 15 , is actually a much more important holiday : Cheer Up Keanu Day . After a paparazzi image of a forlorn-looking Keanu Reeves sitting on a bench and eating lunch made its circuit through the magically arbitrary world of Internet Meme-land , someone started up a Facebook event called " Cheer Up Keanu Day , " urging fans of the actor to send him " letters , emails , gifts , and any other niceties and kind words " to let him know just how much he means to them . As of this post , there are over 14,000 confirmed participants . In the succinct words of Keanu , " Whoa . " <p> The star of such classics as Johnny Mnemonic and Chain Reaction is an easy target for cynical Internet snark-peddlers . ( In fact , my not-particularly-clever reference to him as " the star of such classics as Johnny Mnemonic and Chain Reaction " is a perfect example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endearing : The idea that we as a virtual world can take a day to earnestly praise what we would usually scoff . So , in the spirit of the holiday , I 'd like to take this opportunity to enumerate the reasons I appreciate Keanu : <p> 1 . He is often front-and-center in movies of such pure testosteroned awesomeness they threaten to burn out your eyeballs . Examples : Point Break , Speed , The Matrix . <p> 2 . He regularly donates to cancer research funds , and even reportedly gave millions of his own earnings to the behind-the-scenes crew of The Matrix . <p> 3 . Reeves is really good in My Own Private Idaho . <p> 4 . I used to watch his version of Babes in Toyland all the time as a kid . <p> 5 . Wyld Stallyns ! ! ! ! <p> 6 . Can you honestly imagine anyone else as Neo ? <p> 7 . He never comes across as anything but a nice guy who does what he enjoys , has gotten to work with some amazing directors ( Gus Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linklater ) and rightly feels no need to apologize for it .
