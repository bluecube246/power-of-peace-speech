Tasigna Surpasses Efficacy Of Gleevec In Newly Diagnosed Adult ...

<p> An 18-month median follow-up clinical trial has revealed superior efficacy with Tarigna ( nilotinib ) capsules in comparison to Gleevec ( imatinib mesylate ) tablets in adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML ( Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia ) in chronic phase 1 . Tasigna produced considerably deeper levels of molecular response than Gleevec in front-line Ph+ CML and lessened progression to accelerated phase and blast crisis , resulting in a lower number of deaths due to CML1 . Of note , three times more patients achieved undetectable disease at the molecular level with Tasigna compared to Gleevec1 Additionally , Tasigna surpassed Gleevec in other important measures of treatment efficacy . <p> Richard Larson , MD , ENESTnd study investigator and Director of the Hematologic Malignancies Program at the University of Chicago , said : <p> Tasigna demonstrates that by more selectively inhibiting BCR-ABL , the key driver of Ph+ CML , we can reduce progression to advanced disease even further than with the current gold standard Gleevec . The efficacy and safety findings achieved by Tasigna in this study provide patients and physicians with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was major molecular response ( MMR ) at 12 months ; a secondary endpoint was complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR ) by 12 months . Planned follow-up is for five years . <p> Patients on the Gleevec treatment arm who had suboptimal response or treatment failure were allowed to escalate dose and/or switch to Tasigna via a protocol extension . The data presented at ASCO was the 18-month median follow-up . <p> MMR ( major molecular response ) was defined in the study as reduction in the level of the abnormal BCR-ABL gene to less than or equal to 0.1% of the pretreatment level based on an internationally agreed standard . <p> At the 18-month median follow-up , three times more patients in the ENESTnd study achieved undetectable disease at the molecular level ( BCR-ABL levels at 4.5-log reduction ) with Tasigna than with Gleevec . CCyR indicates that no CML cells containing the diagnostic Philadelphia chromosome can be seen in a sample of bone marrow taken from the patient . Results showed that fewer patients progressed to accelerated phase or blast crisis on Tasigna at 300 mg twice daily ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n = 1 ) versus Gleevec at 400 mg once daily ( n = 12 ) 1 with 18 months of median follow-up , demonstrating an improvement in disease control . Results also revealed fewer deaths due to CML on Tasigna at 300 mg twice daily ( n = 2 ) and 400 mg twice daily ( n = 1 ) versus Gleevec at 400 mg once daily ( n = 8 ) . Rate of MMR and CCyR remain better for Tasigna compared to Gleevec at the 18-month median follow-up . All patients had at least 16 months of treatment or discontinued early ; the median follow-up was 18 months . Overall , 80% , 81% and 75% of patients remained in the study on Tasigna 300 mg twice daily , Tasigna 400 mg twice daily and Gleevec 400 mg once daily , respectively . Tasigna and Gleevec were both well tolerated overall . Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events or laboratory abnormalities were : <p> Fewer patients taking Tasigna discontinued due to adverse events versus Gleevec . No patients in the study had prolongation of QT interval &gt;500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment arms . <p> A disease in which the body produces cancerous white blood cells . The vast majority of CML patients have an abnormality known as Philadelphia chromosome , which produces BCR-ABL . BCR-ABL is a protein that causes malignant white blood cells to reproduce . Globally , CML is responsible for about 10% to 15% of all adult cases of leukemia , with an incidence of one to two cases per 100,000 people per year . <p> Please note : If no author information is provided , the source is cited instead . <h> Contact our news editors <p> For any corrections of factual information , or to contact our editorial team , please see our contact page . <p> Please note : Any medical information published on this website is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a health care professional .
