Plight of the Funny Female

a few years ago , laura mickes was teaching her regular undergraduate class on childhood psychological disorders at the university of california , san diego . it was a weighty subject , so occasionally she would inject a sarcastic comment about her own upbringing to lighten the mood . when she collected her professor evaluations at the end of the year , she was startled by one comment in particular :  " she 's not funny , " the student wrote .  mickes realized that university students did n't seem to welcome , or even notice , the wit of many of her female colleagues . she 's not the only one . a recent graphic made by ben schmidt , an assistant professor of history at northeastern university , analyzed the words used to describe male and female professors across 14 million reviews on ratemyprofessor.com . in every single discipline , male professors were far more likely than female ones to be described as funny .  " i thought , ' maybe i 'm not that funny , ' " mickes said . a great time with my female friends . "  mickes 's story triggered the familiar shot/chaser of recognition and unease in me . i come from the kind of family that deals with minor adversity by making relentless fun of the petty tyrants responsible . ( major adversity , we smother in smoked meats . ) given three adjectives to describe me , most of my female friends would list " funny " as one of them . but i maybe make a man laugh once every other month .  men might say , " i would love to have a girlfriend who would make me laugh . " but for men , that 's a luxury , not a necessity .  on one hand , we live in the golden age of female comedy . tina fey , lena dunham , mindy kaling , abbi jacobson , ilana glazer , and their ilk certainly are n't the first women to have wildly popular tv shows based entirely around their own funniness . but they might be some of the first to do it with fearless jokes about the first female comedian to headline madison square garden .  women , suffice it to say , are funny . on the other hand , happy hours during which one man holds forth to a gaggle of raptly amused female onlookers exist . mickes 's year-end review exists . my deftly hilarious female friends exist , and many are eternally single . if men and women are clearly capable of being equally funny , why does humor by non-famous women so often go unappreciated ?  * * *  in 2012 , mickes decided to see whether her student had a point . ( or rather , " i decided to redirect my anger into something productive , " as she described it . )  a common way scientists measure funniness is by making undergrads -- the typical guinea pigs for social-science research -- play a version of thenew yorker cartoon-caption contest . for her study , mickes asked 32 students to write captions for 20 new yorker cartoons . the men were " pretty excited about the task , " but the women were more reluctant . looked horrified and said , ' uh , but i 'm not funny , ' " she recalled .  after the students finished writing their quips , a new set of participants rated the captions . they found the men 's punch-lines to be ever-so-slightly more clever -- about .11 points more on a five-point scale .  the difference was small , but still , mickes was horrified by the results . " i thought ' forget it , i 'm never going to do research again , ' " she said .  past research on gender and new yorker cartoons had been mixed . in a 2011 study in the journal intelligence , male participants also penned more amusing captions than women did . but in a study the year before , the men 's and women 's one-liners were equally droll .  mickes 's study revealed another interesting difference : men wrote some of the best jokes , but they also used more profanity and sexual humor , and those jokes were n't rated very funny . if men were truly the funnier sex ,  in a later experiment , mickes gave both male and female participants a list of random words , such as " beef jerky " and " water slide , " and asked them to write paragraphs using the words . without prompting , the men wrote funny paragraphs . the women 's paragraphs were more creative and better-written , but they were n't funny . however , a surprising thing happened when mickes explicitly told the participants to try to be funny in their paragraphs : both genders used humor , and in equal measure .  as in hockey , it appears , so in lols : you miss 100 percent of the shots you do n't take . the 2011 intelligence study similarly found that men wrote more captions overall , both funny and lame . in other words , men make more attempts at humor , so they are successful more of the time .  " men are willing to take more risks in humor , and they also fail more miserably , " gil greengross , an evolutionary psychologist with aberystwyth university in wales and , " it 's worth it . if you fail and you 're not funny , you lost maybe a few minutes . but if the person laughs , the benefit can be huge . "  men make so many joke-attempts , in fact , they are assumed to be funnier -- even when they 're not . after they had finished captioning , the students in mickes 's study filled out a questionnaire about how funny they thought others would find their captions , and also whether they thought men or women were the funnier sex in general . male participants said that , on a scale from one to five , their cartoons were an average of 2.3 in funniness . the women gave themselves a 1.5 . even worse , 89 percent of the women and 94 percent of men responded that men , in general , are funnier .  in a follow-up experiment , mickes asked a new set of participants to read the captions generated by the first group and guess the gender of the writer . both men and women misattributed the funnier somehow try harder , " she mused . " and maybe over time they 're encouraged more to be funny . "  * * *  but why do men try so hard to make people laugh ?  to get some , mostly . not everyone endorses evolutionary psychology , but those who do would say that women tend to be more selective in choosing their mates than men are because historically , motherhood has been a life-threatening , all-consuming endeavor . if a cavewoman picked the wrong caveman , she might risk a grueling childbirth only to end up raising an illness-addled child without the help of a skillful mate . thus , choosiness becomes paramount . it behooves women to find a partner who will bestow sufficient time , resources , and good genes on their children -- in other words , a smart man .  funny people are more likely to be smart . ( in one of the many new yorker studies , the students who scored higher on intelligence tests also generated the funniest captions . ) humor " signals a kind of understand what someone else will find funny , " david buss , an evolutionary psychologist , explained . " it requires social intelligence , and it takes social verve or confidence . "  since most people do n't go to bars with their completed sudoku puzzles pinned to their chests , we rely on humor as a proxy for intelligence . on average , women tend to use their laughter to lure in potential mates , while men use their jokes to attract as many women as they can .  related stories  i know what you 're thinking . " but i , a man , desire women with a good sense of humor above all else ! " #notallmen .  for decades , this response stumped psychologists . when they would ask men and women what they looked for in their long-term partners , both genders would say they wanted someone " with a good sense of humor . " it was only when researchers pressed their subjects on what they meant , specifically , by " sense of humor , " that the sex difference ; men want women who will laugh at theirs .  in 2006 , psychologists eric bressler and sigal balshine showed 210 college students images of two equally attractive members of the opposite sex . underneath each photo , they pasted either funny or not-funny statements supposedly authored by the person . female participants said they wanted the funny man , rather than the unfunny one , as a boyfriend , even when they thought the funnier man was less trustworthy . the men did not care about the women 's funniness either way .  in study later that year , bressler and balshine again found that , when considering imaginary interactions with people of the opposite sex , women said they wanted men who could make them laugh . men said it was much more important that a woman enjoy his jokes .  liana hone , a psychology postdoc at the university of missouri , came to a similar conclusion in a study earlier this year : " men prefer women who are receptive to their humor , whereas women prefer men who produce humor . " hone " spend " on a trait they 'd want in their sexual partners -- either a knack for telling jokes or an ability to appreciate them . the more they " spent " on each trait , the more their partner would embody that characteristic . women , she found , would spend just $1.91 on a mate who laughs at their jokes , but men would spend $3.03 on one .  many men might contend , " i would love to have a girlfriend or wife who would make me laugh , " said greengross , who reviewed hone 's study . " but for men , that 's more of a luxury , not a necessity . "  these preferences are n't exclusive to college students . older studies of personal ads in magazines and newspapers found that women were far more likely than men to mention seeking someone funny . later , when researchers looked at profiles on a canadian dating website , they found men were more likely to tout how funny they were , while women were likelier to say they wanted a funny in multiple countries to rank their preferred qualities in a mate , women ranked " humor " first . men ranked it third .  if men try harder to be funny , women do their best to show their appreciation , laughing more enthusiastically and frequently in male company . one study found that when men and women are talking , the amount that the woman , but not the man , laughs can predict whether the pair wants to date each other . the neuroscientist robert provine once listened in on dozens of spontaneous conversations in public spaces and identified 1,200 distinct " laugh episodes . " he found that women laughed significantly more than men did , especially when a man was nearby .  when i learned all of this , i immediately ran into the living room and asked my boyfriend if it 's important to him that his sexual partners are funny .  " apparently not , " he said .  ouch ! but also , that 's so funny ! ugh .  * * *  once , a guy and trying to decide if we liked each other . my issue with him was that he took me out for dinner at a fancy place and only ordered chocolate milk . i thought his issue was that there was another girl .  i was wrong :  " i just do n't get you ! " he exclaimed one day when we were on a walk . " you 're pretty , but you 're like ... goofy . it makes no sense . "  the way men and women laugh and joke has been so different for so long that it 's hardened into a stark , oppressive social norm . norm violators get punished , and often , that means funny women are punished , too .  in another dating-style study in 1998 , about 100 college students were shown photos of people of the opposite sex along with transcripts of interviews supposedly conducted with those individuals . in the interviews , the photo subjects came off as either funny or bland . for the women , a man 's use of humor in the interview , meanwhile , did n't make the men want to date them more -- it actually made them slightly less alluring . that 's right : the men found the pretty , unfunny women more desirable than equally pretty ones who also happened to be funny .  told that their humor is n't wanted , many women do n't bother .  it 's possible that men are indifferent to their partners ' funniness precisely because funny women are smarter . there 's some evidence that men are less attracted to women who are smarter than they are . in a study out this month in personality and social psychology bulletin , when men were introduced to women they were told had outperformed them on an intelligence test , they rated the woman as less attractive and were less likely to say they wanted to date her .  these biases have a chilling effect on women . the idea that women are n't supposed to make jokes can trigger stereotype threat , a phenomenon in which simply telling someone that their " group " tends to be bad at humor is n't wanted , many women do n't bother .  a 2001 study that analyzed casual conversations among young people found that while men told more jokes and more successful jokes in mixed company , women told many more jokes when they were in all-female groups . " evidently , " the researchers concluded , " women only joke when men are not around . "  * * *  sara benincasa is certifiably funny . she ascended the internet-comedy scene in 2008 , with a series of parody campaign-trail " vlogs " by sarah palin , whom benincasa impersonated in a beehive hairdo , rectangular glasses , and " ooo-keeeys " straight out of wasilla . more recently , she 's performed a one-woman show about agoraphobia and written several books , including a comedic novel , dc trip , which came out this month .  she 's so talented , in fact , that i was a little nervous about emailing her to ask for an interview about her relationships . i said if she wanted she could use " pejorative pseudonyms " for her " this made me think that i , too , am funny . which , given the scientific literature , made me worry that i will die alone .  benincasa said that when she was younger , in her teens and early 20s , she would soften her personality in order to please the men she was chasing romantically . she 'd tell fewer jokes and laugh more heartily at theirs . her friends would tell her that she acted differently around her boyfriends .  " i tried to play-act at being a woman , " she said . " this false me was always pretty and always ready for anything , and fun , and carefree . and the real me had a lot of things to say . the ' me ' i created was not bold and outspoken . she was not very funny . "  benincasa 's dating strategy changed after she became a comedian . " i had to be myself or the audience would n't accept it , " she says . her career now serves as a sort of man filter and they 'd better like it . her current boyfriend , she notes , is also funny , and he loves her for her wisecracking .  still , it 's depressing that for many women who are n't professional comedians , the most valuable social currency is beauty -- or worse , " being sweet . " in his infamous vanity fair piece about why women are n't funny , christopher hitchens presents humor as an essential tool men can deploy to break a woman 's defenses :  if you can stimulate her to laughter ... well , then , you have at least caused her to loosen up and to change her expression .  women can also stimulate people to laughter -- not just for the purpose hitchens had in mind , but to make a new friend , or to make an old one feel better . to impress a boss or a boyfriend 's parents . to lean in , for cryin ' out loud . if funniness is an implement of power , women deserve access to it , too .  if we is encouraged at the expense of women 's -- is there anything we can do about it ? buss is skeptical that human desire can be molded ; that a stern psa or even a shift in social mores could encourage men to seek out women who are witty rather than pretty . entrenched beliefs that are ugly and pass ? -- like racism -- persist even when people disavow them . men 's desire to be the kings of relationship comedy , meanwhile , is n't even frowned upon .  hone , from the university of missouri , is more optimistic . if humankind decides that women 's natural zaniness should be set free , mankind should start to ask funnier women out for drinks . and women could stop dating men who do n't laugh at their jokes .  " just because a trait has served an adaptive purpose does not mean we should accept it , " she said . " i like to think that there 's hope for all the funny , single ladies out there . "  most popular  more than at some point between this christmas and new year 's day -- and each and every one of them will take roughly 100 trillion intestinal microbes along for the ride .  among the various other things influenced by these gut bacteria -- like eating habits , for example -- they also help control how much , or how little , a person poops . for many travelers , " how little " is the operative phrase : by one estimate , as many as 40 percent of people experience constipation while they 're away from home , due partially to their gut bacteria 's reaction to the change of setting .  " any time you leave your general habitat , it 's throwing your gut microflora off balance , " says brooke alpert , a new york-based registered dietician . sometimes , that begins before you reach your new destination : in some people , the very act of traveling from point a to point b can cause constipation . movement stimulates the gut , so sitting on a plane or in a car for long periods of time to go while in the air or on the road can also make it more difficult once you finally sit down on the toilet .  the gop planned a dynastic restoration in 2016 . instead , it triggered an internal class war . can the party reconcile the demands of its donors with the interests of its rank and file ?  the angriest and most pessimistic people in america are n't the hipster protesters who flitted in and out of occupy wall street . they are n't the hashtavists of #blacklivesmatter . they are n't the remnants of the american labor movement or the savvy young dreamers who confront politicians with their american accents and un-american legal status .  the angriest and most pessimistic people in america are the people we used to call middle americans . middle-class and middle-aged ; not rich and not poor ; people who are irked when asked to press 1 for english , and who wonder how white male became an accusation rather than a description .  you can measure their pessimism in polls that ask about their expectations for their both counts , whites without a college degree express the bleakest view . you can see the effects of their despair in the new statistics describing horrifying rates of suicide and substance-abuse fatality among this same group , in middle age .  which is the largest nation in europe to lack a state of its own ? the catalans ? the walloons ? wrong and wrong . it is the english : population 50 million-plus , all of them under the government of a multinational entity , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland .  until recently , nobody worried much about the statelessness of the english . after all , they dominated not only the u.k. , but also for much of the past 300 years a vast global empire . the empire is gone , but its legacy of language and law and political systems endures from california to calcutta .  suddenly , though , the future of england has become a very live question . since the late 1990s , scotland has obtained more autonomy for itself . nearly 45 percent of scots governing nationalists are weighing a second try if reelected in 2016 . meanwhile , the u.k. as a whole faces a referendum on exiting the european union that could trigger a different constitutional crisis if england votes narrowly in favor of leaving the eu , but is kept in europe by scottish , irish , and welsh votes . such an outcome could prod the english to follow the scots in rethinking the united kingdom . it 's quite imaginable that sometime within the next u.s. presidential term , england could under one scenario or another part ways from scotland and emerge as a self-governing entity ( albeit with wales and a sliver of ireland still attached ) for the first time since shakespeare started his writing career .  republicans may have a lock on congress and the nation 's statehouses -- and could well win the presidency -- but the liberal era ushered in by barack obama is only just beginning .  over roughly the past 18 months , the following events have transfixed the nation .  in july 2014 , eric garner , an african american death by a new york city policeman .  that august , a white police officer , darren wilson , shot and killed an african american teenager , michael brown , in ferguson , missouri . for close to two weeks , protesters battled police clad in military gear . missouri 's governor said the city looked like a war zone .  in december , an african american man with a criminal record avenged garner 's and brown 's deaths by murdering two new york city police officers . at the officers ' funerals , hundreds of police turned their backs on new york 's liberal mayor , bill de blasio .  on the internet , search queries are used to target vulnerable consumers .  google knows the questions that people would n't dare ask aloud , and it silently offers reams of answers . but it is a mistake to think of a search engine as an oracle for anonymous queries . it is n't . not even close .  in some cases , the most intimate questions a person is asking -- about health worries that set off a chain reaction that can have troubling consequences both online and offline .  all this is because being online increasingly means being put into categories based on a socioeconomic portrait of you that 's built over time by advertisers and search engines collecting your data -- a portrait that data brokers buy and sell , but that you can not control or even see . ( not if you 're in the united states , anyway . )  if a pulitzer-finalist 34-part series of investigative journalism can vanish from the web , anything can .  the web , as it appears at any one moment , is a phantasmagoria . it 's not a place in any reliable sense of the word . it is not a repository . it is not a library . it is a constantly changing patchwork of perpetual nowness .  digital information itself has all kinds of advantages . it can be read by machines , sorted and analyzed in massive quantities , and disseminated instantaneously . " except when it goes , it really goes , " said archive . " it 's gone gone . a piece of paper can burn and you can still kind of get something from it . with a hard drive or a url , when it 's gone , there is just zero recourse . "  the islamic state is no mere collection of psychopaths . it is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs , among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse . here 's what that means for its strategy -- and for how to stop it .  what is the islamic state ?  where did it come from , and what are its intentions ? the simplicity of these questions can be deceiving , and few western leaders seem to know the answers . in december , the new york times published confidential comments by major general michael k. nagata , the special operations commander for the united states in the middle east , admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the islamic state 's appeal . " we have not defeated the idea , " he said . " the past year , president obama has referred to the islamic state , variously , as " not islamic " and as al-qaeda 's " jayvee team , " statements that reflected confusion about the group , and may have contributed to significant strategic errors .  in his new book , a nobel laureate outlines how the huge disparity arose and the huge course correction needed to address it .  if there 's one thing joseph stiglitz wants to say about inequality , it 's that it has been a choice , not an unexpected , unfortunate economic outcome . that 's unnerving , but it also means that citizens and politicians have the opportunity to fix the problem before it gets worse .  a guide to the returning hits and new shows on network , cable , and streaming services  2015 may have spawned the phrase " peak tv " thanks to an onslaught of shows in every format imaginable , but 2016 is n't going to offer much respite . in the coming months , terrestrial networks , premium cable , and streaming services will favorites , no matter how niche their audience . here 's a look at a fraction of what 's in store for the early months of 2016 .  sherlock : the abominable bridefriday on pbspremieres january 1  as benedict cumberbatch and martin freeman have turned into major film stars , new episodes of steven moffat 's 21st-century sherlock have been harder and harder to come by . but two years after the show 's third-season finale , viewers will get a one-off special that will de-modernize the show , taking it back to victorian times with a ghost story -- something moffat says would n't work as well in the present day . the 90-minute episode will premiere on pbs on new year 's day . season four ? you 'll have to wait until 2017 .  with the arrival of cooler weather comes the resurgence , in catalogs and department stores , of that most dubious of offerings : the two-piece set of pajamas .  granted , not all pajamas are as hilariously improbable as the collared , button-down shirt , which makes the person wearing in dreamland . but even the more casual pjs , the kind that look like something you 'd wear to yoga or third-grade gym class , seem way too hot and constricting for sleep .  i have a theory that pajamas were invented for the scenes in tv shows where couples are sitting up in bed talking , but are actually worn by very few real people . to lay around and watch netflix ? sure . but personally , i 've never seen a man fall asleep while wearing pajamas . ( that is , of course , based on my own small sample. )
