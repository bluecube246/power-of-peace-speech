from  thank you  sorry  sql server 2014 provides a comprehensive high-end database solution that can meet the emerging demands of the businesses and enterprises alike . it marks the release of microsoft 's flagship database product that provides you a platform for hybrid cloud - you can now build , deploy and manage your databases that reside both on premise as well as in the cloud . sql server 2014 includes many interesting new features . one of such new features is the new oltp engine .  i was intrigued on reading and exploring the in-memory capabilities of sql server 2014 . microsoft 's sql server 2014 promises to reap the benefits of 64-bit computing . the in-memory capabilities in sql server 2014 is facilitated by the in-memory oltp engine -- it 's integrated right into sql server 2014 . this engine is code named as " hekaton " and is an in-built feature in sql server 2014 . hakaton is a greek word that implies " 100 " . microsoft 's sql server 2014 was earlier code named as hekaton because the times . the msdn states : " new in sql server 2014 , in-memory oltp can significantly improve oltp database application performance . in-memory oltp is a memory-optimized database engine integrated into the sql server engine , optimized for oltp . " ( reference )  to use memory optimized tables in sql server 2014 , all of the following requirements should be fulfilled :  1 . ) sql server 2014 ( 64-bit ) enterprise or developer or evaluation version installed2 . ) you should have enough memory to allow for storing memory optimized database tables and indexes3 . ) you should have enough of free disk space - preferably twice the size of your memory optimized tables4. ) 64-bit processor to support the instruction cmpxchg16b to use in-memory oltp should be available  one of the most important differentiators amongst sql server 2014 and its earlier counterparts is in the former 's support for in-memory database tables . when our computer systems go slow we often increase the physical memory in the system so that you would get more ram . increasing memory does improve the performance to a problem always primarily because you need to know whether the microprocessor would support the amount of memory installed in your system , etc .  the newly introduced in-memory oltp engine in sql server 2014 enables you to create in-memory tables and then perform input output operations ( i/o ) against them in memory . performing i/o operations against these in-memory tables result in faster reads and writes as your application can read from and write to the memory much faster compared to disk reads and writes . in essence , with sql server 2014 you can now move your database tables into memory for lower latency and improved performance.to enable your database to support in-memory oltp , you should add a filegroup for the memory optimized data and also add a container to the filegroup you added .  considering that you have a database named infoworld , here 's the script that you need to execute to enable this support .  note that any database in sql server 2014 that uses memory-optimized data must have at least one file group associated . this file group should be created in place , you can create your memory optimized table with the script given below .  note that the above table is a durable table , i.e. , the contents of this database table would n't be lost in the event of a server crash or server restart . if you would like only the schema to be preserved in the event of a server restart or crash , you should specify durability=schemaonly as shown in the script that follows .
