Golden State Warriors , June 11 , 2015  Cuyahoga County is preparing to sell bonds to finance $60.4 million worth of repairs and upgrades to Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena that include a new scoreboard for the Cleveland Indians and a new roof for the Cavs . The county plans to repay the bonds with money from the sin tax . ( Chuck Crow/The Plain Dealer ) ( Chuck Crow , The Plain Dealer )  The teams have said they hope the sin tax money will be split evenly between the three stadiums .  CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Cuyahoga County government is preparing to finance $60.4 million worth of repairs and upgrades to Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena that include a new scoreboard for the Cleveland Indians and a new roof for the Cavs .  County Executive Armond Budish 's administration sponsored and introduced legislation Tuesday to cover these costs through the sale of $65 's latest 20-year tax on alcohol and cigarettes , which voters approved in 2014 .  This is the first proposed distribution of the so-called sin tax that is expected to raise $260 million for Progressive Field , Quicken Loans Arena and the FirstEnergy Stadium . The county began collecting the renewed sin taxes in August .  The $60.4 million is the cost of repairs and upgrades that the county is obligated to cover per its respective leases with the Indians and the Cavs . The non-profit Gateway Economic Development Corp . technically owns the baseball and basketball facilities and enforces the team leases on behalf of the county . Gateway 's board already has vetted the proposed improvements and agreed they fall within the lease obligations . ( You can see the detailed list below . )  Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert has fronted the money for some high-profile improvements at the Q that Gateway is obligated to cover , such as the new scoreboard and sound system that were installed before the start of last season . The team is already working on replacing the flat and curved costs .  Prior to its 2015 season , the Cleveland Indians paid for $26 million of upgrades that taxpayers were not required to cover per the lease . But taxpayers are on the hook for the new scoreboard and sound system , flooring in balcony areas and a new paint job . These are among the upgrades that will be paid for by the bond sale .  The city of Cleveland owns FirstEnergy Stadium , home of the Browns . The team and the city recently completed a two-year , $125 million renovation . The Browns fronted the total amount and is committed to absorbing $95 million of the changes . The city is kicking in $30 million over the next 15 years . The city 's portion comes from its general fund , not money raised from the sin tax . Neither the Browns -- nor the city -- will receive any money from the current bond sale proposal .  The Cavs and Indians have previously shared an estimated $135 million worth of fixes they are expected to request from sin tax money over the next decade renovation plan , the Browns ' front office has not detailed what repairs it expects the city to cover in the future .  The teams have said they hope the sin tax money will be split evenly between the three stadiums . But that decision ultimately rests with County Council , which has yet to make a decision .  The details of the proposed bond financing -- such as the interest costs and the length of the financing deal -- have not been disclosed . The legislation goes before a committee of the whole council later this month , at which time Gateway will need to layout more details .  Gateway board chairman Timothy Ofttermatt could not be immediately reached . But the post will be updated with any details he can provide .  Progressive Field :  Sound system $4,760,000  High Steel Painting $2,184,230  Concrete Resurfacing $3,000,000  Food service equipment $1,426,757  Scoreboard system $16,083,560  Mechanical HVAC $5,201,340  Fire suppression $83,992  Suite/Press Box glass $1,760,168  Suite/Balcony flooring $59,582  Surveillance system $2,856,000  Quicken Loans Arena  Flat and Cavs )  Security system $3,090,000 ( cost likely to be fronted by Cavs )  Scoreboard $9,357,611 ( cost fronted by Cavs )  Video production $4,645,828 ( cost fronted by Cavs )  Sound system $1,800,000 ( cost fronted by Cavs )  Source : Gateway  This post was updated to clarify that County Executive Armond Budish , not county council , sponsored the legislation for proposed bond sale .
