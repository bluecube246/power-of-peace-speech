The ranch at Sunset and Pecos roads in Las Vegas is scheduled to open for public tours on Friday . ( David Becker/Las Vegas Review-Journal ) <p> And for anybody who 's driven past the gates of Wayne Newton 's estate near the corner of Sunset and Pecos roads and wondered what lay behind , finding out firsthand now is possible . <p> You can check out the photo gallery above , or , starting Friday , the entertainer will offer public tours of his longtime Las Vegas estate . In addition to viewing Newton 's car collection , stage outfits that go back to his childhood and gifts presented to him by other legendary entertainers , guests can view his prize-winning Arabian horses , his menagerie of animals and the 52-acre ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fans and followers of Newton may be surprised that the estate is available for viewing at all . For the past several years , the property has been the focus of a legal battle between Newton and investors . Last fall , the property even had been put up for sale . <p> Earlier this week , Newton said that he and the partners have settled their differences . <p> " What we have done , the entire property is ours . We 've leased it for more years than I 'll ever see , and with the right and predetermined figure , which I ca n't go into , should we decide that we wanted to buy it back , that 's the figure and it 's a done deal , " Newton said . <p> Newton , who moved to Las Vegas in 1959 , purchased the first five acres of the estate in 1966 . The first house on the property -- the one in which Newton , his parents and his brother then lived -- was built between 1966 and 1968 . Newton purchased additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , construction of the property 's mansion began . It was completed in 1976 . <p> Today , the estate has eight residences , habitat for a variety of animals and birds and several natural ponds . It also has two barns with stalls for Newton 's 60 purebred Arabian horses and three horse arenas . <p> Guests will start at a visitors center across the street from the estate . There , they can purchase tickets for the tour -- packages range from $35 to $95 for adults -- view a film about Newton , and take home a Newton or Casa de Shenandoah souvenir , home decor , apparel and gift items from Kat 's Corner , named for Newton 's wife , Kathleen , or children 's items and pet accessories from Lauren 's Lair , named for Newton 's daughter , with proceeds going to Opportunity Village . <p> Visitors who opt to take the estate tour will board shuttles for a ride into the estate . There , they can view museum cases and displays containing mementos from Newton 's performing career , which began when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display are stage costumes he wore as a kid , one of which features , Newton notes , fringe his mother took from a drape . <p> Newton , in the form of recorded video played on high-definition screens , serves as tour guide . Several exhibits feature Newton 's long career as celebrity ambassador for the USO , traveling the United States and the world to entertain American troops . <p> In person , Newton is an affable tour guide who possesses both great stories and a knack for telling them , even if the military-related photos and mementos can resurrect memories laden with emotion . <p> Once while visiting troops in Vietnam -- Newton notes that he has visited troops in every U.S. conflict since Vietnam -- " I came down with a bad case of the flu , " he recalls . He asked the nurse who was treating him if he could contact anybody on her behalf back home , just to " let them know I saw you and that you 're doing great and you 're very happy doing your job . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks later , he made the call and learned from the mother that her daughter had been killed the previous week in a helicopter crash . <p> " Well , my throat went to my stomach , as you can imagine , and I still get choked up to this day when I tell this story , " Newton says . <p> " I said , ' I 'm so sorry to bother you at a time like this . ' She said , ' No , no , no , no , no . I 've been waiting for this call . ' She said , ' Had you not called , it would have been the most devastating thing that could have happened , ' notwithstanding losing her , ' because you 're the last person that saw her happy and vivacious , doing what she loved doing , and no mother wants to hear more than that . So please do n't feel bad about calling . ' " <p> Newton pauses . " It 's those kind of moments that will last me the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton has collected over the years , including movie memorabilia and gifts presented to him by other legendary performers , including Nat King Cole , Jack Benny and Elvis Presley . There 's even an old-fashioned microphone from Frank Sinatra , inscribed to " Injun " -- " He always called me that , " says Newton , who has Native American roots -- that says , " I got started with one of these when you were a papoose . Much love ... " <p> Visitors can view Newton 's car collection -- he 's partial to Rolls-Royces and Bentleys -- which includes cars once owned by Johnny Cash and Liberace , and walk inside a private jet Newton used for several years . <p> Unlike some celebrity private jets , Newton 's bears no name on its front . " I was going to call it ' Lauren , ' after my daughter , and my wife looked at me and says , ' Should n't it be named after me ? ' And the answer to that is , ' Of course , darling , ' " Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to naming it . " <p> During their tour of the grounds , guests can see the Arabian horses Newton breeds . " Our horses have produced over 96 national champions , " says Newton , who admits that , in Europe , some know him better as a horse breeder than as an entertainer . <p> Guests can see the exotic animals -- including a Capuchin monkey named Boo , a pair of penguins , birds and wallabies -- who share the estate , and view the manicured lawns , lush landscaping and spring-fed ponds that dot it . Guests who opt for higher-tiered tours also will get a peek into the estate 's mansion . <p> Newton says that , when he bought the first parcel of what would become Casa de Shenandoah , he envisioned that it someday would become the working ranch/estate it is now . He 's excited about sharing it all with fans . <p> " It 's been a challenge , to say the least , " Newton says . " But it 's all come together , and it 's come together beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that says it all .
