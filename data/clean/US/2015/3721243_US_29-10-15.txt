london - barry sanders played his only football game in london 22 years ago , when the lions met the dallas cowboys in the american bowl at wembley stadium .  sanders did n't play much in that game -- it was the exhibition season , and it ended tied at 13 -- but the hall of fame running back was reminded how much he enjoyed that trip was when he returned for a promotional appearance on behalf of the nfl this week .  " there was certainly a buzz coming over here , " sanders said , " about just the whole novelty of being here and being in a different country . "  the novelty of american football in london has long since worn off , but with the nfl 's international series now in its ninth season , the buzz about the league 's global foothold is growing louder by the day .  the lions and kansas city chiefs will meet sunday at wembley stadium in the 14th game of the series , teams with a combined 3-11 record that will 80,000 .  the nfl has agreed to host at least two regular-season games in england through 2027 , and the league will be branching out to other countries soon .  mark waller , the nfl 's executive vice president of international , said mexico and germany are the next frontiers for a league looking to grow its already $12-billion annual pie .  " i 'd be very disappointed if we were n't playing in ( one of those countries in ) 2017 , and i 'd like to think we might be able to pull it off in 2016 , " waller told the free press in a phone interview last week . " that 's the goal . we 're trying to see if we can get it done in 2016 , in one of those two . but if not , 2017 for sure . "  after playing exhibition games in berlin , tokyo and even goteborg , sweden , for years , the league decided to focus on london about a decade ago with much success .  sky sports , the primary sports on a regular basis in 2007 , and the country now gets as many as six live games a week .  thirteen of the 14 international series games at wembley stadium have sold out , and beginning in 2018 , the league will host two games a year at the tottenham hotspur soccer club 's new stadium .  the nfl this month extended its agreement to play at least two games a year at wembley through 2020 ( with an option for five more years ) , and the league is planning a fourth international game next fall after growing to three games for the first time this year .  " there 's always been a fan base here and a pretty dedicated fan base , but once we started getting the regular-season games in 2007 , i think that accelerated everything , " said neil reynolds , a former public relations manager for the nfl in europe and the current co-presenter of the league on sky sports . " you see it across the board . our tv numbers are up every year . player-participation numbers ( but it all started once we started getting the real thing . "  waller said the nfl 's focus in london always has been with an eye toward creating " enough of a fan demand to support a full season . "  and while that may or may not involve eventually having a franchise overseas , the league has done its best to slowly ramp up and test the demand for its product .  in 2013 , the nfl played two regular-season games in london for the first time . last year , the league moved the start time of one its london games -- the lions ' 22-21 win over the atlanta falcons -- from an evening to an afternoon kickoff . and this year , the league is playing games on back-to-back weekends for the first time and doing so in competition with a beloved event in the country , the rugby world cup .  next year , one nfl team could play two games in london -- one home and one road -- so the league can better assess the logistics of having a out of the realm of possibility for the nfl to play as many as eight games in london by 2025 and/or have a team based outside of the united states .  " i would like to think that we would see both , " waller said . " i would like to think that we 'd see a team outside of the u.s. , and i 'd like to think that we were playing multiple games in other markets . i think the globalization of the sport is incredibly important for the sport , and to be part of the global sporting landscape is a must these days . so , i 'd like to think that by the time we got to 2025 we 'd be in a very different place . "  the likelihood of london having its own franchise seems farfetched to some who 've watched the league struggle to return to los angeles for 20 years , not to mention players who sometimes can do without the one trip abroad they may make a year .  " i would n't want to be the lions quarterback matthew stafford . " but i think as far as the fan base and the people , i think they would embrace it . every time we 've come over here they 've had great turnout . it seems like people enjoy the game . so from that prospective , i think it would be cool . but as far as how you 'd work out home and away games and things like that , that 's something i do n't want to have to figure out . "  " i doubt ( guys would want to play for a london team ) , " receiver lance moore said . " i mean , specifically , guys who have families . are you going to move your family to london and live in london where most people have never been before ? i think that would be doing a lot of guys a disservice when it 's monetarily based because , let 's be honest , that 's what it 's about . it 's not about building a fan base . building the fan base is building challenges to having a franchise overseas , operationally and competitively . barriers such as fan interest -- about 90% of the fans for sunday 's game will come from the u.k. , with about 4% coming from the rest of europe and 4% from the united states -- and having the proper facilities , however , already have been cleared .  in germany and mexico , where the league played a regular-season game 10 years ago in front of more than 103,000 fans , there are other issues the league must solve before going down a london-type road .  germany has several world-class soccer stadiums from hosting the world cup that would be natural fits for an nfl game , but the league does not currently have an office in the country or enough support on the ground to parlay one or more games there into long-term success .  in mexico , broadcast rights , fan support and an nfl presence are not an issue , but the country 's azteca stadium needs upgrading . once the stadium is built out to support the staging of the game almost certainly will return . until then , the focus remains on london , and the nfl 's intentions are hard to miss .  " the appetite is definitely there , " waller said . " and i think that 's true of sports fans around the world now . that they want to be involved in the sports that matter around the world , and so we 're a logical choice for those fans . "
