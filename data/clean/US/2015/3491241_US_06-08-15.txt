<h> Jon Hamm and the Cruel Summer of Celebrity Breakups <p> Our worst fears were confirmed this Labor Day weekend when Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt told People on Monday that their rumored split was , in fact , real . " With great sadness , we have decided to separate , after 18 years of love and shared history , " the former favorite couple of Mad Men fans and feminists said in a statement . " We will continue to be supportive of each other in every way possible moving forward . " <p> Once , we hoped the summer reports of the two being seen together at Netflix 's Wet Hot American Summer : First Day of Camp " canoodling " -- such a mischeviously , deceptively vaue phrase to toy with our hearts -- were true . Now , we weep and dread the arrival of the tabloid covers splashing images of " lonely " Jennifer or Jon hitting the town with some new squeeze ( Jon , do n't you dare ) . <p> Typically , that wretched space between Thanksgiving and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer is proving otherwise . Countless couples once considered rock-solid by Hollywood standards have hit the skids . <p> As painful as it is for those actually going through these separations , we can not help but also burst into tears and go running for Kleenex and H ? agen-Dazs . <p> When our models of romance -- the people who give us hope that genuinely happy relationships can survive in a modern world -- crumble , how are we , their adoring fans , to cope ? We know to some this amounts to a pretty weird investment in people 's lives we do not know , but there we go . Indulge us . <p> There is something painfully fitting about the Westfeldt-Hamm breakup announcement coming at the unofficial end of the summer--a season that has been filled with an unending stream of broken celebrity hearts . <p> Below is our rundown of summer breakups with directions for how to properly mourn . <p> According to Star magazine , it was n't Hamm 's alcohol addiction that was the problem , but Westfeldt 's desire to have children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same things . " <p> Not since Amy Poehler and Will Arnett called it quits have we so questioned the bounds of love and monogamy . <p> If these two wildly endearing celebrities are can no longer charm the pants off each other ( literally ) , what hope is there for the rest of us ? <p> Hamm and Westfeldt have been together for 18 years . They began dating in 1997 , a decade before Mad Men made Don Draper a household name and the ultimate television heartthrob . <p> Danny Moloshok / Reuters <p> If the sexiest man on cable was n't going to personally sweep us off our feet , Westfeldt was the ideal surrogate for our fantasies . Dare we say it , she was almost relatable , or at least insanely admirable . <p> Sure , Westfeldt is still remarkably attractive in that unattainable Hollywood way . But she is also an age-appropriate match -- in fact , she 's a year older than Hamm -- and a successful , intelligent creative force in her own right . <p> Amal Clooney may be rocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kissing Jessica Stein and Friends With Kids did it first . Snaps for Westfeldt . <p> In turn , we respected Hamm all the more for choosing such a fine mate when every Betty , Joan , and Peggy came his way after Don Draper became a household name . <p> And now this charismatic coupling is no more . Sigh . <p> Do not under any circumstances cry for this couple . We 're not talking about Bogie and Bacall here . <p> Should this make us want to give up on romance ? On love ? On meaningful connections with intelligent adults ? Probably . Pass the damn ice cream . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Can you be more physically distraught than devastated ? If so , aim for that . <p> Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy <p> We know in our heads that the Kermit-Piggy split was all for the best . She 's a proudly independent woman and pig , and Kermit was always a bit spineless , anyways . <p> Whenever they appeared together , their relationship appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how long could that unhealthy dynamic sustain a relationship ? This was a proudly abusive relationship -- which we laughed at . <p> Then again , Kermit and Piggy were one of our earliest models of romance . Aside from our parents ( and maybe not even them ) , they served as one of the most reliable examples of a loving partnership in our lives . <p> Gary Hershorn / Reuters <p> Kermit and Piggy did not specify why they 've chosen to call it quits , only noting in their statement that " our personal lives are now distinct and separate and we will be seeing other people , pigs , frogs , et al . " <p> With the new Muppets show premiering on ABC in the fall , part of us wonders ( hopes ) that this is all cruel publicity stunt . <p> Then again , Kermit revealed he is dating someone in the marketing department at ABC named Denise . <p> Even though their split appears to be quite amicable , we 're still brokenhearted . <p> Who else in the Muppets brigade will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Somewhere between " very " and " incredibly . " In fact , why do you even need to be instructed ? We 're talking about one of the great Hollywood romances . We 're talking about love across animal kingdoms . We 're talking ... everything . <p> But then , take a deep breath , wipe your eyes , and carry on . This summer split should not shake you to the core . <p> Yes , we were all thrilled to see Affleck with Garner after his disastrous professional and personal foray into the world of J. Lo . ( Actually , that was amazing and made him seem more interesting . ) But Affleck and Garner soon became a more conventional pair of American sweethearts . <p> Danny Moloshok/Reuters <p> Yet , while we hate to sound cynical , the end of Bennifer 2.0 was a long time coming . Affleck 's ( in ) famous Academy Award speech in 2013 when he said marriage was " work " was n't the red flag . That was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was when they got a little too precious and cutesy about their relationship that the hazard lights started flashing . <p> According to New York 's The Cut , Garner seemed a little too eager to gush about Affleck 's parenting skills to the press last fall . <p> She cooed to InStyle , " No matter how much I tickle them or toss them or chase them around , it 's not the same . If I 'm the slow , steady drumbeat , he 's the jazz . " <p> Neither of these picture-bait stories seem like conclusive evidence of an affair , but if it 's true that Affleck has already moved on , it only affirms that ending his and Garner 's marriage was a bittersweet , but ultimately right , move . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Moderately and for a measured period of time . Then you should rouse yourself into action and root for Garner to bounce back with a hot younger man . <p> Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani <p> The rock star couple is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer 's rate , there will be a new one by the time this goes to press . <p> We 'd like to say we 're surprised by the split , but we 're more surprised Stefani and Rossdale lasted as long as they did . <p> Eric Gaillard/Reuters <p> The couple wed in 2002 as a match made in rock band heaven . From that point on Stefani 's fame only grew . She branched out from No Doubt to start her own musical projects , launch a fashion line , and become a judge on NBC 's The Voice . <p> Meanwhile , Rossdale was making more headlines for scandals . In 2004 , it was revealed that his goddaughter Daisy Lowe was actually his biological daughter , a product of an affair with singer Pearl Lowe when she was married . <p> A bigger threat to their marriage hit the rumor mill when Courtney Love claimed Rossdale cheated on Stefani with her . <p> In 2009 , Rossdale confirmed he had a sexual relationship with British drag queen Marilyn in the 1980s -- an admission that Marilyn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RadarOnline.com that Rossdale called him weeks before Stefani officially filed , launching into an emotional tirade where he blamed Marilyn for revealing their affair . " Gwen wants him to be something he 's not , and he wants to be something he 's not . That 's my interpretation , " Marilyn said . <p> It 's not like Stefani and Rossdale 's marriage was all bumps and bruises . Rossdale and Stefani had three sons -- Kingston , 9 , Zuma , 6 , and Apollo , 17 months -- and they oozed rock star sexiness on the red carpet . <p> Still , the couple was up against a lot of odds to work . Even Stefani admitted to Cosmopolitan in February of this year that it was " miracle " she and Rossdale were still together . We could n't agree more . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> A little , but do n't cry too much for the Rossdale-Stefani split . Applaud them for a good run and call it a day -- and hope that their absence of a pre-nup wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to the rest of the family , they were a paragon of relationship stability . <p> Kourtney remains the only Kardashian sister who has never walked down the aisle . However , her on-again , off-again relationship with Disick lasted longer than each of Kim 's and Khlo ? ' s marriages -- and , for those of you keeping count , they have four between them . <p> That does n't mean Kardashian and Disick ever won over reality TV audiences . Disick seemed like a tempest in a teapot , more in an irritating than entertaining way . <p> Disick is already expressing his regret over the split in a suspiciously public fashion . <p> On Instagram , he shared photo of a table card reading " Scott Disick guest " with the caption " When u realize the grass is n't always greener . " But the public plea for his baby mama seems more like a public plea for attention . <p> Knowing the Kardashian clan and their fame-loving straphangers , we would n't be surprised if the split was a publicity stunt . <p> Disick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family back . " <p> How sad should you be ? <p> We 're not talking about Bogie and Bacall here . Do not cry , because this breakup could end up being shorter than Kim Kardashian 's marriage to Kris Humphries . <p> Zayn Malik and Perrie Edwards <p> If you squander more than a three-second shrug on this breakup , I only have four words for you : Pull it together , dude . <p> In case you have a life , here are the details . He was in One Direction , she was in a girl band called , puzzlingly , Little Mix . He called off their engagement , she is " devastated . " Us Weekly reports that friends of Edwards say it 's a miracle she put with Malik 's erratic behavior for so long . This will run and run , believe us . <p> Yes , Malik and Edwards have been together for two years and were even engaged . But each is only 22 years old . At that age , the biggest life decision you should be making is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realistic : Ending things before they walked down the aisle probably spared them of an even more painful romantic demise . <p> Also , they are the kind of couple where their youth and hotness is only exceeded by their wealth . They are awash in sexual and materialistic comfort . They do not need your sympathy pains . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Not . At . All . This is so not the couple you shed tears over , especially in a summer rife with heartbreak that makes us question the human condition and the frailty of love .
