They are also a very popular sport fish in the Puget Sound . <p> Silvers have dark metallic blue or greenish backs with silver sides and a light belly . It is known for its red/orange meat and its richness of flavor . Its fat content is slightly lower than that of King or Sockeye salmon . <p> When purchasing silver salmon , you 'll want to look for them in late summer to early fall . You 'll want to seek out ones with shiny scales and bright eyes . If you press the flesh of the fish with your finger , it should bounce right back . The aroma of the fish should never be " fishy " - it should resemble clean , salty water . <p> When cooking silvers , they are medium in texture so they hold up well to poaching , saut ? ing or plank grilling . Silvers are lower in fat content and can benefit from a gentle cooking method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since this fish does have a lower fat content than others , be mindful that it does not dry out during the cooking process . <p> Chef Pat loves to embrace the fall season by accompanying the wild silver with chanterelle risotto and a corn succotash . <p> Heat grill to medium high .
