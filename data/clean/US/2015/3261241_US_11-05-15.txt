<h> Shaky Knees 2015 Festival Review : From Worst to Best <h> It was a sizzling three-day weekend in Hotlanta . <h> Share this : <p> Two years ago , event promoter Tim Sweetwood turned heads nationwide when he opened the gates to Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta 's cozy Historic Fourth Ward Park . The two-day lineup topped by The Lumineers , Band of Horses , and Drive-By Truckers attracted both locals and out-of-towners and proved successful enough for a return . " I was n't trying to be Bonnaroo or Coachella , " Sweetwood explained to Ryan Bray back in February . " It was n't like we were reaching for the sky . I just wanted to show people what I could do as far as my vision . " <p> The following year , the festival expanded to three days , nabbed heavy hitters like Alabama Shakes , The National , Modest Mouse , and a reunited The Replacements , and shifted the action over to Atlantic Station . Weather issues aside , the sprawling concrete parking lot accommodated the expansive crowds with ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outdoor mall and expect to have any charm or character . When Paul Westerberg 's singing " Left of the Dial " and an Old Navy sign is looming beside the stage , it 's a little hard to lose yourself . <p> Photo by Debi Del Grande <p> Yet , Sweetwood 's a smart guy , and he reckoned with these issues . " You do n't want to do the same festival every year , " he continued . " You want to grow aesthetically , and you have to make sure your booking is on point so fans are just as excited as they were the year before . " And so , the young man 's quest to bring a proper music festival to the Southern metropolis has arrived at its most exciting ( and pivotal ) chapter yet : it 's finally found a home . Who knew it was just a shade away from downtown at a chunk of grass called Central Park . <p> Prior to Mother 's Day weekend -- a trait that Sweetwood digs ( " Everyone has a mom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concern that the festivities would overwhelm the area and the smallish , family-friendly park . That might have been the case if the festival did n't also take advantage of the adjoining Renaissance Park and the nearby parking lot for the Atlanta Civic Center . Unlike last year 's sprawl , this lot is framed by grassy hills and enough foliage to shadow as an expansion to the corresponding parks . Needless to say , there was a lack of suburbanites walking by with groceries . <p> Photo by Debi Del Grande <p> The setup was very similar to how Lollapalooza takes over Chicago 's Grant Park . It was all in sections and fragments that were tied together by a united street ( in this case , Pine ) . This added a much longer walk between the stages than years prior , but it was efficient enough and also suggested that Shaky Knees may be larger than Sweetwood ever intended . Like any of the Big Four fests , he 's created a city within a city , and there 's reason to believe that his vision has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a music festival but a destination music festival . <p> That revelation might frighten him . <p> " Know that we 're committed to getting better each year , and not necessarily bigger either , " he contended . " The end goal is to sell out as a festival , but at half the capacity of the Bonnaroos and the Coachellas so that everyone there can enjoy it . We want the guy who is standing 20 feet back from the stage to enjoy it as much as the guy who is standing 200 feet back from the stage . <p> Photo by Carlo Cavaluzzi <p> " It 's a business , do n't get me wrong , " he added . " The business needs to be profitable , but when your business gets too big , sometimes it 's harder to service the ticket buyer in a way that 's really satisfying . I think if we keep things running at a medium level , we can give our fans what they 're looking for . " <p> Based on the crowds , which were never too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear that Shaky Knees might simply be walking with shoes one size too big . If that 's sustainable , excellent . Save for the notoriously long lines at the dozen local food trucks -- pretty much the only outlet for food , which is definitely a good thing -- there really were n't any hiccups in Sweetwood 's current design . The monitors at the main stage were state-of-the-art , the Buford Tent was a godsend , and the various ice pops were tasty blessings . <p> Photo by Carlo Cavaluzzi <p> Whether or not Sweetwood wants the growth is up for him to decide , but if he 's game , he 's certainly not alone . There were good vibes all weekend , supported and kept alive by a sea of people hungry for an honest music festival . If he 's smart , he 'll keep feeding ' em . And well . <p> So , what about the music ? Click ahead to see the worst and the best of the fest . Just know that " worst " is simply a designation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To quote Professor Henry Newman , there were some that were simply ... " less than . "
