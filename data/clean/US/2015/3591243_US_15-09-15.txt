A Day in the Life of NYC 's Hottest iPhone Doctor  Then One/WIRED  There 's a story behind every broken phone , and Michel Lavache has heard them all . Like the one where some guy 's girlfriend found sexy photos of a stranger on his Snapchat and tossed his phone out the car window , onto the Cross Bronx Expressway . That was bad . Or another time , when a man got fed up with his lady showing too much skin on Instagram so he threw hers out of a third-story window . It shattered the screen to bits .  Lavache is New York City 's iPhone doctor . He 's a modern-day traveling medicine man , but instead of curing bodily ills , he fixes something that 's arguably even more precious in our phone-obsessed world . He spends most of his free time running around the city with his fix-it kit , patching up iPhones that have seen better days . He is the Apple Genius bar gone mobile .  Most people 's stories , Lavache says , are run over by cars for far less lurid reasons . And toilets ? Those things are basically iPhone swimming pools . More often than not , the phones he sees have been knocked off tables or are the product of sheer clumsiness . The reason I met Lavache involved one too many Budweisers and what I 'd like to believe was an unreasonably hard bathroom floor .  The morning I meet Lavache , he 's sitting in a corner table at a cafe in midtown Manhattan , loosening the last of the tiny bolts on the frame of an iPhone 6 . He 's using a screwdriver that looks like a Barbie toy in his hands . " I 've seen a lot worse , " he says to me and Terrence , the phone 's owner . For the past month Terrence has been using a phone with a cracked screen , the result of -- he claims -- his wife knocking it off the bathroom counter while getting ready for work . " She likes to use my phone , " he explains . " She has a shatter pattern ; it starts in the upper righthand corner and fissures down to the bottom of the phone , making his screen look like a melting chunk of Arctic ice . It looks bad , but Lavache assures us it 's a simple fix . There 's no smashed camera , ruined port , or broken LCD screen -- he estimates it 's maybe a four on a scale of one ( totally usable ) to 10 ( WTF happened ! ? ) . " The top righthand corner is the worst spot for breaks , " Lavache explains , adding that most of the time it 's a bent frame that pinches the glass and causes it to crack , not a direct blow to the glass itself . " It 's probably 80 percent of the breaks I see . "  It takes Lavache 10 minutes to perform the minor surgery : He removes 14 screws , gingerly disconnects the sensors and ribbon cables from the LCD panel , swaps in a new sheet of glass , and returns the screws to their holes using the tiny who considers the newly smooth piece of glass before thrusting the phone into the air like a trophy and exclaiming , " It 's like a brand new phone ! " He pays Lavache in cash -- $110 for the fix -- and heads back across the street to his office with his brand not-quite-new phone .  Michel Lavache . Laurent Chevalier  Early fall , right around when Apple announces its new phones , is Lavache 's busiest time of the year . People are anxious to get their old phones fixed so they can trade them in and make some money . " Last year I had to use my vacation time to see people all day morning to evening , " he says of the post-Apple event buzz .  Lavache charges $110 to fix an iPhone 6 screen , $85 for a iPhone 5S , $70 for a 5 , and $45 for a 4S . He says an iPhone 6 screen costs him around $75 from his supplier in New Jersey , who gets them from someone in China . That 's $35 in revenue , which can be anywhere from $10 to $15 . Not bad for 20 minutes of work . He says he almost makes enough on the hustle to quit his job ( he works in IT at The New York Times ) and do this full time . but he does n't have any plans to do that . " What if the next iPhone has sapphire glass ? " he asks . " Then what ? "  At least for now , business is booming . That should n't surprise you : Think about how many of your friends are carrying $700 mini-computers with jacked up screens they intend to fix at some point . The rest of the technology world might change at a rapid-fire pace , but if there 's one thing you can count on , it 's that someone , somewhere just dropped a phone . And most of those people lack the combination of time , patience , and cash it takes to get it fixed at the Apple Store . This is bad news for Apple , but great news for enterprising tinkerers rapid adoption of smartphones and customer 's willingness to break their warranty for the sake of convenience and price .  Lavache is far from the only guy doing this . Services like iCracked have raised major money from investors , and IBIS Market reports that cell phone repair is a $4 billion industry . Lavache says he has competitors in the city , but he 's hardly worried . " There 's enough people breaking their phones that we can all be busy morning through night , " he says .  Even on a slow day , Lavache will fix at least a half-dozen screens . Fridays are busiest , which is partly the result of Thursday night drinking ( alcohol is iPhone enemy number one ) , but also because people want their phone working for the weekend . " People hate going on vacation with a broken phone , " Lavache says . He keeps a meticulously-organized schedule of his appointments and divides his time into 15-minute blocks . He 'll allocate an extra 15 to 30 minutes to get from one location to next , and n't go . No office buildings ( check-in takes too long ) , no bars ( too dark ) , and no apartments ( people are weird ) . Instead , he has 10 locations around the city -- mostly coffee shops -- where he 'll meet clients . He can fix things other than screens , but screens is the big business .  Today he has nine appointments . After the meeting with Terrence we hop on the A train and head downtown to meet Juliette and her nanny . At a tourist-packed Starbucks across from One World Trade Center , Juliette , 14 , explains that there 's really no story to be told . She was just walking along , and her iPhone 6 slipped out of her hand .  Lavache has heard this a lot since the 6 and 6 Plus came out . " The edges of the iPhone 6 are rounded off , " he says . That , combined with the brushed stainless steel , makes your phone as slippery as wet bar of soap . The bigger size is even worse palm . " You definitely could n't have a 6 Plus . "  This is Lavache 's second time fixing Juliette 's phone , but she 's not particularly butterfingered . He has a lot of repeat customers ; people break their iPhones like clockwork .  " Did I fix your phone on the way to the airport once ? " he wonders aloud . " Did you miss that flight , by the way ? " He did , and she did .  Lavache fixes an iphone . Laurent Chevalier  Repairing a phone is a technical skill , and Lavache is well-equipped , what with his degree in electrical engineering and IT job . But running a successful repair business is about more than just knowing which screw goes where . His business thrives or dies on Yelp and personal referrals ( I found out about Lavache from a friend who also found out about him from a friend ) . He 's really in the customer service industry .  He currently has a five-star rating on Yelp that he 's pretty damn proud of this , he 's gotten 88 reviews , all five stars except for a one-star rating from Jon D. in 2014 that he probably wishes he could scrub off his page . These public ratings are important because to most people , Lavache is a total stranger . Letting a Genius Bar employee dissect your phone is one thing -- paying a man called the iPhone Doctor upward of $100 to do it requires a whole new level of trust . And the truth is , meeting him does feel a little illicit , as though you 're sneakily subverting the Apple gods .  But Lavache is easy-going and conversational . He does n't push people to talk , but is happy to listen if they do . Lavache might not realize it , but he 's constantly maintaining a delicate balance with his customers . He 's claiming responsibility for something that 's tied so closely to personal happiness , which means he 's often entangled in other people 's strange neuroses . He 's gotten teary 2 am calls from people freaking out about a broken screen . that have text messages and photos from loved ones who had recently died . Fixing iPhones is a little like speed dating ( or speed therapy ) . " The best part of doing repairs sometimes is meeting 30 people a week in New York , " he says . " I just went to a birthday party of customer . We 're cool now because I fixed her phone . Several times . "
