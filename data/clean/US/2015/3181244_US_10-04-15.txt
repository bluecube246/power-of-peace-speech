'Miracle' in Burleson: Book tells girl's remarkable story of healing
http://www.star-telegram.com/living/religion/article18229301.html

<p> For years , the Burleson girl 's life was defined by near-constant pain , endless hospital visits , invasive testing and marginally effective treatments . At one point , she told her mother she wished she would die so she could go to heaven , where there would be no more pain . <p> But three years ago , in December 2011 , something remarkable happened . <p> Annabel fell headfirst 30 feet into a hollow cottonwood tree , where she was trapped for six hours . But she came away from the ordeal uninjured , telling a story about meeting Jesus in heaven , and she suddenly tested symptom-free . <p> Annabel 's mother , Christy Wilson Beam , has come to the conclusion that miracle is the only word that applies when explaining Annabel 's recovery . <p> Annabel 's Boston-based gastroenterologist , Dr. Samuel Nurko , did n't call it a miracle , but he did release the girl from his care last November , noting that she " is completely asymptomatic , is leading a normal life and is not requiring any therapies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Miracles From Heaven . The book , out Tuesday , is published by Hachette . <p> The Sony producing team behind the 2014 movie Heaven Is for Real has already acquired the film rights . It 's tentatively scheduled for release the week of Easter 2016 . <p> We chatted with Beam about the book and about Annabel ( whose middle name , fittingly , is Faith ) . <p> First things first : How is Annabel doing today ? <p> She is amazing . She is happy and healthy and thriving and on zero medication and eating everything in sight . Her doctors have told us she does not need their care anymore . Not only is she physically well , but she is also well mentally , emotionally and academically . In all areas of her life , she is above and beyond . <p> Have you ever been given a sound scientific explanation for what prompted her recovery ? <p> They really do n't know . My husband , Kevin , is a veterinarian and very scientifically minded . He went over everything , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Annabel 's problems involved nerve damage . Her digestive system would not process solid food because her muscles would not fire synchronically , because the nerves could not give the message to the muscles . <p> Kevin was thinking , " Well , she did hit her head three times during the fall . Maybe it jostled something in her nervous system . " But the best that anyone can do is guess . All I know is she is asymptomatic , on zero medication and released from the care of a specialist . <p> You write in the book that you initially resisted using words such ashealed and miracle.Were you afraid that if you did , you might jinx it and that Annabel 's symptoms would return ? <p> I literally felt like , " OK , when is the other shoe going to drop ? " But I eventually got past that fear . I realized that God does n't play that way . He does n't say , " Now that I got your hopes up , surprise ! That was a good joke , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What 's the most convincing evidence you have that Annabel went to heaven and came back ? <p> I talk in the book about how I had two miscarriages before we had Annabel . We continued trying -- we had faith -- because we believed God was going to bless us and that we would be able to have another child . Annabel was that child . <p> One of the miscarriages , I want to point out , was never a life created . It 's called a blighted ovum . The other was a life that was miscarried . So I find it intriguing that when Annabel talks about going to heaven , she says she saw a little girl and asked who that girl was . And Jesus told her , " That 's your sister . " <p> I find that interesting because Anna knew I had two miscarriages , but I had never explained that one was a baby and one was not . But Annabel did n't come back saying , " I saw two little girls . " She says she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You write that Kevin used a chain saw to carve a cross -- " a symbol of both suffering and salvation " -- into the trunk of the tree that trapped Annabel . Is it still standing on your property ? <p> Less than two months ago , on a day when we had high , strong winds , the tree fell over . It literally snapped in two . It broke right above where he had carved the cross into it . That part has been cleared away . But the part from the cross down , that 's still standing . <p> What do your other daughters , 15-year-old Abigail and 10-year-old Adelynn , think of the attention Annabel is getting ? They 're not jealous , are they ? <p> My youngest says she 's so grateful to have her sister back . She now has a best friend she can play with all the time . They 're inseparable . Abbie is the one with the very old soul . She remembers how Anna 's illness pulled us in so many different directions and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's going to be a lot of attention showered on Anna . But they would never want to go back to the way it was before . <p> What do you hope readers will take away from Miracles From Heaven ? <p> I believe it can help other families . I know it would have comforted me if I had read a book like this , written by someone who had made it through what we were going through . <p> I also feel that every parent can relate , even if their child does n't have a chronic illness , because there 's always some kind of struggle that requires courage and faith . <p> The book <p> Miracles From Heaven : A Little Girl , Her Journey to Heaven and Her Amazing Story of Healing goes on sale Tuesday . <p> Published by Hachette , it is $24 . <p> Meet the author <p> Christy Wilson Beam 's book tour includes these North Texas locations : <p> ?
