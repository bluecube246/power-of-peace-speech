BUFFALO , N.Y . -- Scientists at the University at Buffalo 's Research Institute on Addictions ( RIA ) are studying chronic stress and depression , with a focus on endocannabinoids , which are brain chemicals similar to substances in marijuana .  The findings raise the possibility that components of marijuana may be useful in reducing depression that results from chronic stress .  " In the animal models we studied , we saw that chronic stress reduced the production of endocannabinoids , leading to depression-like behavior , " says RIA senior research scientist Samir Haj-Dahmane , PhD .  Endocannabinoids are naturally produced chemical compounds in the brain that affect motor control , cognition , emotions and behavior . As the name suggests , they are similar to the chemicals found in marijuana ( Cannabissativa ) and its active ingredient , **28;0;TOOLONG ( THC ) .  " Chronic stress is one of the major causes of depression , " Haj-Dahmane says . " Using compounds derived from cannabis -- marijuana -- to restore normal endocannabinoid function could potentially help stabilize moods and ease depression " Our research thus far has used animal models ; there is still a long way to go before we know whether this can be effective in humans , " he says . " However , we have seen that some people who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder have reported relief using marijuana . "  Haj-Dahmane says the next step in the research is to see if using a marijuana extract , cannabidiol ( CBD ) , restores normal behaviors in the animals without leading to dependence on the drug .  The study , co-authored by Roh-Yu Shen , PhD , RIA senior research scientist , was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health . It appeared in the fall issue of the Journal of Neuroscience .  Medical marijuana remains a controversial issue . Although 23 states and the District of Columbia have approved its use to provide relief for health problems such as glaucoma , nerve pain , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis and nausea from chemotherapy , some experts are concerned that medical use of marijuana may normalize attitudes about the drug and completely safe .  RIA is a research center of the University at Buffalo and a national leader in the study of alcohol and substance abuse issues . RIA 's research programs , most of which have multiple-year funding , are supported by federal , state and private foundation grants . Located on UB 's Downtown Campus , RIA is a member of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and a key contributor to UB 's reputation for research excellence . To learn more , visit buffalo.edu/ria.
