1 . Avocado , avocado , avocado  Ripe , creamy and oh-so-versatile , the popularity of the humble avocado has soared in recent years .  Not only does it pair perfectly with bacon , but research suggests avocado can actually help to speed up your metabolism . The unique combination of essential fatty acids , monounsaturated fats and antioxidants keeps blood vessels clear and inflammation down , say experts .  New York-based Instagrammer Minimalist Pantry suggests smashing it on a bagel with a fried egg . While San Antonio , Texas-based food lover Sarah Baade slices it into a breakfast taco , with scrambled egg , grated cheese , diced pepper and red onion . YUM .  2 . Try inventive combinations  Take a hint out of Mexican Instagrammer Virginia Guzman 's book and try adding olives to ham and cheese to give your sandwich a salty kick .  And who says you ca n't eat cake for breakfast ? Food bloggers May Lee and May Ling from Kuala Lumpur made this healthy breakfast cake by mixing yoghurt with apple and tea , tey tarik.  3 . See your fridge resourcefully  Breakfast can be a meal , or it can be a vehicle for reinventing leftovers into new taste combinations .  Instagrammer Michaela Thai in Frankfurt whipped up this new version of Middle Eastern favorite shakshuka with leftover roast chicken -- adding tinned tomatoes , paprika , chili and egg to the shredded chicken and veg .  Last night 's rice clogging up your fridge ? Fry it with onion , cumin , chili and turmeric for a quick version of uggani , a light but filling rice breakfast popular in the Rayalaseema region of southern India .  Top it off with lemon juice , coriander , a few peanuts and hey presto -- you 'll have an exotic morning meal like the one pictured here by Mohan K. Reddy on Twitter . He enjoyed it alongside some mirchi bajji -- deep fried green chilies stuffed with potato .  4 . Go international  We 'd all love to hop on a plane for breakfast , but in today 's cosmopolitan cities chances are you probably international flavors -- like this Filipino breakfast of a coconut and rice wrap from Billy Tejada .  Failing that , bring global classics to your own kitchen with a Spanish tortilla , like this one here enjoyed in San Sebastian by food fanatic Prachi Joshi . Fry finely sliced onion and potato in a non-stick pan , pour over beaten eggs and top with a lid . Wait until the base is cooked before using a plate to flip it over .  Or perhaps you have a sweeter tooth , in which case you 'd do well to recreate Billy Sountornsorn 's London brunch of pancakes with ricotta , honey and fruit .  Now that 's what we call a breakfast worth getting up for .  Next challenge : we 're onto LUNCH .
