<h> The Impact Of New Hepatitis C Drugs On National Health Spending <p> Those who follow Altarum Institute 's monthly health sector briefs and trend reports are well aware that the five-year run of record low growth rates in national health spending ( from 2009 through 2013 ) has come to an end , or at least been interrupted . According to data just released by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , health spending grew by 5.3 percent in 2014 , compared to 2.9 percent in 2013 and roughly 4 percent from 2009 through 2012 . Our estimates for the first eight months of 2015 show growth of 6.2 percent , though on a downward path , indicating that the year could finish at around 6 percent growth . <p> Many analysts had predicted well in advance an increased health spending growth rate for 2014 due to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) . The expanded coverage provisions of the ACA were expected to increase the number of persons with health insurance and hence health spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump in prescription drug spending that occurred in 2014 was unforeseen . In 2013 , spending on prescription drugs grew by only 2.4 percent , but in 2014 , it skyrocketed to 12.2 percent . Some of this increase in spending on prescription drugs is due to expanded coverage , and some is due to the acceleration in prescription drug prices . <p> A major source of this growth was the introduction of Sovaldi in December 2013 , and Harvoni in October 2014 . Both are very expensive breakthrough drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C ( a disease of the liver , affecting approximately 3 million Americans ) . The new hepatitis C drugs have had a significant impact on growth rates in spending on prescription drugs and on national health spending . <h> Company Sales Of New Hepatitis C Drugs <p> I use company reports to track quarterly U.S. sales of the four bestselling new prescription drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C : Harvoni and Sovaldi ( Gilead Sciences , Inc . ) , Viekira Pak ( AbbVie ) , and Olysio ( Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical to the final sales captured in health spending , they provide a basic sense of the impact of hepatitis C drugs on overall health spending growth rates ( Note 2 ) . <p> The quarterly sales are shown in Figure 1 . Combined sales were $100 million in Q4 2013 , jumping to $2.4 billion and $3.8 billion in Q1 and Q2 2014 . In Q3 , sales of the existing drugs fell to $2.9 billion , presumably due to the expected release of a more appealing drug , Harvoni , in October . Starting in Q4 2014 , sales moved back to $3.5 billion and have stayed in that range during the first three quarters of 2015 . <h> Figure 1 : Quarterly Company Sales Of New Drugs To Treat Hepatitis C <h> Impact On 2014 Growth In Health Spending <p> National health spending in 2013 was about $2.9 trillion . In 2014 , company sales of the new hepatitis C drugs were $12.3 billion higher than in 2013 . This represents 0.4 percent of total health expenditures in 2013 , and suggests that the new hepatitis C drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . In the absence of these new drugs , national health spending would have grown by about 4.9 percent rather than 5.3 percent . <p> Prescription drug spending in 2013 was $265 billion . Similar math suggests that the new hepatitis C drugs added about 4.6 percentage points to the growth in prescription drug spending in 2014 . The total growth rate in prescription drug spending in 2014 was 12.2 percent , so we estimate that it would have been 7.6 percent in the absence of the new hepatitis C drugs . That latter would still have been a large increase relative to the 2.6 percent growth seen in 2013 for prescription drugs and is likely due to a combination of expanded coverage and accelerated price growth . <h> Likely Impact On 2015 Growth In Health Spending <p> While spending on hepatitis C drugs in 2015 remains very high ( $14.4 billion is a reasonable estimate , assuming $3.5 billion in Q4 ) , it represents a much smaller increase ( $1.9 billion ) than experienced in 2014 ( $12.3 billion ) . This means that in 2015 , hepatitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growth rate in national health expenditures and 0.6 percentage points to the growth rate in prescription drug spending . <p> To put it another way , the relatively small increase in hepatitis C spending in 2015 should reduce the overall rate of growth in national health expenditures by more than 0.3 percentage points compared to the growth rate in 2014 . For prescription drugs , it should bring the growth rate down by about 4 percentage points ( Note 3 ) . <p> Our November health sector spending brief shows that the growth rate in spending on prescription drugs has indeed been falling in 2015 and , as of September , was at 8.4 percent , year over year . This is 3.8 percentage points below the growth rate in 2014 , and we attribute much of the decline to the leveling off in spending on hepatitis C ( Note 4 ) . <p> The decline in the prescription drug spending growth rate in 2015 has been more than offset by a higher rate of growth in spending on health care services so that , in September , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the rate for 2014 . In the absence of the prescription drug spending slowdown , the September growth rate would have been about 5.9 percent . <h> Implications For 2016 And Beyond <p> I conclude with speculation about the future using rough estimates that I believe nonetheless provide some useful information . U.S. sales of hepatitis C drugs seem to have stabilized at about $14 billion per year , which equates to about 150,000 persons treated per year ( at a rate of $90,000 per person treated ) . <p> Of course , the amount we actually spend per year over the next few years could be higher or lower than what we spent in 2015 . Recent recommendations argue for treatment of nearly all diagnosed cases , yet many states and other payers continue to prioritize candidates for treatment based on severity of illness and other factors . This means that the near-term rate of spending is quite unpredictable and depends upon how much effort is put toward identifying and treating existing cases , how much resistance there is to approving treatment , and what competition might do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curative powers of these drugs should drive hepatitis C prevalence , and therefore spending , to very low levels . <h> Note 1 <h> Note 2 <p> One difference is the lag between when the sale ( to an intermediary ) is recorded by the company and when the final sale is made to the consumer . Another is that retail markups are included in health spending but not in company sales . Finally , prescription drug sales in the national health accounts refer only to retail sales , while company sales include sales to hospitals and physicians for drugs administered during the health encounter and whose costs are embedded in the hospital or physician bill . The vast majority of hepatitis C drugs are sold at retail . <h> Note 4 <p> The leveling off we observe in company sales in 2015 runs counter to a recent report stating that Medicare spending on these drugs grew by $4.5 billion in 2015 . Some of this may be due to lags between company sales to intermediaries and the subsequent sales to Medicare patients . We have not built lags into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2014 impact and understated the 2015 impact . <h> Comments <p> That seems like a reasonably accurate way of putting it . Using your language , the " wound " is bound to heal eventually because of the curative properties of the drug . As more and more patients are cured , there will be fewer patients with the disease and fewer new patients per year contracting the disease . Eventually , spending on these drugs should begin to drop toward zero ( the wound heals ) . But it could be many years before that happens . <p> You suggest that Hepatitis C drugs will have a less than .1% affect on national health expenditures , but would it be fair to say that this simply means the sizable impact on yearly health expenditures it created ( .4% to total expenditures and 4.6% to prescription drug expenditures ) is simply the new normal and any additional increases will be relatively muted ? That is to say , the bleeding is has stopped , but the wound is n't healing anytime soon . <p> December 16th , 2015 at 10:15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use .
