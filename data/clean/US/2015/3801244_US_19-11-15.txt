A Brief History Of America 's Surprisingly Long Love Affair With Porn  This is n't your grandma 's porn . ( Actually , it might be . )  Warning : This post is filled with explicit imagery . Very NSFW . Proceed with caution .  Artist Unknown c. 1930s  " What would her parents think ? ! "  The paternalistic , pearl-clutching questions we ask about contemporary porn actors might seem a little more naive after visiting " Hardcore , " an exhibit currently on display at the Museum of Sex in New York . Though we like to imagine our forebears lived in more innocent times , the parents and grandparents and great-grandparents of today 's adult film stars might very well have been performing in -- or at least avidly consuming -- explicit erotica of their own .  " People tend to think that hardcore pornography is largely a modern invention , " director of exhibitions Mark Snyder told The Huffington Post in an email . " However , when looking at literary and visual representations of sex acts , there is very little territory that has not already been explored . "  Old Man of Twenty-Five , 1855 Guide to the Harem or Directory to the Ladies of Fashion in New-York and Various Other Cities for 1855 . Ink on Paper Gillen and Co . Museum of Sex Collection .  Early erotic materials include lithographs of sex acts and the above brothel guide , a sort of menu of sexual offerings at various establishments . Early photographs depict uninhibited sexual encounters . " Throughout history , " Snyder said , " every time there is a new invention or advancement in technology , it is , very shortly after , utilized for sex . "  Accordingly , by the turn of the 20th century , porn was beginning to look fairly modern . " Early pornographic sex films , known in the United States as ' blue films , ' ' smokers , ' or ' stags , ' began appearing almost as soon as motion pictures were invented , " explained Snyder . The oldest surviving American stag film , " A Free Ride , " It was made in 1915 .  " People have engaged in hardcore sex , and documented it , through all eras of history , " Snyder pointed out . " They made sex toys ; they had threesomes . " And like modern pornographers , they did n't always restrict themselves to specialized sex toys -- the woman in the above photo is making a candle serve as a dildo .  Items in the exhibit show same-sex encounters , blow jobs , and what we might consider BDSM today , as in this photo of a nude couple cavorting with a scary-looking whip :  While the advent of widespread adult video stories and , to an exponentially greater degree , free Internet porn has led to an explosion in access to hardcore erotica , the materials themselves are n't quite as groundbreaking as we may assume . " Many tropes that we associate with modern pornography were actually created much earlier , " explained Snyder . " The ' money shot , ' for example , was actually established during the Victorian Era . "  Mind  Throughout the nation 's history , a tenuous divide between pornography and art has been enforced . Even museums , Snyder noted , often " sequestered sexually-related artifacts away from the rest of their collection . "  The distance of many years , however , allows us to look at these titillating images and videos with something other than arousal -- the sepia-washed tones and dated hairstyles clash with our modern ideas of pornography and obscenity . Reframed by their antiquity , these vintage sexual poses take on an innocence , an artistic perspective on universal human needs .  " Hardcore " is n't just a glimpse into our often forgotten history of graphic porn , but a reminder of how beautiful and powerful sex can be , in all its many forms .  See more images from the exhibit below , and check out the full show at the Museum of Sex . " Hardcore " runs through 2016.
