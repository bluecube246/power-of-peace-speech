but this baseball postseason , a star has emerged , and it 's one who most would have loved to see fall flat on his face . alex rodriguez joined fox sports for their postseason coverage and generally has received high marks for his work in the studio during the alcs and world series . ( with the exception of accidentally saying yankees when he was discussing the mets during the post-game show on wednesday night ) .  rodriguez 's knowledge of the game has never been in question : he is known as one of the best players at breaking down the intricacies of the game . that , of course , has been overshadowed by his steroid-tainted past , which has made him a pariah outside of the bronx .  but his on-air success this postseason has added to the possibility he finds a future in broadcasting after he retires , if that is the direction he opts to go .  " alex is someone we 've always felt has potential to be an outstanding television analyst , if he chose to field with the way he sees the game and looks at the game , it 's really a unique combination , " said fox 's executive producer john entz during a conference call before the world series .  " after spending the week with him , i have to say he 's been even more impressive than we could have possibly hoped . he really cares about doing this the right way , and he 's truly been an incredible asset to the show . he actually tells me he 's enjoying it , which is probably the most surprising part . it 's been nothing but positive across the board , so it has been a great experience . "  do you like a-rod the analyst ?  since i like a-rod the baseball player , a-rod the yankee , i definitely like a-rod the analyst . all those who want to keep hating him for something he 's already paid for , go ahead . just tell me one thing ... what 's it like to be perfect ?
