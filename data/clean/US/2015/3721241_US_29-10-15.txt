<p> But this baseball postseason , a star has emerged , and it 's one who most would have loved to see fall flat on his face . Alex Rodriguez joined Fox Sports for their postseason coverage and generally has received high marks for his work in the studio during the ALCS and World Series . ( With the exception of accidentally saying Yankees when he was discussing the Mets during the post-game show on Wednesday night ) . <p> Rodriguez 's knowledge of the game has never been in question : He is known as one of the best players at breaking down the intricacies of the game . That , of course , has been overshadowed by his steroid-tainted past , which has made him a pariah outside of The Bronx . <p> But his on-air success this postseason has added to the possibility he finds a future in broadcasting after he retires , if that is the direction he opts to go . <p> " Alex is someone we 've always felt has potential to be an outstanding television analyst , if he chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field with the way he sees the game and looks at the game , it 's really a unique combination , " said Fox 's executive producer John Entz during a conference call before the World Series . <p> " After spending the week with him , I have to say he 's been even more impressive than we could have possibly hoped . He really cares about doing this the right way , and he 's truly been an incredible asset to the show . He actually tells me he 's enjoying it , which is probably the most surprising part . It 's been nothing but positive across the board , so it has been a great experience . " <h> Do you like A-Rod the analyst ? <p> Since I like A-Rod the baseball player , A-Rod the Yankee , I definitely like A-Rod the Analyst . All those who want to keep hating him for something he 's already paid for , go ahead . Just tell me one thing ... what 's it like to be perfect ?
