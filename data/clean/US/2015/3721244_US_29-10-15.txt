Victoria Beckham : How Her Line of 10 Dresses Became a Fashion Empire  Victoria Beckham is a Woman of the Year because ... " She 's bold enough to curate a style all her own . She 's a loyal , giving friend -- and funny , funny , funny ! " -- actress Eva Longoria  Posh Perfectionist : " I always wanted to work in fashion ; it was always my passion , " says Beckham , 41 , photographed in the London office of the empire she created . Victoria Beckham dress . Manolo Blahnik pumps .  When I first met Victoria Beckham , two decades ago , the world had never heard of the Spice Girls . She and her bandmates stormed into my office at a U.K. TV network and gave a jaw-dropping rendition of " Wannabe . " Although not as bold as her Spice peers -- everyone else jumped up on the desks -- Victoria was the one who assured me they were going to make it . " We 're not going to stop till it happens course , a global phenomenon . And the world got to know Posh Spice , a camera-ready superstar who married an equally famous and sexy Brit , David Beckham ( they met after one of his soccer games ) . After the Spice Girls -- amicably -- went their separate ways , Beckham had a brief solo career but decided to devote most of her time to being a mom . Then in 2008 , after working with a sunglasses company and a denim brand ( and even modeling on a Milan runway ) , she made the bold decision to launch her own fashion line .  Just your average career change ? Hardly . The fashion world is not particularly kind to celebrities who decide they want to become designers . Beckham debuted her collection in the quietest , humblest way possible : in a small hotel room with intimate one-on-ones with the press , placing the emphasis on her clothes , not her celebrity . It was a smart , smart tactic . " We have met with many celebrities who aspire to get into fashion , but energy it takes , " says Jim Gold , president and chief merchandising officer of the Neiman Marcus Group . " Victoria was different . There are no shortcuts in this business , and she was willing to roll up her sleeves . " Her hard work and meticulous design have turned that first collection of 10 dresses into a fashion empire worth a reported $57 million . The silhouettes of her collections are so classic and flattering that just about every celeb in Hollywood -- from Oprah to Jennifer Lawrence -- has a VB dress in her closet . The label has won the respect of industry insiders too : She 's been awarded multiple British Fashion Awards , including two for brand of the year .  Beckham 's gift is to make clothes that women want to wear . " Women respond to her clothes because she lives a life that they understand , " says friend and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour . " She 's an incredibly busy woman , she 's the mother of four kids , she 's very much a partner to David , for women who are working , traveling , balancing , juggling all sorts of things at the same time . " She tries to teach her children , sons Brooklyn , Romeo , and Cruz and daughter Harper , some of what she 's learned : " Nothing ever came naturally to me , " she says . " I was never the cleverest , never best at anything . But we always tell our children that if you work hard and believe in yourself , you can do what you want . "  And she 's showing them that when you 're successful , you give back -- period . In 2014 Beckham became an international goodwill ambassador for UNAIDS and since then she has raised more than $4 million to benefit HIV and AIDS charities including AMFAR , the Elton John AIDS Foundation , and Mothers 2 Mothers . " Motherhood puts us all on one level , " she says . " I just felt this real pull to help . " She does n't simply lend her name or write a check : She 's visited by the disease . " Victoria 's helping us to reach those millions of people out there we can not reach , " says Michel Sidib ? , executive director of UNAIDS . " She 's a person of compassion , and she 's opening new doors . "  Fellow bandmate Melanie Brown ( a.k.a . Scary Spice ) is not surprised in the least by her friend 's successes . " She 's broken the mold , " she says . " And she 's the funniest , naughtiest , dirtiest pal to sit next to at dinner . " ( Admits Beckham : " I like to ring the tequila bell . " )  Indeed , when I see Beckham these days , what strikes me is the newfound ease with which she juggles her many roles . But her mission , she says , has never really changed : " I did have to find myself and my confidence . And I want to make other women feel like the best version of themselves . That 's the same message as the Spice Girls . It LIVE BY : " Work hard , stay focused , be appreciative , and really , really go for it . I was told I could n't do lots of things , so if I can do it , you can . "
