At Toronto, a Lack of Consensus Points to a Fascinating Oscar Season

at toronto , a lack of consensus points to a fascinating oscar season ahead  rumor has it that there may be a clear front-runner for which film will walk home with the festival 's people 's choice award , a populist prize that points to the fest 's most beloved film -- and , more often than not , the one that will go on to earn a best-picture oscar nomination . but if audiences at toronto are rallying around a single festival favorite , they have n't shared that knowledge with the critics .  instead , the buzz at toronto -- a festival where awards-season buzz usually seems shot out of a cannon in every direction -- has been a bit more scattershot , with some affection for johnny depp in black mass in one corner , some passionate supporters of beasts of no nation or anomalisa in another , and a lot of people very excited about spotlight , who still ca n't help but wonder if it 's too straightforward and smart for general audiences . at a dinner with other critics a five-star , **26;44;toolong masterpiece -- a 12 years a slave or even black swan , the kind of thing you go to bat for when your critic 's group votes on their own awards at the end of the year .  so without a single film that audiences and critics alike will rally around out of toronto , it may be the individual performances that get the biggest lift out of this year 's event . already the leading actor and actress races are looking ungodly crowded : safe early bets like depp , matt damon ( the martian ) , idris elba ( beasts of no nation ) , and brie larson ( room ) were warmly received , while some surprises emerged , like alicia vikander 's commanding lead role in the danish girl , helen mirren 's salty portrayal of hedda hopper in trumbo , or sandra bullock 's engaging blend of comedy and tough dramatics in our brand is crisis . but all of those films and actors were , on some level , already on the hollywood radar ; so far there 's nothing moore seemingly out of nowhere into the best-actress race ( and , eventually , a win ) .  there are many , many promising movies left to come in the fall , and a few -- todd haynes'scarol chief among them -- that have already screened at other festivals but skipped toronto . and the lack of a consensus favorite at toronto likely points to a more interesting awards season ahead , avoiding a situation where something like 12 years a slave or the artist marches steadily from a splashy toronto premiere to a seemingly inevitably best-picture win . for the first time in a few years , the awards race still seems fairly open even with toronto 's premieres wrapping up . that uncertainty is uncomfortable for pushy oscar pundits who wants to know everything first . . . but could make the next few months more fun for everyone else .
