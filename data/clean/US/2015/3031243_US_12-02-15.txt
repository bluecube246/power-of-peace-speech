Twitter may increase the amount of ad content in user streams in 2015 , the New York Times reports . During a keynote address at a tech investors conference in San Francisco yesterday , Twitter CEO Dick Costolo addressed the company 's revenue expansion plans , which include growing its core business model of inserting ads into Twitter streams .  Costolo said the company has discussed increasing the ad load to about 5 percent of the content you view on Twitter , which would work out to roughly one ad every 20 tweets . " That may not be exactly where it lands , but you can think about it as eventually being in that range , " Costolo said . " We 're well below that now , so we 've got tons of room to grow there . " Notably , Facebook also aims for about 5 percent of its posts to be ads . Twitter 's current ratio , based on an unscientific count , appears to be around one ad for every 25 to 30 non-ads .  Last month the company compete with Facebook and increase the amount of time users spend on the service . " Content creators want to go into an ecosystem , deliver a great experience to users and tell stories , and then make money from it , " Costolo said .  Twitter posted its fourth quarter earnings last week . While the company 's quarterly revenue grew 97 percent year over year , its user growth has stalled , increasing less than 2 percent from the last quarter . Twitter will need to work on catering to the needs of its user base -- like a way to deal with harassment -- if it wants more people to see its ads .  Correction , 3 p.m. : This post has been updated to clarify and add context to Costolo 's remarks . An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Costolo wanted users to see an ad every 20 tweets .  Forgot username ?
