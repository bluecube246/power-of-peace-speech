<p> Alcohol , obesity , lack of exercise and poor diets have all been shown to increase the risk of cancer -- but few Americans realize this , according to a new survey published Wednesday to mark World Cancer Day . <p> Instead , people tend to blame risk factors for cancer on food additives , genetically modified foods , stress and beef hormones . Falsely identifying risk factors means many American do not know there are lifestyle changes they can make to help lower the possibility that they might get cancer . <p> The Cancer Risk Awareness Survey , released Wednesday by the American Institute for Cancer Research , has been conducted periodically since 2001 , asking participants to select factors that they believe have a significant effect on whether the average person develops cancer . <p> " Instead of focusing on factors that you ca n't always control , we want Americans to learn more about the factors that you can and do control , every day , " Alice Bender , the organization 's associate director of nutrition programs , said in a statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the myth that there is nothing they can do to change their risk of getting cancer . The reality is that genes and family history account for 5 percent to 10 percent of all cancers , a reality that 21 percent of Americans know . <p> Among the results showed that fewer than half of Americans know some of the real risks of cancer : <p> Research has found that diets that are high in fruits and vegetables lower the incidence of colon , stomach and pancreatic cancer . The survey found , however , that only 42 percent of Americans are aware that a diet without these components can increase cancer risk -- a figure that has decreased since 2009 , when the total was at 52 percent . <p> Diets high in red meat have been linked to colon cancer , a reality that just over a third of Americans know . This reflects the same percentage of people that were aware of this in 2013 , the last time the survey was conducted . <p> Alcohol also has been shown to increase cancer risk , particularly for breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this has increased 5 percentage points since 2013 , the total still remains at less than half , at 43 percent . <p> The knowledge that being overweight or obese impacts cancer risk has increased by 4 percentage points -- to 52 percent . <p> Other factors that Americans think impact cancer risks are those that research has yet to show conclusive evidence : <p> Pesticide residue on produce ( identified by 74 percent of respondents ) . Though evidence has linked cancer with high daily exposure of farm workers to pesticides , the evidence on lower levels of exposure is not clear . <p> Food additives ( 62 percent ) <p> Genetically modified foods ( 56 percent ) <p> Stress ( 55 percent ) <p> Hormones in beef ( 55 percent ) <p> Bender concluded in a statement that Americans often are hit with individual studies of risk factors , not seeing the overall scientific consensus . " When it comes to cancer , there are no guarantees , " she said in the statement . " But the science on lowering cancer risk has never been clearer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released Wednesday , estimated that a third of the most common cancers in the U.S. could be prevented if Americans moved more , weighed less and ate more healthfully . This number represents 340,000 cases , according to the organization . <p> In addition , if Americans avoided the sun more , then nearly half of cancers in the country would be prevented , according to the research group . <p> Kimberly Leonard is a health care reporter for the News division at U.S. News .
