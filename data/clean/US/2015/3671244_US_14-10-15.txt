<h> Ask Congress <p> A forthcoming report by the congressional U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission provides new details of China 's space-weapons programs , dubbed counterspace arms , that are aimed at destroying or jamming U.S. satellites and limiting American combat operations around the world . <p> Two direct-ascent missiles capable of hitting satellites in both lower and higher orbits are under development , the SC-19 and the DN-2 . Anti-satellite missile tests were carried out as recently as last year . <p> The high-orbit DN-2 can hit U.S. Global Positioning Satellites but appears more suited for blowing up U.S. intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance satellites . The DN-2 could be deployed in five to 10 years . <p> " These systems consist of a satellite armed with a weapon such as an explosive charge , fragmentation device , kinetic energy weapon , laser , radio frequency weapon , jammer or robotic arm , " the report says . <p> The co-orbital arms maneuver in space close to satellite targets and then deploy weapons to disable or destroy them . They also can crash into satellites or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Chinese miniature imaging satellite passed within 28 miles of the International Space Station with no notification , in what the report said was a simulated co-orbital anti-satellite attack . <p> The commission report , to be publicly released next month , says China 's People 's Liberation Army believes demonstrating capabilities that can damage or destroy satellites is important to deterring adversaries , and that the anti-satellite threat is a more credible deterrent than nuclear arms . <p> " The PLA assesses U.S. satellites are critical to the United States ' ability to sustain combat operations globally , " the report says . " PLA analysis of U.S. military operations states that ' destroying or capturing satellites and other sensors will deprive an opponent of initiative on the battlefield and make it difficult for them to bring their precision-guided weapons into full play . ' " <p> The PLA estimates 50 U.S. surveillance satellites , along with drones and manned aircraft , provided 70 percent of battlefield communications in the 1990s operations in Kosovo . <p> China is also planning military cyberattacks that can take control of satellites by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military researchers have written that during a conflict , the PLA will " attempt to conduct computer network attacks against U.S. satellites and ground-based facilities that interact with U.S. satellites , " the report says . <p> " If executed successfully , such attacks could significantly threaten U.S. information superiority , particularly if they are conducted against satellites with sensitive military and intelligence functions , " the report says . " For example , access to a satellite 's controls could allow an attacker to damage or destroy the satellite ; deny , degrade , or manipulate its transmissions ; or access its capabilities or the information , such as imagery , that can be gained through its sensors . " <p> The report said Chinese hackers probably were behind several computer attacks against U.S. space assets , including a September 2014 hack of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration satellite and weather service systems . <p> China also has acquired a number of electronic ground-based jammers for use against satellites , and in 2006 China fired a high-powered laser that temporarily disrupted a U.S. satellite , the report said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A nuclear detonation in low-earth orbit would create a damaging electromagnetic pulse that could disrupt unshielded satellites . <p> A copy of the draft report was obtained by Inside the Ring and is the latest publicly available draft . The final report will be released next month . <p> New Russian cruise missile operational <p> Russia conducted a flight test of it newest long-range cruise missile on Sept. 11 , a month before firing the missiles from the Caspian Sea into Syria as part of Moscow 's campaign in support of President Bashar Assad 's regime . <p> The Sept. 11 flight test of an SSN-30A missile , known by NATO as Kalibr , demonstrated capabilities similar to the U.S. Navy 's Tomahawk cruise missile . The Kalibr test missile traveled some 2,000 kilometers , according to defense officials familiar with the test , or about 1,200 miles . <p> The missile was tested earlier in August when U.S. officials said it was nearing deployment . The new missile is regarded as a major threat and can be armed with either nuclear or conventional warheads . <p> Less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 fired 26 Kalibr missiles against Syrian rebel bases in northern and eastern parts of the country . Four of the missiles reportedly malfunctioned and landed in Iran . <p> But the 22 other missiles struck what Moscow said were 11 targets in Syria traveled over 1,000 miles , and traversed through both Iraqi and Iranian airspace , showcasing a new long-range strike capability by the Russian military . <p> Under President Vladimir Putin , Moscow is engaged in a major military buildup of mainly new nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems . <p> The first use of the Kalibr in combat operations has prompted NATO military intelligence analysts to upgrade its status to " deployed . " <p> There are concerns within the alliance Russia is using the missile strikes on Syria as a not-so-subtle message to NATO that it could also use the missile against Eastern European targets , including members of the Western alliance . <p> Russian officials have issued veiled threats over NATO 's plans to bolster military forces in the east , specifically Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government cyberattacks on U.S. information systems as having the effect of " robbing us blind . " <p> Northcom commander Adm . William Gortney said in remarks to the Atlantic Council he does not expect the recent agreement reached between President Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to work . China 's industry is heavily dependent on Chinese cyber economic espionage , he said . <p> Asked if the informal U.S.-China agreement banning cyber economic espionage will work , the admiral replied : " They 're going to have to show me that they 're going to stop . I just do n't see that happening . " <p> The report lists nine major cyberattacks originating from China , including the case of six U.S. companies involved in nuclear power , metals and solar power that led to the indictment of five PLA officers , and a U.S. Postal Service cyberattack in November 2014 that compromised Social Security numbers of 800,000 postal workers . <p> Other Chinese cyberattacks involved the Anthem health care attack where hackers pilfered medical records on 80 million customers ; cyber attacks in April on U.S. websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the Office of Personnel Management attack that stole sensitive data on some 22 million federal workers .
