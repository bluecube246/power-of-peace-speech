<h> University of South Carolina , Boeing are research partners <p> COLUMBIA , S.C . ( AP ) -- Boeing and the University of South Carolina have announced a long-term research agreement that its leaders said will produce new and innovative technologies for the aerospace industry as well as the engineers to foster them . <p> University President Harris Pastides and Boeing Chief Technology Officer John Tracy made the announcement Thursday at the school 's McNair Center for aerospace research in Columbia . <p> Boeing , which is the world 's largest aerospace company , is expected to invest up to $5 million over the life of the agreement . The money should pay for up to two dozen research projects that are expected to improve Boeing 's products , the officials said . <p> The projects will focus on such things as new ways to use carbon fiber composite materials , finding improved techniques for fusing aircraft parts , and improving the efficiency of structures through automated manufacturing . <p> Boeing is the world 's largest aerospace firm . Its workers assemble the company 's 787 Dreamliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,000 people are employed at the complex . It also opened a research center in North Charleston that focuses on composite fuselage and propulsion production . <p> The McNair Center is named in honor of the late space shuttle Challenger astronaut Ronald McNair , a South Carolina native killed in the 1986 explosion of the spacecraft . Nearly 30 USC faculty members contribute to research projects at the center . <p> " This partnership with Boeing puts the University of South Carolina on the forefront of research that will lead to exciting new discoveries in the aerospace field , " Pastides said in remarks prepared for the event . <p> Pastides said he thinks the partnership will help transform South Carolina 's economy . <p> " Together with Boeing , the McNair Center will work not only to innovate , but also educate future aerospace engineers and makes South Carolina a choice destination for the aerospace industry , " the president said . <p> Tracy said Boeing hopes the partnership " will help ensure Boeing can incorporate innovative technologies that will make our products even more capable , our workplaces even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University officials said the McNair Center includes a production-level automated fiber placement machine , which allows for the testing of new materials and designs for industry partners . Last year , the center announced a multiyear research contract with the Dutch-based Fokker Technologies .
