Inventor of Eco-Friendly Battery Wins Prestigious Prize  On a mission to change the way the world uses energy , Jay Whitacre is the latest recipient of the prestigious $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize , which honors remarkable mid-career inventors who have also demonstrated a commitment to mentorship in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) .  Whitacre was recognized for inventing a low-cost , eco-friendly battery , called the Aqueous Hybrid Ion battery , which stores massive amounts of energy at a low cost per joule .  The rechargeable battery -- made from water and inexpensive resources like sodium and carbon -- stores excess energy generated by renewable sources such solar and wind systems , so that the energy can be used later when the sun is n't shining or the wind is n't blowing .  This kind of storage can make renewable energy more reliable and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels .  Whitacre is a materials scientist and professor at Carnegie Mellon University 's College of Engineering . He is also the founder of Aquion Energy , a startup to donate a significant portion of his Lemelson-MIT Prize money toward creating a fellowship to support graduate students interested in innovative energy solutions .  " Jay is passionate about sharing his experiences with young people , and is intent on inspiring them to cultivate an interest in STEM and invention , " Joshua Schuler , executive director of the Lemelson-MIT Program , said in a press release .  Whitacre will be honored in person on Nov. 2 at EmTech MIT , an annual conference on emerging technologies hosted by " Technology Review " at the MIT Media Lab.
