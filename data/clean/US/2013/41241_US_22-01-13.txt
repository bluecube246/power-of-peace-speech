<h> Published byStanford Medicine <p> Past studies show that maintaining strong social relationships can lower a person 's risk for certain health conditions . But researchers are still working to unravel the mystery about how having an active social life , or the lack of one , can influence physical health . <p> Findings from two related studies recently presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology offer new insights into how loneliness can weaken the immune system , increase sensitivity to physical pain and contribute to inflammation in the body . <p> One study looked at overweight but otherwise healthy middle-aged adults , while the second evaluated breast cancer survivors . In both studies , participants completed stress tests , provided blood samples and had their social lives evaluated using the UCLA Loneliness Scale . <p> The loneliest of the otherwise healthy participants had more markers of inflammation when tasked with a stressful activity , like speaking in front of others or doing math . <p> The lonelier breast cancer survivors , in addition to increased inflammation , experienced more pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tends to be triggered by stress , can also be used a measure of immune response . Here , those who scored higher for loneliness showed more signs of herpes reactivation . <p> Researchers say the results suggest that being lonely can cause people to experience daily life as more stressful , which may cause chronic stress and in turn disrupt the immune system . <p> The findings related to breast cancer survivors reminded me of research ( subscription required ) by Stanford psychiatrist David Spiegel , MD , on depression and survival rates among this group . Spiegel discussed his findings and the physiological connection between depression and breast cancer in this past Scope Q&amp;A.
