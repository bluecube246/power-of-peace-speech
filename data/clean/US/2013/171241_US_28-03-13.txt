<h> Worst Company In America Round 2 : Bank Of America Vs . Chase <p> March 28 , 2013 <p> It 's time for Banker Battle 2013 , as these two Wall Street Warriors take a break from trading toxic securities in order to trade some deadly blows to the head . <p> After two consecutive failed shots at the WCIA title , will Bank of America finally take home a Golden Poo to match the two second-place silver turds we assume grace the BofA corporate trophy case alongside an inter-bank softball league Certificate of Participation ? <p> If so , BofA will have to get through a whale of a competitor in Chase ( or JPMorgan Chase if you 're not into the whole brevity thing ) , and it will probably need a better showing than its **25;0;TOOLONG victory over Capital One in the first round .
