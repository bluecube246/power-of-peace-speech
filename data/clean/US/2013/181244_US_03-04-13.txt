Why did 28,000 rivers in China suddenly disappear ?  For years , China claimed to hold an estimated 50,000 rivers within its borders . Now , more than half of them have abruptly vanished .  Last week , China 's Ministry of Water Resources announced the results of a three-year survey of the country 's waterways , revealing startling declines in water supply . According to the census , there were 22,909 rivers in China as of 2011 , each covering an area of at least 100 square kilometers . That marks a decrease of about 28,000 from the government 's previous estimates , raising fears among environmentalists and putting Beijing on the defensive .  China 's longest rivers , the Yangtze and the Yellow , have each seen decliningwater levels in recent years , but the government 's survey -- its most comprehensive to date -- may shed new light on the breadth and gravity of the country 's crisis .  According to the South China Morning Post , officials attributed the decline to global warming and outdated mapping techniques , saying 1950s . Experts , meanwhile , say there are more direct factors at play -- namely , explosive economic development and poor environmental stewardship .  Ma Jun , director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs , acknowledges that updated mapping techniques could explain some discrepancies in river estimates , though he notes that the government 's findings corroborate those from independent studies .  " pollution is destroying the limited resources we have "  " Our research has shown that in some areas , especially in north China , rivers are drying up or turning into seasonal rivers , " Ma said in a phone interview with The Verge . There are several explanations for this phenomenon , including deforestation and , to a less certain extent , climate change , though Ma says the two primary catalysts are pollution and overpopulation .  Together , they form a potentially disastrous combination . China 's mushrooming population has added extra strain to its limited water supply , while the country 's rampant industrialization has left many rivers contaminated .  The extent of China 's pollution when more than 12,000 dumped pig carcasses washed ashore in Shanghai and Jiaxing . Agricultural and industrial waste has had a pronounced human impact , as well , contaminating water supplies in so-called " cancer villages " -- a moniker for areas with particularly high cancer rates .  Dead pigs and cancer villages  These incidents have drawn greater attention to China 's water crisis , while reviving concerns over the environmental costs of unfettered economic development . Chinese lawmakers , however , have been grappling with these issues for decades .  China 's modern water management system dates back to the 1960s , when a series of devastating floods forced Mao Zedong to commission an array of dams , reservoirs , and spillways . Mao 's infrastructure helped prevent floods , but it also created ecological imbalances by blocking rivers that once flowed into the North China Plain . As a result , lakes and rivers in the region began drying up , and farmers began depleting well supplies .  Population growth has only compounded China 's supply issues . According to a 2006 study from the China 's water use has increased more than fivefold since 1949 , forcing the government to take even more drastic measures .  In 2008 , China unveiled the Three Gorges Dam -- a massive hydropower project that the country heralded as a marvel of engineering . Today , it 's the largest hydropower structure in the world , though it has had disastrous ecological and social effects , resulting in deadly landslides and the displacement of an estimated 1.4 million people .  The government openly acknowledged these pitfalls in 2011 , but it remains intent on building the South-North Water Transfer Project -- an even grander undertaking that the New York Times described as " China 's most ambitious attempt to subjugate nature . " When completed , the $62 billion initiative will divert water from China 's already drought-ravaged southern region to the northern Yellow and Hai rivers .  " An emergency relief effort "  Ma describes the Water Transfer Project as " an emergency relief effort , " citing the dire situation in China 's northeast region , though he does n't see it as out of water without this project , " he said , " but even the current volume of redirected water likely wo n't be enough to keep up with demand . "  Instead , Ma and others say China should focus on controlling demand and regulating pollution , rather than re-allocating its water supply .  Xavier Leflaive , head of the water team at the OECD 's Environment Directorate , says China should implement market-based reforms to encourage more responsible water usage , while phasing out fertilizer subsidies to mitigate agricultural runoff .  He acknowledges that China is n't the only country facing these issues ; global water demand is expected to increase 55 percent over the next three decades , and rapidly developing countries like India have faced similar crises . But Beijing 's unique economic and social developments add an extra layer of urgency . " This global trend is exacerbated in China by the speed and scale of urbanization and economic development , and by a lack of strong monitoring , inspection and enforcement capabilities , " Leflaive said in an email to The Verge sound policies , laws and regulations . "  China has implemented tougher regulations on water usage and pollutants -- the so-called " three red lines " -- though it remains to be seen whether they can be enforced across an expansive , and fast-growing economy .  " punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist "  The good news is that the Chinese government seems willing to take a harder stance on environmental stewardship . In the past , Beijing has scoffed at calls to control its greenhouse emissions , arguing that it should n't be punished for its own economic prosperity . But Premier Li Keqiang has adopted a more environmentally conscious tone in recent weeks , vowing to be more transparent about his country 's ecological issues .  " We must take the steps in advance , " Li said last month , " rather than hurry to handle these issues when they have caused a disturbance in society . "  The premier has also promised to enforce current regulations on pollution , as he explained at his debut show even greater resolve and take more vigorous efforts to clean up such pollution , " Li said . " We need to face the situation and punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist . "  Forgot username ?
