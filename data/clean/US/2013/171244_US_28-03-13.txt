" ( Yes , we noticed that his guitar is plugged in . ) <p> Shawn Brackbill/Corbis <p> We get a lot of mail at NPR Music , and amid the Penzey 's spice catalogs we will never open is a slew of smart questions about how music fits into our lives -- and , this week , why " unplugged " versions of songs are so often preferable to their more fussed-over studio counterparts . <p> Phil Kingston writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-released acoustic version of the Steve McQueen album , and it sounds better than the original . Which prompts the question : Why do unplugged recordings work ? Did the first production choices not get it right ? Why does stripping down a song make it feel more authentic , deeper , etc. ? " <p> For starters , you use an important word in your question : " authentic . " As music listeners , we 've all got a few cynical synapses that fire when we sense we 're being tricked -- think , especially recently , of the goosing of vocals via Auto-Tune . No matter how much we know about the process by which a record was made , it 's easy to shrug off a song 's sound when we can hear the sweeteners and the heavy hands of studio Frankensteins well-versed in turning marginal talents into slick superstars . <p> When Adele strolled in to the NPR Music offices a few years ago to perform a three-song Tiny Desk Concert on the eve of 21 's release , her band did n't exactly play " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice rang out without amplification . No filters , no microphone , no AutoTune , no way to mistake her for anything but the powerhouse captured on her records . Every inflection , every emotion rang out without assistance ; everyone I talked to afterward was like , " No Auto-Tune there ! " <p> Credit : NPR <p> Truly " unplugged , " unamplified performances serve the same purpose . They strip away what we see as smoke and mirrors to reveal a lot of essences -- the essence of a voice , the essence of a melody , the essence of a song 's sturdiness and versatility -- while also applying a veneer of timelessness . <p> Production techniques come and go , from the electric pianos and saxophones of so much ' 80s music to the overtly employed sweeteners that have turned up in a lot of pop music in the past decade . Love those techniques or hate them , they tend to cement a song 's place in a very specific era of popular music -- which is why , when Bon Iver dressed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 80s signifiers , so many fans recoiled . Our brains move on from outdated sounds in ways that make them seem jarring when we revisit records years and especially decades later . <p> YouTube <p> When bands unplug -- particularly when everything is boiled down to a voice and a guitar -- those performances are rendered largely immune to obsolescence . Johnny Cash 's voice-and-guitar masterpiece American Recordings followed a fallow period in which Cash released a string of sterile studio recordings , but when that first Rick Rubin-produced album came out in 1994 , it could have come from virtually any era . Cash 's weather-beaten voice obviously boomed out of a specific time in his life , and many of the songs were of recent vintage , but nothing else on American Recordings was tethered to any era . <p> YouTube <p> In music , as in many fields that lean on technology , today 's multidimensional state of the art is tomorrow 's tinny kitsch . By stripping down to the most elemental , time-tested building blocks -- a voice and a few strings , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modern . After all , by its very definition , timelessness includes today . <p> Got a music-related question you want answered ?
