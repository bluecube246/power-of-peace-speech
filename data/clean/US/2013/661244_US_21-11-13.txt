Who sent a bunch of hapless Russian soldiers of fortune to go do battle in Syria ?  By Michael WeissMichael Weiss is the editor in chief of the Interpreter , an online journal that translates and analyzes Russian media . Follow him on Twitter : @michaeldweiss .  November 21 , 2013  In late October , amendments were made to Article 208 of the Russian Criminal Code outlawing the " Organization of , or Participation in , Illegal Armed Units " in foreign countries . Intended to stanch the rising flow of radical jihadists from the Russian Federation to Syria , and purposefully written to encompass foreign military activities for which the participant need not receive payment , the amended law now carries a six-year prison sentence for anyone found guilty of violating it . According to Sergei Smirnov , the first deputy director of Russia 's Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , some 300 to 400 fighters , mainly from the North Caucasus , are thought to have already joined with religious crusaders in trying to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar , Article 359 , which dates back to 1996 , outlaws the more conventionally defined activity of the noncitizen mercenary -- as in the soldier of fortune who works for pay . Funnily enough , it 's that earlier statute that has already been broken by more than 200 Russians who just returned from a lackluster military performance in Syria . Only they were fighting for Damascus , not for al Qaeda .  In late October , international media outlets reported that Russian mercenaries appeared to have joined with Syrian army regulars in a fight against rebels . After a battle in Homs between regime troops and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham , one of the two main al Qaeda groups in Syria , the jihadi website Kavkaz Center -- known more for its crude propaganda than its empirically verifiable information -- claimed that among the 100 enemy slain were several Russians . One of the dead was even named : Aleksei Malyuta , from the city of Abinsk in Krasnodar territory . Kavkaz posted videos , including one reportedly showing a Russian mercenary breaking a piece of well as documents allegedly showing that Malyuta worked as a professional gun for hire for the Moran Security Group , a Moscow-based private military company , which had contracted a Hong Kong-registered entity called Slavonic Corps Ltd. to dispatch armed personnel to Syria . According to its website , Moran " offers targeted approaches in the world 's current hot spots , such as the Middle East , Central Asia and Africa , which include the enlistment of local experts in these dynamic and highly sensitive environments . " As for Slavonic Corps , on its website it claims to operate " in strict correspondence to Russian law " and " never takes part in events related to overthrow of governments , violating human rights of civilian population and in any other actions violating International Law and Conventions . " If one judges from some of the now-verified photographs that Kavkaz Center produced , these contracted " local experts " in Syria may have included the thuggish pro-regime shabiha , whose white trucks with mounted machine guns have become symbols of atrocity .  The story idled for several days until executives of Moran and Slavonic Corps . Alexey Badikov , a director of Moran , whose signature appeared on Malyuta 's personnel ID , which was obtained by jihadists in Syria , told Fontanka reporterDenis Korotkov that Malyuta did indeed work for Moran in 2012 and early 2013 and participated in seagoing operations to protect private merchant ships from piracy , though he did n't specify where . However , Badikov said , Slavonic Corps had no relationship with Moran , and Moran had n't contracted any work in Syria .  Fontanka proved that both assertions were false . It authenticated the ID documents published by the Kavkaz Center , proving that Malyuta did indeed have a contract with Slavonic Corps and was in Syria in October . But Malyuta , the newspaper found , was actually still quite alive and now back in Russia , celebrating his return with his brother , Sergei , who was the acting head of the same security detail in Syria , nine days after jihadists prematurely announced Aleksei Malyuta 's demise . Sergei Malyuta toldFontanka that Slavonic Corps contracted the Russian mercenaries , the " guard and defense of economic facilities of the Syrian Republic . The point was to free the subdivisions of the Syrian army from these duties , so that they could take part in the battle against the bandits . " Sergei Malyuta denied taking part in any clashes with jihadists or other rebels ; his brother 's documents , he said , were " simply stolen " out of an unattended backpack . As proof of life , Aleksei Malyuta sent Fontanka a video , taken in Russia , in which he was drinking and toasting to his good health . Fontanka further verified that all the mercenaries had returned safely but prematurely owing to the " failure of the hosts to fulfill their financial obligations , which caused problems with the housing and feeding of the fighters from Slavonic Corps . " The contract , apparently , had been broken .  But the story did n't end there . In a follow-up article published on Nov. 14 , Fontanka revealed that Russia 's domestic security service , the FSB , had arrested two high-ranking members of Slavonic the criminal code 's old Article 359 . Moreover , since the spring of 2013 , Fontana 's Korotkov found , based on interviews with several ex-contractors , Slavonic Corps had been recruiting former soldiers with combat experience to guard " energy facilities " in exotic locales for the promise of $4,000 per month . Recruits were interviewed over the phone before meeting directly with the president of Moran , Vyacheslav Kalashnikov , a lieutenant colonel in the FSB reserves , " who introduced himself as a general " and explained what the overseas missions would entail . A second face-to-face interview followed at the Baltic Shooting Center on Alexander Blok Street in St. Petersburg , where the appropriate forms would be completed and " passports ordered . " Finally , recruits were invited to Moscow , where they were told , in Moran 's offices , that they 'd be subcontracted to Syria with Slavonic Corps .  The men were called up just as soon as they arrived back in St. Petersburg . " Contracts with Hong Kong 's Slavonic Corps Limited were literally signed on knees on the According to Oleg Krinitsyn , the head of RSB-Group , Russia 's largest private military company , whom Fontanka interviewed , the Slavonic Corps team was a shambles from the start :  Among those guys , photographed against a backdrop of Syrian equipment , festooned with weapons , I noticed a few of our former employees who had been dismissed because of their poor moral character . I saw guys with criminal records amongst them . This once again confirms that the aim of the re cruiters was not to attract high-quality professionals , but just to plug a ' hole ' with cannon fodder , and fast . And the boys were sent on contracts that resembled contracts for suicide missions . Right away , people signed a contract that included a will to bury their remains in their homeland or , if that proved impossible , in the nation where they died , and then be reburied in Russia . Dreadful .  Moreover , Krinitsyn told the newspaper , the contract these mercenaries signed apparently had been commissioned not by any ministry in Damascus but by " " Mark Galeotti , a New York University professor who specializes in the Russian security services , concluded , following the Interpreter 's translation of the Fontanka exclusives , that " it is difficult to sustain any notion that at the very least the Russian government did not give this its blessing . "  As recounted by several of them to Fontanka , the mercenaries were flown to Beirut and then traveled by car to Damascus , before being transferred to a military base in the coastal province of Latakia . The Russians say they were greeted as foreign heroes by regime loyalists and housed in the makeshift barracks at the former stables of a horse track , alongside Syrian reservists . In October , according to one recruit , there were 267 Slavonic Corps mercenaries in Syria , split into two companies , one of them made up entirely of Cossacks , with the expectation that the total force would grow to 2,000 over time . They were given assault rifles , machine guns , and grenade launchers as well as other Soviet-era hardware , some of it 70 :  When they spoke to us in Russia , they explained that we were going on a contract with the Syrian government ; they convinced us that everything was legal and in order . Like , our government and the FSB were on board and involved in the project . When we arrived there , it turned out that we were sent as gladiators , under a contract with some Syrian or other , who may or may not have a relationship with the government .... That meant that we were the private army of a local kingpin . But there was no turning back . As they said , a return ticket costs money , and we 'll work it off , whether we like it or not .  The manager of the entire outfit in Latakia was Vadim Gusev , identified by Fontanka as deputy director of Moran . ( According to documents Foreign Policy obtained from Slavonic Corps ' registry , Gusev also owns all 10,000 shares of the Hong Kong-based company . )  The one and only actual campaign Slavonic 's mercenaries participated in control of oil fields in Syria 's eastern province of Deir ez-Zor . Portraits of Assad and Baathist flags were stuck to Hyundai buses and JMC trucks as the men set off on a 350-mile trek eastward from Latakia across rebel-infiltrated terrain . Signs that their safety was n't really a paramount concern of their hosts became apparent immediately . Battle-ready T-72 tanks were replaced by older , dilapidated T-62s before the mission began back in Latakia . A Syrian helicopter , evidently mistaking the Russian convoy for enemy action , got itself tangled in power lines and crashed on top of the entire mercenary column albeit , wondrously , without killing anyone . Then , on Oct. 18 , the Slavonic Corps fighters met their bathetic Little Bighorn after getting stuck in the town of al-Sukhnah , Homs , where they were surrounded by a contingent of up to 6,000 anti-Assad rebels ( a figure almost surely exaggerated ) . " Not wanting to die in vain for the ideals of the Syrian state , " Korotkov writes rather grandly , the Russians " jumped into their vehicles and began retreat , Alexei Malyuta 's bag was lost and fell into the hands of the regime 's opponents . " And from there his ecstatic obituary was uploaded to the Kavkaz Center .  Six mercenaries were wounded in the melee , two seriously . But the mercenaries credited their escape and survival to a sandstorm that they say blinded the advancing jihadists . The Russians returned first to an air base in Homs where they recalled " a loud argument ... between Vadim Gusev and the Syrian ' employer ' of the Slavonic Corps : It was clear that they had different views on the subsequent plan . Everybody heard their yells , including mentions of dollars and , more specifically , of $4 million , that would have to be worked off . " In the event , nothing was worked off , and all 267 Russians drove back to the base camp in Latakia neither expecting a hero 's welcome nor receiving one ; instead , they were now scorned by the same crowd that had cheered them days earlier . A risky but remunerative assignment that was the men were flown back to Moscow in the final days of October on two chartered planes . But as they filed off the planes at Moscow 's Vnukovo airport , all the men were taken into temporary custody by waiting FSB agents who confiscated their SIM cards , electronic media , and passports and began interrogating them individually . Gusev , the head of the mission , was arrested under Article 359 along with Evgeny Sidorov , Moran 's human resources head and a 20 percent owner of the company . Both men now face as many as eight years in prison for recruiting mercenaries .  Galeotti told the Interpreter that given Moran President Vyacheslav Kalashnikov 's background as an FSB reservist -- you never really " retire " from this status -- he and his private military company would have had " frequent and dense " contacts with the Russian security organs . " Someone within the government apparatus must have put/kept Syria on the list of countries where they are clear to work and processed their request , " he said . Andrei Soldatov , another expert The Restoration of Russia 's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB , agrees . " We can not exclude the possibility that Kalashnikov just used his contacts in the FSB to get some good contracts in Syria , " Soldatov said . " I mean , it might be not that the FSB exploited him but that he exploited the FSB . "  It 's not hard to surmise why the FSB would have turned on a company it may have given tacit support to send men into Syria . The mercenaries performed poorly in the field , and proof of their illicit activity had been plastered all over the Internet , so not tossing Gusev and Sidorov in the clink might have caused the kind of scandal that even an unembarrassable Kremlin would want to avoid . Moscow has been outspoken in its criticism of U.S. and Arab arms transfers to Syria 's rebels , even as its own state arms export company dispatches more and more sophisticated hardware to Assad , according to the State Department 's Robert Ford , the U.S. ambassador to Syria imperiled Geneva II peace conference takes place in December , just in time for the regime to be in a much- strengthened negotiating position after a series of tactical gains on the battlefield .  True , Russia has n't been shy about showing support for Assad even after the regime deployed chemical weapons on Aug. 21 ( something the Russian Foreign Ministry still denies ) . Reuters reported recently that second-tier Russian banks have been taking Syrian regime deposits , including barter accounts that would allow Damascus to import foodstuffs in exchange for oil or goods . Russian military technicians have also been in Syria to train and advise regime personnel on the use of Russian-sold air-defense systems . At least one " former " GRU ( Russian military intelligence ) officer took a bullet in the face while claiming to have been vacationing in the war zone and moonlighting as a correspondent with pro-regime Abkhazian Network News Agency . There were also rumors this past May that soldiers with the elite Zaslon ( " Screen " ) detachment of the Russian special forces were being sent to Syria , assault . But all this , as the Kremlin loves to point out , has been undertaken strictly in compliance with " international law " and with respect to Syria 's state sovereignty . But evidence of Russian citizens breaking Russian law to fight in Syria -- that 's something that hard-line Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would find hard to explain in one of his big-grinning , palm-slapping rap sessions with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry .  Complicating things even more for Russia is that Moran may have violated sanctions on Syria -- in the British Virgin Islands . While Moran is technically registered in breezy see-no-evil Belize , it is 50 percent owned by an entity called Neova Holdings Ltd. , which is registered in the Caribbean territory , a favored offshore corporate landing post for Russian enterprises trying to obfuscate their ownership structures . ( In fact , even Moran 's domain name is registered to Neova Holdings . ) The islands constitute a British overseas territory , and as such , they typically comply with British , U.N. , or E.U. sanctions regimes . Indeed , Services Commission announced that it was in full compliance with the European Union 's sanctions and arms embargo on Syria and would " give effect to an asset freeze in relation to persons responsible for the violent repression against the Syrian population in Syria , persons and entities benefiting from or supporting the Assad regime . " An attempt by Foreign Policyto reach the office of the British Virgin Islands ' premier for comment was unsuccessful . But regardless of what comes of the ongoing FSB investigation into Moran 's weekend-warrior work in Russia , its largest owner seems to have found itself on the wrong side of British Virgin Islands law .  Moran previously made international headlines way before its abbreviated adventurism in Homs . In October 2012 , one of its ships , the MV Myre Seadiver , was seized by the Nigerian Navy in Lagos , where it had docked temporarily to change crews en route from Madagascar to Conakry , Guinea . Fifteen Russian sailors on board , all of them comprising the new crew that had been replaced in port , were arrested . ( was not detained . ) Myre Seadiver , registered in the Cook Islands -- a territory legally bound to New Zealand -- but sailing under a Dutch flag , had a maritime registration certificate , dated June 2012 , authorizing the ship to " store , carry and embark/disembark arms &amp; ammunitions along with security teams . " It found was carrying 14 AK-47s , 22 Benelli MR1 rifles , and thousands of rounds of ammunition for both , according to the Nigerians , who said that the vessel had no prior authorization to dock in the country or transport weapons . Nigeria is a hub for global arms trafficking , given its chronic problems with Islamist insurgents , oil bandits , and pirates . It took until February 2013 for the sailors of Myre Seadiver to be granted bail -- which also came along with a $500,000 demand for the release of the ship -- and remanded to the custody of the Russian ambassador in Lagos . ( The sailors were returned to Russia this past October . ) Yet one veteran Russia watcher , John Helmer , who has fault in this affair .  Moran has also cropped up in an unflattering light in a recent report by C4ADS , a nonprofit security and analysis firm based in Washington , D.C. " The Odessa Network : Mapping Facilitators of Russian and Ukrainian Arms Transfers , " written by C4ADS senior analyst Tom Wallace and Chief Operating Officer Farley Mesko , notes that one of Moran 's clients is the German-owned Hansa Heavy Lift ( HHL ) , the rebranded incarnation of Beluga Shipping , a bankrupted company that was notorious for Russian and Ukrainian arms trafficking through Europe . " Two members of HHL 's four managing directors are Beluga veterans , " Wallace and Mesko write , " and a high percentage of HHL 's fleet is inherited from Beluga . Beluga was responsible for shipments of A.Q. Khan centrifuges to Libya , anti-tank missiles to Myanmar , and tanks to South Sudan . The exact nature of Moran 's relationship with HHL , or what kind of cargo they are hired to protect , is unknown . "  Illegally running Keystone Cossacks into Homs and contracting technology is n't exactly a winning corporate profile , even in Vladimir Putin 's Russia . But Moran 's humiliating moment at the hands of jihadists in Syria , now confirmed by the Russian media , comes at an especially sensitive time for Moscow , which has lately been trying to host a meeting between Assad regime officials and representatives of the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition in advance of Geneva II . " The Russian authorities are cracking down on these mercenaries because to not do so would compromise the image the Kremlin is trying to cultivate as a fair and neutral player in helping solve the Syria crisis , " said Donald Jensen , a former U.S. diplomat in Russia and now a resident fellow at Johns Hopkins University 's Center for Transatlantic Relations . " Russia wants to be the country all parties to the conflict have to turn to , rather than the United States . " A surefire way to scupper this self-appointed role as peace broker for a 19-month civil war that has killed 115,000 people and externally or internally displaced millions more is to get a shady private military company with ti es to Russian intelligence .
