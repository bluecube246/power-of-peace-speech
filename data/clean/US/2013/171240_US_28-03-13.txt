latest round of layoffs at t-mobile draws static  originally published march 28 , 2013 at 8:17 pm updated march 29 , 2013 at 6:15 am  t-mobile usa ended its silence around layoffs at its bellevue headquarters on thursday , as hundreds of employees lost their jobs .  between 200 and 300 employees in the company 's operations group were laid off , ranging from administrative assistants to senior vice presidents . that 's in addition to a layoff of 100 employees in the marketing department earlier this month .  while the cuts were not unexpected , employees said they received little communication from the company about the situation , with some taking issue with how the layoffs were carried out .  in a prepared statement , t-mobile noted that in new york on tuesday it announced a new business strategy aimed at reducing costs and complexity for consumers .  " as a result , we are making some operational changes to better align our business with our new strategy and position t-mobile for growth , " the statement said . " overall size of the business , and while we do n't take these actions lightly , these adjustments to how we invest in the business will enable us to better focus our resources as we implement this strategy . "  t-mobile is the nation 's fourth-largest wireless carrier and the largest wireless company still based in the seattle area , an area that spawned the modern wireless industry in the 1980s when mccaw cellular established a national network .  last year , t-mobile had about 4,800 employees at its bellevue headquarters and 36,000 nationally .  the layoffs come as t-mobile is preparing to go public after it merges with dallas-based metropcs in a deal that shareholders are voting on april 12 .  " they definitely are whittling down to the leanest organization they can survive with , " said michele clark , a seven-year veteran of the company , who was working as an executive assistant in the operations group when she was laid off thursday .  another affected employee said people had been anticipating the cuts in part because the human-resources group had reserved conference the list when she received an electronic calendar invitation to meet with a supervisor . the invitation came after the employee and others on the team worked over the weekend to prepare for the new service plans launched tuesday .  " you have a half an hour to do whatever you need to do then give your badge and leave , " the employee said . " i 've never dealt with anything so unprofessional . "  remaining employees are seeing other cost-cutting moves , from the loss of free beverages to the mysterious removal of office clocks . a person with knowledge of the situation said the clocks were removed because the t-mobile buildings ' centralized clock system was broken and the firm that built and serviced the system is out of business .  layoffs and uncertainty have prompted a number of t-mobile employees to pursue jobs at at&amp;t , which has had a large presence in the area since it acquired mccaw in 1994 . in redmond , at&amp;t manages operations in the western u.s. and performs engineering and testing . it has 4,592 employees in folks making inquiries here for some of our openings , " said fred devereux , president of at&amp;t 's west region . " we encourage it . "  t-mobile has n't been saying much internally about rumors over the past couple of weeks that layoffs were imminent , according to the employee who was laid off this morning :  " the only communication that we got about this was rumors , " the employee said .  meanwhile , the employee is fuming over handling of the layoffs and how it contrasts with the value and mission statements posted around headquarters in factoria .  " l look at the values that are printed on every poster on every wall -- ' go big , stay scrappy , ' ' integrity and respect guide our decisions , ' ' best place to perform and grow ' -- i just want to go around the building with a sharpie and go ' this one does n't apply , this one does n't apply , " the employee said .  brier dudley : 206-515-5687 or bdudley@seattletimes.com .  brier dudley brier dudley joined the editorial board after 14 years covering microsoft and the technology industry , including nine years writing a technology column on the business page . a third-generation seattleite , he received a bachelor 's degree in english from whitman college and studied film production in italy before starting a career in newspapers . he has won numerous journalism awards and several oyster-eating competitions .
