daily edition  the abcs of death : film review  directors of horror and suspense films " the innkeepers , " " v/h/s , " " down terrace " and " hobo with a shotgun " contribute to this anthology of 26 short films .  perhaps seeking to fill the void between installments of the vhs horror-compilation franchise after picking up the second installment s-vhs at sundance for release later this year , magnolia pictures is offering the abcs of death as a potential placeholder through its prolific magnet releasing genre label . stronger in concept than execution , this anthology of short films may initially draw theatrical audiences on the strength of the filmmakers ' credentials , although wider appeal is likely to be garnered with digital formats .  producers ant timpson and drafthouse films ' tim league hit on the idea of compiling 26 short films -- one for each letter of the alphabet -- into a feature-length program and showcasing directors from a variety of different countries with projects focusing on death as the central theme . some admirably recognizable talents v/h/s contributor adam wingard , down terrace and sightseers director ben wheatley , recent sundance breakout director jorge michel grau ( we are what we are ) , timo tjahjanto ( whose " safe haven " short was a disturbingly memorable contribution to the upcoming s-vhs ) and cult favorite yoshihiro nishimura of tokyo gore police .  running times vary from just a few minutes to as many as six or seven , forcing the filmmakers to significantly compress their often gruesome narratives . both the originality and quality of the shorts are equally variable , with the majority coming off as mere genre exercises rather than fully conceived films . leading off with the first letter of the roman alphabet , nacho vigalondo 's " apocalypse " is n't nearly as ominous as the title suggests , focusing on a housewife who bloodily dispatches her bedridden husband after unsuccessfully poisoning him for months , impatient for him to meet his demise .  with the possible exception of " dogfight , " marcel sarmiento 's gritty take on a cage fighter who battles a vicious dog barehanded , and iguchi , the series does n't really hit its stride until about halfway through , with tjahjanto 's " libido . " strapped down in heavy wooden chairs , two captive men are forced to pleasure themselves for a masked audience while watching various live sex acts , with the second-place finisher summarily and grotesquely executed . shot in an urgent , feverish style , the wan , desaturated color scheme sharply contrasts with the extremity of the men 's dire predicament .  " nuptials " from banjong pisanthanakun , the thai director of horror film shutter , injects some welcome humor into the grim proceedings . a young man presents his unimpressed girlfriend with a colorful parakeet as a gift , but when the bird voices her boyfriend 's wedding proposal and he proffers a ring , she interrupts her meal preparation to show her appreciation . the bird , however , has more to reveal , repeating a conversation that apparently took place between the man and his secret lover during a recent tryst , a disclosure that quickly enrages the knife-wielding girlfriend . pisanthanakun adopts a style amusing contrast to the rapidly escalating onscreen violence .  among the animated shorts , which include the bizarre " hydro-electric diffusion " and the trifling " klutz , " lee hardcastle 's claymation " toilet , " about a boy who 's afraid to use the commode lest it devour him , is the most successful , tapping into subconscious fears with a sly sense of humor . brit filmmaker wheatley 's " unearthed , " featuring a crazed mob chasing a vampire through the nighttime countryside from the undead 's point of view , begs for a longer treatment to play out the conflict between the victim and the aggressors .  before ultimately closing with the wildly irreverent horror spoof " zetsumetsu " from japanese director yoshihiro nishimura , xavier gens ' french film " xxl " is as impressive for its social commentary as the blood-soaked special effects . an obese woman makes her way home as she 's publicly ridiculed by passersby at almost every turn . arriving at her apartment , she immediately begins binging , indiscriminately consuming the contents of her copiously stocked refrigerator to her abundant flesh , she begins slicing away the fat even as she struggles to maintain consciousness with increasing blood loss . shooting in a realistic , unflinching style , gens capably portrays the woman 's desperation to adapt to a cultural norm with a sometimes unrealistic fixation on body image .  more erratic than consistently frightful , the abcs of death might have benefited from firmer curatorial guidance , but at least it 's laid the groundwork for developing a number of potentially effective feature-length films .
