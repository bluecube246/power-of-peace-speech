A sublime croissant at French Tart in Grant City , Staten Island .  French Tart chef Laurent Chavenet claims to work in the only authentic French cafe and restaurant in Staten Island . And he just might be right . Opened in 2009 , French Tart is one of those hidden gems that food lovers so often hear about in the outer boroughs , but so rarely find . Baked fresh every morning by Chavenet himself , the croissants are a work of art . The texture runs from crispy on the outside to soft and airy on the inside . According to Chavenet , the secret to making a great croissant is in quality ingredients , especially the butter , and the folding of the dough , which Chavenet demonstrates on a napkin . While the plain croissant is outstanding , the almond croissant is truly world-class . Moist , sweet and decadent , it 's more of a dessert than a breakfast item , but go ahead and dig in any time of day . After all , life is short . Eat dessert Colson Patisserie , in Park Slope , uses two types of flour in its croissants .  In 1986 , pastry chef Hubert Colson first opened his famed pastry shop in Mons , Belgium . Barely 20 years later , Yonatan Israel , a French filmmaker searching for structure and opportunity in life , opened his own shop as a tribute to his favorite pastry chef . And so the Park Slope outpost of Colson Patisserie was born . What a gift for pastry lovers in Brooklyn ! Colson 's croissants ( $2.45 ) seem light enough to float above the table and rich enough to melt in your mouth . Two types of flour are used in the dough , which is then folded six to eight times . Eighty croissants are made daily for the pastry shop , which is small but well-lit by a storefront of large windows . Sweet but not candied , these croissants taste like a big puff of flaky butter , which is just what every New Yorker needs to start off their day . As Israel says , " New York is the to change that . "  You ca n't talk about croissants in New York City without mentioning master pastry chef Laurent Dupal and his Spring St. shop Ceci-Cela . Since his quaint cafe opened in 1992 , Dupal has consistently made some of the flakiest , butteriest , airiest croissants ( $2 ) in the five boroughs . Dupal credits fresh ingredients , a controlled setting and years of experience for the excellent taste of his croissants , hundreds of which are sold a day in the patisserie . In fact , Dupal compares baking croissants with raising a child . " Everyone does it differently , " he says , " and , no matter what , you have to adjust to the temperament of the dough , which ca n't be too thin or too thick . " Take some home for the whole family . A pack of six frozen croissants costs $7 and can be baked at home .  YOUR TWO CENTS  The croissant at Chock Full o ' Nuts Cafe ( 1611 Avenue M , Brooklyn ) is very buttery inside and outside good with a side of butter/jelly along with a cup of regular or flavored coffee or chai latte or tea . Service is very courteous , but a little slow . -- Tzivia M.  Stork 's Bakery , located at 12-42 150th St. in Whitestone , makes the perfect croissant . Its golden , flaky , light crust is pleasing to the eye , and it draws you into its succulent flavor , which is light , rich and satisfying . Be sure to get there early in the a.m. if you wish to partake in this culinary delight . They sell out quickly . -- Carol D.  The best croissant in the city can be found at City Bakery ( 3 W. 18th St. in Manhattan ) . The pretzel croissant , as it 's called , combines the rich buttery body of a typical croissant with the salty crispness of a pretzel. -- Christopher O.  The croissants at The Standard hotel are the tastiest in the city . The secret is in the sourdough they add to it ! Also , buttery and flaky as all the upper West Side has the best croissant I 've had in NYC . It 's flaky on the outside , but buttery and perfectly doughy on the inside . It 's the best croissant I 've had outside of Paris . -- Colman C.  YOU SUGGEST IT , WE 'LL TEST IT  We 're in search of the best of the city , but we need your help .
