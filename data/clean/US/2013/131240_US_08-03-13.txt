<p> After more than a year of an ongoing standoff over her nomination to the federal bench in Nevada , Elissa Cadish withdrew her candidacy Friday morning . <p> " It is with regret that I write to inform you that I have requested that President Obama withdraw my nomination to this position , " Cadish wrote in a letter to Sen. Harry Reid , who had championed her candidacy but failed to pull Nevada Sen. Dean Heller on board . <p> Heller had objected to an opinion Cadish wrote about the individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment , several weeks before the Supreme Court settled the proper interpretation of its clauses in District of Columbia vs . Heller in 2008 . In response to inquiries , Cadish said she would uphold the Supreme Court 's interpretation as a federal judge . <p> Since President Barack Obama nominated Cadish in February 2012 , the number of vacancies has grown , such that three of Nevada 's seven seats on the federal bench are open . <p> Cadish cited a concern about that situation in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of Nevadans to get speedy justice , particularly in civil cases . " <p> The Sun wrote about the protracted judicial crisis in the state last month , just after Cadish passed her one-year anniversary of being nominated without having had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary committee . <p> That process was held up because Heller , citing his concern over Cadish 's previous Second Amendment position , would not sign the requisite " blue slip " needed to move Cadish 's nomination forward through the Senate process . <p> Heller said in a statement he supported Cadish 's decision to withdraw . <p> " This has been an unfortunate situation from the very beginning , and I wish Judge Cadish well in her future endeavors , " Heller said . " I look forward to working with Senator Reid so that we can avoid similar situations and move swiftly to confirm future nominees . " <p> In a statement , Reid spoke of his continued admiration for Cadish 's jurisprudential record , and expressed his frustration that the circumstances surrounding her nomination had reached such an impasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reid said . " However , I agree with Judge Cadish that with three vacancies on our district court , Nevada is in an urgent situation and continuing this impasse is not beneficial to our citizens who warrant a speedy judicial process . " <p> Reid added that he hoped he and Heller could move together to confirm other qualified nominees in the future . <p> Nevada currently has two other nominees pending before the Senate : Andrew Patrick Gordon , who is expected to receive a confirmation vote soon , and Jennifer A. Dorsey.
