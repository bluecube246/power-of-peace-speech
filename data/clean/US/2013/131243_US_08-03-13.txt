<p> This was a few summers ago at the annual Bughouse Square Debates , held by the Newberry Library in the small Washington Square Park across the street and celebrating the bygone era when that park was regularly filled with soapboxes , and atop them an assortment of orators and lunatics . <p> Of course , Durica was n't actually Reitman , the **27;85;TOOLONG of Emma Goldman , the **28;114;TOOLONG and frequent Bughouse Square presence . Reitman died in 1942 . But Durica was doing a fine job of bringing him back to life , in cape , floppy hat , scarflike Windsor tie and dashing manner . <p> Why , I wondered , would such a young man inhabit an all but forgotten character ? <p> " Growing up in Cleveland , I spent a lot of time with my grandparents , who lived on the same block , " he says . " They would regale me with stories of World War II and the Depression , and they had very detailed scrapbooks that made history come alive for me . " <p> Durica earned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Michigan and came to Chicago in 2005 as a doctoral candidate in the Department of English Language &amp; Literature at the University of Chicago . <p> In 2008 he founded Pocket Guide to Hell Tours ( pocketguidetohell.com ) , its name taken from a not-so-kind 19th century observation about Chicago by visiting British labor leader John Burns . <p> " As I was doing research for my dissertation ( about tramps , hobos and transients in American literature ) , I kept coming upon all of this good material that did n't fit into my academic work , " he says . " I wanted to share what I was learning with the broader public . " <p> His tours quickly morphed into more elaborate historical events . Among them have been re-enactments of the 1915 " Parade of Unemployment " and the 1886 Haymarket Riot ; a " Ben Hecht 's House Party , " celebrating the work of the famous **25;144;TOOLONG ; and a re-creation of the final episode of the early 1950s television program " Studs ' Place . " <p> His latest production is a bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the corrupt bosses ( i.e. aldermen ) of the 1st Ward , " Bathhouse " John Coughlin and Michael " Hinky Dink " Kenna . It takes place March 17 at the Hideout , 1354 W. Wabansia Ave. , starting at 8 p.m. , and admission is $10 , with all proceeds going to the 20-some performers . <p> I have more than a passing acquaintance with these fellows . My father , Herman , and his collaborator , Lloyd Wendt , wrote the definitive story of the lives and misdeeds of this duo in 1943 's " Lords of the Levee . " <p> " I use that book all the time , " says Durica . " It has great material about many things . " <p> Coughlin and Kenna conceived the First Ward Ball as a way of further stuffing their pockets , already bulging with graft , through imposed ticket and liquor sales . The first ball was held in 1896 , and by 1908 it attracted 20,000 drunken , yelling , brawling revelers to the Coliseum on South Wabash Avenue . The guests slopped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very messy . <p> " I am a bit too tall , but I will try to be suitably taciturn , " he says . <p> For a guy who has been dead since 1946 , Kenna is getting a lot of attention . His name surfaced in recent Mark Brown Sun-Times columns about efforts to close the Ewing Annex Hotel on South Clark Street , once owned by Kenna . And Friday , the Chicago History Museum put on display a " solid gold , diamond-studded alderman 's star " that belonged to Kenna . <p> But , of course , Durica knows all that . <p> In 2011-12 , Durica was a member of the Newberry 's first class of graduate scholars-in-residence . Daniel Greene , the library 's vice president of research and academic programs , says , " What really wowed me as I learned more about Paul 's work is his deep commitment to Chicago history and to communicating history to contemporary audiences in fun and engaging ways . " <p> That kind of says it all . But there is more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the recently released " Chicago by Day and Night : The Pleasure Seeker 's Guide to the Paris of America . " First published in 1893 , the book was intended for the hordes of tourists pouring into that year 's Columbian Exposition . The original text is great fun on its own , but Durica and Savage enrich the reading experience with a fine introduction and thoughtful , informative notes about such vanished places as the Eden Musee and Palmer Castle and the meaning of " dude town . " <p> When he presents his dissertation and gets his degree in June , Durica hopes to pursue a teaching and writing career , with the city 's history as its foundation and engine . <p> But April 14 , he and his pals will be dipping into the more recent past and bringing back to life " Bozo 's Circus " at The Hideout . There will be a Grand Prize Game and such beloved characters as Cooky , Wizzo and you know who.
