What in the world would compel a suspected criminal to return to the scene of the crime -- beyond a total lack of common sense ? In the case of one recent burglary , after a thief realized who he or she had been stealing from , an overwhelming sense of regret appeared to prompt a return of all of the victim 's stolen goods .  A center that offers help to sexual assault victims suffered a huge blow after a thief broke into the California facility , clipping wires to deactivate the alarm system and wreaking general havoc .  " Our office is really secure , " said the woman who runs the facility . " We have the best locks . But they still managed to find a way in . "  Whoever broke in made off with a load of computer equipment , and was long gone by the time the cops showed up . The woman who runs it explains to the Governor 's Office of Emergency Services that she overheard a police officer discussing what had happened with local " He was explaining what our facility does and the services we provide to the community . ... I left around 1:30 a.m. , " she said .  A mere few hour later , she got another call from the cops -- the burglar had come back , toting all of the computers that had been stolen earlier that night .  The burglar left a note , explaining the return of the items :  " We had no idea what we were takeing ( sic ) . Here your stuff back . We hope you guys can continue to make a difference in peoples lives . God Bless . "  The woman who runs the center thinks that the transients spread the word about what kind of work happened at the facility , somehow it got back to the burglar or burglars .
