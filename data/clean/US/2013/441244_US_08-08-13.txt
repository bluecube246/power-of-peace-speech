what in the world would compel a suspected criminal to return to the scene of the crime -- beyond a total lack of common sense ? in the case of one recent burglary , after a thief realized who he or she had been stealing from , an overwhelming sense of regret appeared to prompt a return of all of the victim 's stolen goods .  a center that offers help to sexual assault victims suffered a huge blow after a thief broke into the california facility , clipping wires to deactivate the alarm system and wreaking general havoc .  " our office is really secure , " said the woman who runs the facility . " we have the best locks . but they still managed to find a way in . "  whoever broke in made off with a load of computer equipment , and was long gone by the time the cops showed up . the woman who runs it explains to the governor 's office of emergency services that she overheard a police officer discussing what had happened with local " he was explaining what our facility does and the services we provide to the community . ... i left around 1:30 a.m. , " she said .  a mere few hour later , she got another call from the cops -- the burglar had come back , toting all of the computers that had been stolen earlier that night .  the burglar left a note , explaining the return of the items :  " we had no idea what we were takeing ( sic ) . here your stuff back . we hope you guys can continue to make a difference in peoples lives . god bless . "  the woman who runs the center thinks that the transients spread the word about what kind of work happened at the facility , somehow it got back to the burglar or burglars .
