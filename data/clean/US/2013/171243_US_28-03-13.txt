Inside the NBA's New Style Wars

<h> Inside the NBA 's New Style Wars <p> The rivalry among the NBA 's elite has spilled off the court and into an arena where athletes have historically feared to tread : high fashion . Players show up for games wearing leather pants , lensless glasses , and printed silk shirts -- and that 's just Russell Westbrook . GQ 's Steve Marsh spent a week trailing basketball 's biggest names -- Kevin Durant , Kobe , D-Wade , LeBron -- to find out how they 're turning the league into a runway for the world 's tallest peacocks <p> The moment Russell Westbrook steps off the bus in Denver for the Oklahoma City Thunder 's game against the Nuggets , you get the feeling that something insane is going to happen tonight . He 's wearing red leather motorcycle pants , a Superdry bomber jacket , black Doc Martens with the laces undone , and his trademark superfluous eyeglasses . A meager runway gallery awaits him -- just a few security guards , OKC 's team photographer , and me -- but he still disembarks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pinstriped spinnaker on draft night " to " pure line cut slim enough to make Beckham look like a slob , " Russ is a radical : His style is a punk provocation , a sartorial troll , and most crucially a full-on style , not just a series of outr ? outfits that no other player has the guts to wear . He 's swinging a leather Dopp kit with his right arm in a repetitive motion that could only be described as swag -- young , black , and Oi ! -- and generally looking like he 's striding out of Malcolm McLaren 's London SEX shop in 1976 . Every element of hiscostume is an extension of the identity he projects : part worldly NBA superstar , part suedehead hooligan . <p> A few hours later , in what NBA bloggers now refer to as " the queso incident , " Westbrook lives up to his look . It all starts during a time-out when Rocky the Mountain Lion , the Nuggets ' plushy yellow mascot , heaves up a perfect-looking half-court shot . If he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of queso from Qdoba . But as the ball slo-mos toward the rim , Westbrook races over , leaps up , and pulls a supervillain move , intercepting it and inspiring the most scornful cascade of boos I 've ever heard . <p> Westbrook 's style-provocateur act has already become renowned in the NBA , because he stars on one of the league 's two best teams , appears regularly on nationally televised games -- where coverage of that short catwalk from the bus to the locker room is de rigueur -- and is expected to return to the NBA 's fashion week , the Finals , in June . But he is only one point of light in the league 's new style-savvy firmament , just one Instagram account in a sea of vanity-mirrored baller selfies . After all , the Thunder are merely watching the Heat 's ( bespoke-tailored ) throne . While Kobe Bryant can stand outside the Lakers locker room and proclaim to me , " I 'm the Valentino of the NBA , " as he explains that he 's leaving " the preppy-hipster look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three -- LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , Chris Bosh -- can not relax . Not in a league where Amar'e Stoudemire can be found posting up in the front row of the Lanvin show at Paris fashion week , where Rajon Rondo 's retinue is trying to persuade Givenchy to pour a custom mold exclusively for his size 13 feet , where Steve Nash can pull the faux-disaffected Clooney , brushing off my questions about his style with an " I do n't take it that seriously " while going Gatsby ( that 's Kobe 's nickname for him ) in a suit from a Canadian made-to-order Internet clothier that he has a financial stake in . <p> A few days later , Westbrook 's publicist tells me that within certain rarefied fashion circles , RW is known as " the Kate Moss of the NBA . " Evidently somebody at Vogue wrote this to her in an e-mail . When I ask Russ how he feels about being compared to a female British supermodel famous for making heroin chic and saying things like " Nothing tastes as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " It 's a little different , " he says . " But I think it got said because some people are not afraid to do certain things or wear certain stuff . You have to have a certain swagger about you . " Even Westbrook has his limits , of course -- Kanye 's infamous leather kilt , for instance . Though in his next breath Russ allows that he 'd " be open to it if it were a slimmer fit . " <p> The NBA has had fashion moments before -- Clyde Frazier wearing his wide-brimmed Borsalino on the cover of Esquire , the introduction of the Air Jordan in the mid- ' 80s , Allen Iverson bringing cornrows , baggy jeans , and garish jewelry from the hood to the hardwood in the late ' 90s -- but the sine waves of high fashion and locker-room style have never synced up quite like they do right now . More than in any other sport , basketball showcases the individual ; we can see each player 's tics and idiosyncrasies when he 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we think he is . And at least as far back as Frazier , no sport has been more enmeshed in the allure of black culture and style . But recently , whether it 's sparked by the explosion of social media or the imposition of David Stern 's corporate-friendly dress code , or whether it 's just the logical outcome of the ongoing gene splice of NBA superstars to multinational apparel companies , the players are more self-aware than ever , more cognizant that personal style is a prerequisite for personal brand . Whether they actually love fashion or not , they understand the need to be perceived as style leaders , at least of some kind , in order to maximize their shoe-company contracts . <p> Consider the OKC Thunder . When they 're in uniform , Westbrook and his All-NBA teammate , forward Kevin Durant , are the league 's youngest , most exciting Batman-and-Robin act ; in street clothes -- the term feels nearly archaic -- they are two opposite fronts in the NBA 's escalating style wars . If Westbrook is the NBA 's Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middleton -- aristocratic and punctilious . Whereas Westbrook invites regular hazing from Charles Barkley and three-quarters of Twitter for dressing like a badass Ziggy Stardust in glammy Neil Barrett silver-leather shirts and Givenchy hoodies , Durant keeps it on the Take Ivy tip , seldom venturing far from the prepped-up hipster look favored around the league of late , pairing his Air Jordans or AF1s with various combos of custom-tailored cardigan , collared shirt , and corduroys . He 's running for president , not leading an insurgency . <p> Compared to the NBA 's established style kings , Durant is still on the climb , newly intrigued , still searching for his look . " I always wanted to be fly , " he tells me outside a Barneys in Santa Monica , where he ca n't find one piece of off-the-rack clothing to fit his super-elongated limbs . " I always put stuff together , " he says . " But it was hard for me to find clothes , since I was so tall , my feet were so big , my arms were so long . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest barrier : Not one designer in the industry -- not one -- is thinking six feet nine , 235 , with a plus wingspan when determining next season 's look . Another is functionality : NBA players sweat for a living . They 're most comfortable in workout clothes , because that 's where they live . Until last season , Durant was that guy . Then he was approached after a game by Regi Puckett , an enterprising stylist in Chicago , who told him he could push his look beyond the schoolboy **30;54;TOOLONG gimmick he made famous during the previous year 's playoffs . Now Durant can screen-grab a picture of a peacoat or a pair of slacks that he sees in a magazine or a blog and send it to Puckett , who will get the piece constructed to Durantula proportions . <p> Westbrook , on the other hand , is normal-human-sized ( he 's six feet three ) and can buy straight off the rack . He 's loved shopping since his mother brought him to downtown L.A. 's fashion alley as a little kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after working out , I 'll find some shops and go check it out and see if they have some new stuff . See what 's good . I go to Barneys ; I go to Gucci , Louis , YSL . I go everywhere -- Rodeo Drive , Vivienne Westwood , Marc Jacobs , Joyrich . I 'm all around . " <p> He 's found friends within the haute couture scene , tagging along with Vogue 's Andr ? Leon Talley during New York 's Fashion Week last fall . " ALT 's not really into sports , " he says , " but we were able to conversate about the history of fashion , and I was able to get his perspective on the shows and how the fabrics and the clothes fit on the different girls and guys . " Westbrook is especially proud that , unlike his peers around the league , he 's never hired a stylist . So proud , in fact , that he 's hired a publicist to trumpet the fact that he 's never hired a stylist . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know people that can get me clothes , " he says . " But it 's not like I have somebody that comes to pick out my outfits . " <p> The surest sign that Westbrook has crossed over as a style icon is the venom he inspires . When I ask Puckett who the most stylish man in the NBA is , he insinuates that it 's Kevin and takes a playful jab at Russ in the process . " I 'll say he shares a locker room with the guy that has the most people talking about what he 's wearing . " <p> Durant immediately defuses style-rivalry talk . " When I look in the mirror and I feel good about myself , that 's the only person I 'm trying to impress . " Later , when I talk to Westbrook , he does n't rise to the bait , either , but it 's clear where he rates in his own mind . I tell him Durant admitted to me that he tunes up his look when he 's in a big city like Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hometown ? <p> " Nah , " he says , dismissively . " I dress up everywhere . " <p> Time-wave zero for the modern era of NBA style is 2005 , when the league adopted its new dress code . Vague enough in its language -- dress slacks or dress jeans , dress shoes or dress boots ; collared shirt on the way into the locker room ; no chains , pendants , or medallions worn over clothes ; no hats , etc. -- it was strictly enforced upon introduction . You may recall some controversy . There were cries of racism , complaints that the league was cracking down on hip-hop fashions in deference to squirrelly corporate sponsors . The architect of the code , NBA commissioner David Stern , has always dismissed that idea . " Our guys were photographed coming into buildings looking like they were going to a day at the beach , " he explained to me . <p> What no one disputes , Stern included , is that a cottage industry bloomed in the code 's wake . At this moment in 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a six-foot-seven bespoke tailor with a showroom in downtown Los Angeles ( his clients for suits and separates include Blake Griffin , Chris Bosh , Amar'e Stoudemire , and Tyson Chandler ) , to Laure Heriard Dubreuil , a well-connected French owner of a 20,000-square-foot multi-luxury-brand boutique in Miami Beach called The Webster , to the woman who has elevated the league 's sartorial game higher than anybody else , the Harlem-based stylist Rachel Johnson , a former Essenceassistant who went on to do video shoots for Jay-Z and N.E.R.D. before landing big-name NBA clients like LeBron James . <p> This network cajoles American and European designers into expanding the top end of their size runs -- Dubreuil has successfully lobbied Givenchy to offer menswear sizes up to 62 -- and ensures that the players get dibs on items from seasonal lines . ( Just before New York 's spring Fashion Week , I accompanied Johnson on a mission to Calvin Klein 's midtown showroom to pull olood blazers for Stoudemire ; STAT 's measurements are then sent to Milan , where the jackets are sewn to his size ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an NBA player can help " masculinize " their clothes . " Anybody with any insight understands a &amp;#x2018 ; real guy ' looks to an athlete before he looks to a waify model , " she says , " or even an actor . " <p> Stern freely admits he never saw this coming , and then goes on to imply that he kinda saw this coming . Right after the code was instituted , " a lot of players would whisper to me , I do n't know what the fuss is about . Let 's go ! There was a sense that this allowed players to express their sense of style . Our players , individually , took it as a catalyst to show themselves off . And suddenly the response from the public was so overwhelmingly positive that , you know , it 's getting to be like the red carpet at the Grammys . Who 's dressing you tonight ? Armani . Now they are among the best-looking , best-shaped models in the world . " <p> When I first hook up with the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oracle in Oakland , where they 've just knocked off the Golden State Warriors . LeBron scored the 20,000th point of his career tonight , making him the youngest ever to reach this milestone , and the media scrum around his locker has hardened into a callus . Across the room from Bron , Chris Bosh is in one corner , already dressed in a light fern , unbelievably slim custom Waraire Boswell suit and a " CB " tie bar , with a hardcover of Laura Hillenbrand 's Unbroken visible from his unzipped black Parabellum bag . Dwyane Wade is pulling on a pair of electric-blue Scotch &amp; Soda trousers , which he hikes up to showcase his multicolored hosiery as he hollers , " You need to raise your sock game , " in Ray Allen 's direction . <p> This kind of style smack is constant in the Miami locker room , says veteran swingman Shane Battier -- so constant that " it 's when they stop talking about you that you know you 're in trouble . " Battier , who limits his own aspirations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with jeans ) , says that the pressure on Miami 's Big Three to dress well every day can be too much for even the most tasteful global icon . " LeBron falters occasionally , " Battier declares . " And when he does , we let him know about it . " <p> Bosh , who also works with Rachel Johnson , tells me that while he and Bron " like to be stylish and comfortable , " he thinks Wade is more willing to suffer for fashion . Wade agrees . " I take more risks , knowing there are going to be jokes , " he says . " Chris does n't take many risks -- he dresses very nice , but he keeps it simple . " <p> Perhaps Wade 's most famous risk to date is the pink-chocolate-yellow patent leather Louboutins he wore to the White House on January 28 for the Heat 's traditional **26;86;TOOLONG photo op with President Obama . Wade admits he was nervous about wearing the sneakers on such an official state visit and had to be nudged by his stylist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's former assistant ) . <p> " I 'm always more nervous than her , because I 'm the one who has to put this stuff on , " he says . " This is my second time going to the White House as a champion . This time I decided on the gray suit . I knew everybody was going to go with something dark , so I wanted to do something different . And I had the gray-white-and-black shoes out that went with the suit , and then there was the pink pair . So we sat and thought about it : &amp;#x2018 ; Okay , I can go with the gray-white-and-black ones , but that 's typical , and I do n't do typical all the time , so let 's do something a little different . ' And it worked ! " <p> At the ceremony in the East Room -- and apologies in advance for the logrolling , especially since **32;114;TOOLONG logrolling is the worst kind , but I have to do it , if only for the benefit of the archivists -- Obama said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soul of this team , continue to do whatever it takes to win , including leading the team in blocks , and at the postgame press conferences he dressed well enough to land himself in GQ magazine . " The president then turned away from the podium and , in a scene reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson 's CGI 'd bemusement with Forrest Gump 's bare ass , called out , " Show ' em your kicks here , Dwyane . " Satisfied , Obama turned back to the crowd . " If any of you can pull this off other than Dwyane Wade , let me know . " <p> " Fashion is fun to me , " Wade tells me later . " I feel like the way that I dress says a lot about my personality . A lot of people will not get a chance to talk to me , but when they look at me , they can get an idea of who Dwyane Wade is . " <p> While the Heat are in D.C. hanging with the president , I pay a visit to Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration board . " On the wall behind her desk is a black pinboard with a collage of looks from fashion magazines cut and pasted underneath each one of her famous clients . It all feels so imperial -- courtiers of the court ! Can you imagine Magic or Larry ever having an inspiration board ? But Johnson has a specific trajectory in mind for LeBron and Bosh for the second half of the season . She wants to continue putting distance between them and the preppy look that David Stern affectionately refers to as " nerdwear . " Wade and Barnett , meanwhile , have their own plan for the spring : draining the color from Wade 's look and focusing on texture and silhouette , partly to showcase Wade 's " maturity " and partly as a cross-promotion for the Chinese shoe company Wade promotes , Li-Ning , whose spring line is the Black Collection . <p> When I reconnect with the Heat in Brooklyn two nights after their White House trip , it 's the team 's first-ever visit to the Barclays Center , two weeks before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaver-fur bomber hat -- his teammates are calling him " the Black Russian " -- and a dark green motorcycle jacket by the young British designer Adrien Sauvage . Wade is not quite in Westbrook territory -- he loves clothes but hates to shop . " My stylist has done an unbelievable job of opening my mind , " he says . " Without her I would be behind the curve . She helps me be in the now and in the future . " <p> After the game , a blowout win for the Heat , the visitors locker room is predictably jam-packed . There 's a GQ photographer in here , and plans for a show-offy shot are being hatched , but D-Wade has to shout across the locker room at LeBron to be heard over this din : " HEY , WE GON NA DO THIS PICTURE ? " LeBron looks confused amid all the commotion . He shouts back , " I DU N NO . YOU GON NA DO IT ? " <p> They decide to do something unusual : They walk out together , sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one he wore coming into the arena . It 's dressier . This time it 's an A.P.C . peacoat over a crisp white shirt and tie . He has a black watchman 's cap tilted on his head . Wade is still rocking the Black Russian . <p> The two of them are flanked by security guards who are mean-mugging through the phalanx of lingerers in the Barclays loading dock . LeBron and Wade get caught in an eddy against a wall , where they smile and say hello to a pair of female fans . The photographer is told to stop shooting , because nobody wants this to look weird . But we 're running out of catwalk .
