<p> It 's been a long wait , Louie fans . It 'll be a longer wait yet . But new episodes are finally in the pipeline , ready to come climbing out of that subway station and onto your TV next spring . <p> Last night as part of the Paley Center 's Made in NY television festival , I moderated a panel with Louis CK and his Louie co-executive producer Blair Breard , who said that Louie season 4 went into production this week , with the goal of returning to FX next May . <p> The **30;0;TOOLONG said he took a long-than-usual break between seasons to regain some semblance of a life , as well as to avoid the chaotic production schedule of the show 's first three seasons , when he would be promoting the show 's premiere while still writing and shooting new episodes . For the first time , he 's written a full season of scripts before shooting begins , allowing for a little more polish and ambition in the season . <p> What kind of ambition , Louis CK would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will include more stories that span more than one episode as well as shorter ones . There will be more straight-ahead comedic episodes , as well as some that " I have a stomach ache about . " <p> ( One multi-part story for next year , he says , was originally an idea for a movie . Interestingly , he added , that was also the genesis of the season 1 " God " episode -- about Louie 's past as a religiously-guilty kid -- except that the movie involved statues of the crucified Jesus coming to life and strangling people . ) <p> Before the panel , the Paley Center screened two episodes , which exemplified the show 's range of tones : " Daddy 's Girlfriend , Part 2 , " a sweet , disturbing first-date story ( guest-starring Parker Posey ) , which includes some glorious scenes of the city at night ; and " Barney/Never , " which climaxes in a shot of a kid soaking in a diarrhea-polluted bathtub . ( First question , of course , had to be how they simulated the fouled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Girlfriend , " Louis CK said , is an example of how New York City permeates the show , both visually and in character . Because Louie shoot almost entirely on location -- a move that cuts costs while making it look more expensive -- it can capture both the city 's sleaze and glorious scenes like a montage of Posey and Louis CK gorging on cured fish at Russ and Daughters . And the Posey character , he said , reflected some dates he had in his early days in the city . The thing about New York : " There are a lot of crazy people who do n't look crazy . " <p> A few other topics that came up , in our interview and in questions from the audience : <p> * Last year 's finale , " New Year 's Eve , " was shot partly in Beijing ( though Breard first suggested they shoot in Chinatown ) . One problem , once they arrived in China , was how much of it in fact " looks like Columbus , Ohio . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street in China compared with NYC , " because people do n't have rights . " <p> * An audience member asked about a scene in season 3 , in which a character played by Melissa Leo roughly forces Louie to reciprocate oral sex . Louis CK said he did n't consider the scene rape -- " She did what she had to do , " he said drily -- though he acknowledged an earlier episode in which his character appears to be molested under anesthesia by a dentist . Asked if FX had issues with the content , he joked , " I said , either I get raped , or I 'm not doing the show . " <p> * Toughest place to shoot in New York City ? What 's the toughest place to do anything in New York City ? Yep , the subway . <p> * Could a big network make a show like Louie ? No , he said , nor should they . When you 're making a show for millions of dollars an episode , " that money comes with a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as advertisers who do n't want to be near offensive content . " Our advertisers are , what , Red Stripe beer ? They do n't give a fuck what we 're doing ! " <p> And that 's as it should be , he said . Louie , he said , is n't a show for millions of people . " This is for a few of us , " he said , gesturing to the small , sold-out auditorium , " to get together and enjoy a tub of diarrhea. "
