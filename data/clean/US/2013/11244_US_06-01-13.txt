reflecting on a quarter-century of growth in portland 's performing arts scene  the highlight of the portland center for performing arts ' grand-opening in 1987 was a performance by high-wire artists phillippe petit and ann seward , which reflected the thrilling risk the city had taken with the project . steven nehl/the oregonian  stephanie mulligan , who has been with artists repertory theatre since the mid 1980s , knew the portland theater scene in its younger , wilder days . " there were more trails of glitter than there are today -- i mean that literally , " she says . " i like to think there was a lot more nudity , but that might just be a trick of memory . "  these days , portland theater , and the city 's arts scene in general , is n't so stripped down . but it is much more glittery , if not literally than metaphorically . look around and you 'll see it : the sparkle of widespread creative activity , the shine of technical and artistic quality .  there 's music -- most definitely in food , if you want to extend the definition of the creative culture -- and perhaps in other areas as well , this is portland 's golden age . sure , the city 's artsy eccentricities can grow ripe for lampooning , as the tv spoof " portlandia " has proved . but such attention would be nonsensical ( or at least much more embarrassing ) if there was n't more going on here than adult kickball leagues and mustache-growing contests , if many of the eccentrics were n't really artists .  a certain shoestring flamboyance , as mulligan 's recollections of leaner times suggest , is nothing new here . but the size , scope and solidity of the arts in portland is something that 's grown over the past quarter century .  that 1987 and ' 88 marked a pivotal time in portland arts was clear even then . more than a decade of planning and haggling was coming to fruition . the idea for a set of new performance spaces began taking place around 1976 due to dissatisfaction with civic auditorium satisfying venue ) . in 1981 , voters passed a $19 million bond issue . next came political squabbles , cost overruns ( from $25 million to $41 million by the time it opened ) and a scramble to find money for operating costs . but eventually the civic was joined by the arlene schnitzer concert hall ( a refurbished 1928 movie palace ) and a new multi-use building next door .  " ten or 20 years from now , few will remember all the effort , dreaming , planning and yes , the bickering , mistakes and accusations that marked the creation of the portland center for the performing arts , " the oregonian 's joan laatz wrote in august , 1987 , when the multi-use new theater building ( now named antoinette hatfield hall ) opened .  meanwhile , city officials had been looking for an anchor tenant to take up residence in the center 's the 900-seat space now known as the newmark theatre . a study commissioned by the fred meyer trust concluded that not even the city 's top existing theater company , portland organizationally . cynthia fuhrman , a veteran theater marketing exec , recalls that portland was the largest city in the country that did n't have a company in the league of resident theatres , the association of major regional theaters . after being courted on and off for years , ashland 's oregon shakespeare festival signed on , and its new satellite operation , dubbed portland center stage , stepped into the lights in nov. 1988 .  after seeing the new company in the new building , time magazine said that portland at last could stake a claim to sophistication and social significance . ' '  more so than social stature , the goal was for the pcpa to both bring more touring talents to town and give local troupes a comfortable home that would help them grow their audiences , and for pcs to provide a model of quality , stability and professionalism that might lift the community as a whole . the fear was that higher production costs in the new facilities would make things tougher for most local arts companies , and that the venerable osf .  " there was so much buzz about osf coming up , " recalls beth harper , who 'd soon launch what 's now called portland actors conservatory . " i was in a show at new rose and everyone felt like , ' the big guys are coming and we 've never got that kind of attention . ' " " one of the things that still rings true , " harper adds , " is the big boys are still the big boys and the small ones are still the small ones . "  though perhaps not . yes , center stage , which split from osf to become an independent company in 1994 , remains atop the theatrical food chain . what were the largest or most active homegrown companies back in the late ' 80s -- portland rep , new rose , storefront portland civic theater -- long ago folded . ( as mulligan recalls , " it took about five years for the dust to settle -- unfortunately the dust was some fine companies . " ) and as it did then , the stage a few shows a year in rented or makeshift spaces .  numerous factors are involved , not just the anchoring effects of pcpa and pcs , but the theater scene now has a broader range of companies . artists repertory theatre , once a scrappy little operation in rented space at the downtown ywca , grew to become the city 's no. 2 company , with a $2.4 million budget and its own twin-auditorium home . down the scale in budget , but punching above their weight artistically , third rail rep , portland playhouse and profile theatre form a strong middle tier .  however persistent the funding challenges of the dance world , a similar vertical growth , if you will , can be found . in the late ' 80s , portland had both ballet oregon and pacific ballet theatre ; for contemporary dance , portland state university housed a concert series for touring groups and a top-notch resident company . now , oregon ballet theatre ( the result of a merger of the aforementioned ballet troupes ) survives , white bird does concert presenting at polaris dance theatre each have performance spaces and expanding reputations .  " i think the arts scene was like a young teenager then and has grown up a lot , " says regional arts &amp; culture council executive director eloise damrosch , who moved to portland in ' 87 . " our reputation as a place to visit has really skyrocketed . i 'm struck when i open up the a&amp;e and see all the options . there 's a lot more happening , and such a range . "  quantity is n't the only thing that 's changed .  " back then , there was this grittier , shoestring quality that imbued almost every company , " mulligan says . " the dedication to art was inspiring ... but when i look back at that earlier renaissance of the ' 80s , the truth was the talent pool of the city needed to step up . "  jim fullan , who has worked in marketing at portland opera and the oregon symphony , says the city has developed a " radically different sense of our place such an inferiority complex regarding seattle , san francisco and los angeles that it distrusted artistic ambition . " the public would punish you for getting too big for your britches . the prevailing attitude was , ' it 's good enough for us . we like it . ' now , that 's totally gone . it 's almost the opposite . if you 're not aspiring to be world-class , you 're not on the boat . the arts -- in tandem with food , beer and wine -- have raised us up . "  the building of the pcpa has n't solved all of the performance-space issues for local companies ( there 's a big , problematic gap between the 900-seat newmark and the schnitzer and keller , which seat close to 3,000 ) . and it 's notable that center stage had to move to a home of its own , a renovated 19th-century armory in the pearl district , to begin fulfilling its potential as a truly vibrant hub for the theater scene . but those two big moves have , over time , proved other developments have helped shape the portland of today . some observers point to the fundraising success of john and lucy buchanan at the portland art museum 1994 to 2005 . " they actually made a case that a great city needs great art , " says bodyvox co-founder jamey hampton . " and that put a gauntlet down . "  leadership changes in 2003 at portland opera , oregon ballet theatre and the oregon symphony also marked a crucial transition . hampton points to tom manley , president of pacific northwest college of art as " probably the best leader of an arts organization the city has . " pnca has grown to be a leading creative and economic force in the pearl district ... and it 's in the process of remaking how that neighborhood looks . it 's not splashy , like when pink martini plays new year 's eve at the schnitz . it 's quiet , but it 's really foundational . "  through it all , the essential challenges remain much the same : make good work , expand audiences , cultivate donors business model , away from a focus on big-money patrons and toward building long-term relationships with supporters of all sorts , nurturing them along the path from first-time ticket buyer to subscriber to contributor and so on . others point out that the city is awash in heavily subsidized art -- but that the artists themselves provide the subsidy comes from the artists themselves , in the form of the second jobs , lack of health care , or multiple roommates that allow them to subsist as artists .  all together , what 's changed and what 's stayed the same add up to an arts scene that , while still facing major challenges , has grown bigger , wider and better integrated into the world around it .  " i do n't think it happens in isolation , " fuhrman says . " it 's about the growth of the city as a whole . "
