<h> Latest Trends in Intelligent Robot End-of-Arm Tooling <p> The role of robot end-of-arm tooling has never been more important . With robot users demanding more versatility in their processes , manufacturers are under pressure to deliver flexible , intelligent end-of-arm tooling ( EOAT ) that adds value to the overall system . From servo grippers and hybrid tooling , to advanced tool changers and control modules , today 's EOAT is not only easier to implement and easier to use , it 's down right smart . <p> Application-specific grippers are bringing robotics within arm 's length of a broader audience , to new industries and small to midsized businesses that would have considered it out of reach just a year ago . A new breed of anthropomorphic end effector not only plays nice in the lab , it 's finding its way onto the shop floor . And a magnetic gripper that 's the polar opposite of anything on the market is attracting fans . <p> Pick and place , weld , deburr , apply material , inspect and locate , load/unload -- and do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauntlet , and manufacturers are raising their " hands " to the challenge . <p> Flexible , Intelligent EOAT With a glut of homogenous grippers on the market , leading manufacturers are working to differentiate themselves from the commodity-laden torrent . End-of-arm tooling manufacturers are asking themselves how they can add more value to their EOAT . <p> " The way we 're adding value is with smarter and more flexible end effectors , EOAT that actually acts with intelligence rather than placing the burden on the robot itself , " says Henry Loos , Application Engineer at Applied Robotics Inc. in Glenville , New York . As a result , we 're starting to see lines of demarcation among different manufacturers , and customers are shopping around more . " <p> " By moving intelligence out to the end-of-arm tooling and allowing the end effector to make some positioning decisions on its own , independent of the robot , we wind up with a system that the robot programmer can then program more quickly and easily , " says Loos . " People are pumping out applications much quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upfront for this intelligent end-of-arm tooling , you 'll save tons in expensive programming labor , " he says . " And when you need to make a quick change to the system , the faster your EOAT allows you to make that change , the less downtime you will have and the less you will be paying your process engineers to re-process the station . " <p> Servo Grippers Flexibility is one of the biggest differentiators and the common denominator in the latest EOAT trends . Robot users are asking for end-of-arm tooling that can handle multiple sizes of similar materials , or end effectors to handle different kinds of materials , or hybrid technologies that tackle multiple tasks with the same EOAT . <p> " Our customers want to utilize the same tool for various sized bags without having to use some kind of manual width adjustment , " says John Westbeld , Engineering Manager at SAS Automation LLC in Xenia , Ohio . " Our new Servo Bag Gripper SBG50 incorporates a servomotor with a belt and pulley system to automatically adjust on-the-fly between different bag widths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate one robot on two lines with different sized bags . It will adjust the width on-the-fly from one side to the other as you palletize two different lines at the same time , with one robot and one EOAT . " <p> This video shows the servo bag gripper in action handling different sized bags . <p> Westbeld says that the robot must be preconfigured with a 7th axis controller in order to control a servomotor . " It 's more user friendly for the teach pendant and programming because the servo-driven EOAT shows up as a 7th axis just like any other axis on the robot . It 's more work on our end , but much more user friendly . " <p> " By building the user friendliness right into the equipment , it 's also easier on the integrator , " he adds . " There 's less programming knowledge involved . If any portion of the project can be simplified , they can install it faster and troubleshoot it easier . " <p> Applied Robotics ' Loos extols the benefits of servo-based , flexible grippers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part , meaning the robot programmer does n't have to hit that perfect spot all the time to grip the part . It saves an incredible amount of time . Servo also gives you an almost infinite range of options in positioning . Whereas an air cylinder-based clamp is either open or it 's closed . You 're either grabbing or you 're not grabbing . With servo you can engage a part that is slightly irregular or packaged in a slightly irregular way . " <p> This video shows a compact , servo-driven gripper used for biomedical applications where tight tolerances are often required . " It has to fit in tight spaces , move precisely and handle product very gently , " says Loos . " In tight spaces , like handling titration trays , tubes , etc. , the consequences of a dropped item are very steep . " <p> Modular Vacuum Grippers End-of-arm tooling designed to handle various kinds of materials in varying shapes and sizes is also trending . " Many of our customers are looking for lighter-weight tooling , especially when they want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more flexibility in the EOAT often means more components and more weight ) but at same time they still want to use the smallest robot possible , " says Volker Schmitz , President of Schmalz Inc. in Raleigh , North Carolina . <p> " This is especially true in the consumer goods industry where the packaging is changing so often , " he adds . " Customers are asking for tooling that will not only handle their current packaging , but packaging two to three years down the road , but we do n't know what it 's going to look like in the future . " <p> Schmalz recently launched its large-area vacuum gripping system , the FMP . The patent-pending " vacuum bars " as Schmitz refers to them are designed to handle various materials such as wood , metal sheet , glass , cardboard , or plastic with different shapes , surfaces and dimensions . <p> " With suction cups , the problem is that the cup has to completely cover a product , " explains Schmitz . " If it hits half on a box or pouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not generating vacuum and it 's just leaking air . " <p> " The vacuum bar does n't care where the product is located . It 's kind of like a vacuum cleaner in how anything underneath it gets sucked up . But it does n't have to perfectly seal around everything that it 's gripping . The vacuum bars can handle a lot of different shaped and sized products without having to change the gripper . " <p> " If the product is a sheet metal or a glass , or these paver stones ( as shown ) , that stay level or flat , then we can pick those up with an engineered foam and that 's usually the best product because it 's the most versatile on those kinds of materials . " <p> Hybrid Tooling Another trend is ' hybrid tooling ' that combines multiple gripper technologies in one end-of-arm tool . " Customers want one universal gripper for all parts , " says Schmitz . " So that 's what we try to focus on , is engineering an EOAT that will grip all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sometimes have to use a combination of different technologies all in one tool . For example , part of the tool will have suction . Another part will have a mechanical clamping arm around it . " <p> This video shows a hybrid EOAT in a palletizing demo moving entire layers of different materials . <p> Advanced Tool Changers No stranger to the EOAT market , tool changers have continued to get more flexible , robust and easier to use . But with these advancements come new challenges . <p> " We 're seeing demand for tool changers that have the ability to pass through more utilities , and even more challenging needs like incorporating vision and different bus networks , " says Catherine Morris , Director of Automotive Sales at ATI Industrial Automation in Apex , North Carolina . <p> " Tool changers have had electric and air pass-through for awhile , " says Dan Peretz , VP North America of IPR Robotics Inc. in Troy , Michigan . " The trend now is allowing other materials to pass through the tool changer . IPR has developed patented tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is paint , PVC or wax . There are a variety of different materials being applied in various applications . " <p> " We 're expanding into areas requiring components that can stand up to extreme heat , extreme cold , high-pressure water applications , both for high-pressure cleaning and underwater applications , and other extremes such as radiation , " says Bob Little , ATI 's CEO . <p> ATI recently introduced its largest tool changer , the QC-1510 Heavy-Duty Tool Changer , which can handle payloads up to 4,080 kg . The modular construction allows integration with applications requiring high-power , coolant , servo , a variety of bus networks , and discrete signal capabilities by incorporating separate modules that can be mounted on any of nine available flats . <p> Along with the largest , ATI also recently developed its smallest tool changer . The QC-001 Micro Tool Changer weighs less than 122 grams while handling up to 1.4-kg payloads . Morris says the micro was developed in response to robot manufacturers introducing high-speed delta robots . <p> " On the other side of the spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , was developed in response to a non-robotic application , " says Morris . " It was a big gantry system where they were trying to move around half of an airplane and our strongest was n't quite up to it . " <p> In addition to the flexibility tool changers provide and the safety aspects of reducing the frequency the operator has to enter the robot cell to change end effectors , ATI 's CEO says one of the primary benefits of tool changers is maintenance . " It 's a time issue . When we 're talking about somebody changing out an end effector , we 're looking at maybe 20 minutes of work for somebody to get it off a robot and get another one back on . A tool changer can do it in 3 to 6 seconds . " <p> " Then you have the other benefit which is quality , " Little continues . " When a robot is exchanging tools with a tool changer , it 's done quickly and accurately . If it 's done manually , you have the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . That can create a malfunction later in the line . " <p> This video shows one of ATI 's tool changers in action exchanging packaging end effectors . <p> Intelligent Control Modules Part of making end-of-arm tooling more intelligent is allowing for better communication between the robot and the end effector , and ultimately providing valuable feedback to the end user . Intelligent control modules are bridging the gap between the robot controller , the tool changer and the end effector modules . <p> Applied Robotics released the latest iteration of its SmartComm ? Control Module . The system 's designer , Henry Loos , describes how it works to the end user 's advantage . <p> " Not only does it allow our customer to change tooling without suffering any ill network and bus effects , we can now look at the customer 's devices on the end-of-arm tooling and report back to him with any issues about his EOAT , even if it 's not our end effector . Our aim was to make this much easier for maintenance by doing some of that work for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in that it is designed to intrinsically handle many of the standard bus networks on the market without having to completely redesign the system , especially if last-minute changes are made to the bus , " says Loos . " And it can talk to any robot controller . " <p> The control module is designed to work with Applied 's Sigma line of tool changers , including its newly released Sigma NextGen ? tool changer ( shown in the photo ) . Loos says it 's the strongest tool changer in its class with driver design and cam geometry to provide increased moment and acceleration at high payloads , up to 1,500 kg . <p> " It has a fail-safe coupling mechanism . We can lose nearly all of the air to the changer and still maintain our moment and load rating somewhere up to around 80 percent of total , " Loos adds . " It takes a little more time ( milliseconds ) to fully engage those cams into a coupled state , but once we get there we 're so much safer against loss of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high part variability , tool changers may not always be practical . That 's where highly adaptable , anthropomorphic end effectors are entering the work envelope . <p> Anthropomorphic and Adaptable Finger Grippers Largely confined to research labs until recently , where their flexibility and versatility were sought after for testing disruptive robotics technologies , a new breed of anthropomorphic grippers are increasingly strutting their digits on the factory floor . They have grabbed the attention of human collaborative robots designed to work alongside humans in less-structured environments and in small to midsized businesses where robotics is becoming more accessible . <p> " Manufacturers are looking for reliable , rugged , flexible and reusable handling solutions , " says Guy Robert , Director of Marketing at Robotiq in Saint-Nicolas , Quebec , Canada . " In past years , manufacturers have seen tool changers as a solution . But costs related to custom tooling design and changeovers made this solution not so attractive for many manufacturers who have to produce parts in low volume . " <p> " Manufacturers are also looking to automate applications where there is a high mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle due to their shape or the material ( fragile , brittle ) used to build them . So having a flexible handling tool that can grip a wide variety of parts becomes very important . It becomes even more important when manufacturers want to use this same tool for future production processes . " <p> A relatively young company in the end-of-arm tooling arena , Robotiq offers a line of flexible and adaptive industrial robot grippers with what Robert refers to as " mechanical intelligence " designed to handle a wide variety of part shapes , sizes and composite materials . The idea is that by using a single robot gripper , the user saves on tooling costs and can improve process efficiencies . <p> Robotiq 's electric , servo-driven 2-finger and 3-finger grippers enable the user to control grasping factors such as the opening/closing speed of the fingers , force applied on the object being handled , and precise control of the fingers to enable partial open and close for fast cycle times . <p> The adaptive 2-finger grippers are designed for day-to-day manufacturing where engineers want to automate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical cell has to handle 5 to 20 different parts , and instead of using a tool changer with many different end effectors , a single robot gripper represents time saved on changeovers and reduced tooling costs . <p> This video shows a variety of applications for Robotiq adaptable grippers , including bin picking , machine tending and flexible fixturing for welding . <p> The 3-finger gripper is designed for advanced manufacturing and research . According to Robotiq , it combines the flexibility of anthropomorphic functionality with the reliability of manufacturing EOAT , and reduces programming complexity while providing more gripping options . <p> In this video Robotiq 3-finger grippers are used to perform 3D bin picking and assembly tasks . They even wield traditional tools for some operations . <p> Another relative newcomer to the robotic EOAT stage is attracting attention with a magnetic personality . <p> Switchable Magnetic Technology A magnetic technology originally hailing from Down Under is creating buzz in the automation world . Switchable permanent magnets emerged from a five-year strategic R&amp;D program funded by the Australian government . <p> This patented technology uses opposing magnetic fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse the magnetic field . Commercialization of the technology was launched by Magswitch Technology from its headquarters in Colorado , where all Magswitch products were designed and tested , most notably a new line of magnetic robot grippers like no other . <p> " We 're different because other end effectors on the market use high air pressure to rip a magnet away from the material , which causes impact stress on the magnet and results in shorter service life , " says Michael Blanchard , Engineering Manager at Magswitch Technology Inc. in Westminster , Colorado . <p> Unlike electromagnets , Magswitch end effectors will remain in the on position if the system loses electric input or air . Blanchard also notes that electromagnets require battery backup and expensive cabling that must be replaced every year . <p> " Our magnets are much lighter , stronger and easier to turn on and off than any other magnetic switches . Our smallest tool weighs 0.2 lb and has a maximum holding force of 55 lbf . Mechanical grippers are inherently heavy pieces of equipment on the order of three to five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robot that is 20 to 35 percent smaller . " <p> But they can go big , too . You may have seen Magswitch in action at IMTS in Chicago . This video from the event shows a FANUC M-2000iA robot bench-pressing a 1200-kg railway wheelset using 8 Magswitch magnets generating a combined gripping force of 24,000 lbf . <p> The Magswitch automation line has five product areas . The three primary gripper models include the M-Series , which is a small , single housing designed for flat surfaces . The AR-Series grippers are designed for irregular shapes and come with removable , customizable pole shoes , which Blanchard says customers can cut to fit their particular part configuration . <p> " Our circular array tool ( the AY-Series shown in the photo ) is a patented design that uses multiple magnets with different magnetic fields to create a very shallow depth of field to destack sheet material , " explains Blanchard . " We can land on a piece of material 0.7 mil thick and take one sheet off of the top of another . It has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly and do n't necessarily have to be in balance . " <p> In this video , Magswitch grippers are used in an automotive manufacturing facility to sort and stage small door panel inner components for a subsequent welding process . In the first phase of the process a delta robot is using vision guidance and a Magswitch AR gripper with extended pole shoes to pick , sort and place different parts onto the appropriate conveyor channels . <p> Once on the conveyors , the parts are picked by an articulating robot equipped with a high-speed rotary tool and Magswitch AR grippers , each with particular pole-shoe styles custom cut to fit each part configuration . The robot then uses the rotary tool to nest the parts into the appropriate welding fixtures on a turntable . <p> Right now , a small amount of air is required to turn the magnets on and off . " The largest consumable cost in most production lines is the generation of vacuum , " says Blanchard . " We reduce the consumption of air by around 90 percent . Many factories are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology in 2015 . " <p> Application-Specific Grippers In order to differentiate themselves and meet demands of an ever-increasing number of industries and applications implementing automation , EOAT manufacturers are exploring specialized solutions for unique or extreme applications . <p> SAS Automation designed and developed specialized needle grippers used for removing muffins , cupcakes and other baked goods from baking pans , a process called ' depanning . ' Designed for high-volume , low maintenance depanning , the SAS Muffin Depanner has custom stainless steel needle grippers , each using 4 curved needles to depan 144 muffins from 2 moving baking pans on an oven conveyor . <p> SAS ' engineering manager says the small-diameter needles leave limited evidence of penetration . " This application also involves hygienic design with stainless steels and food-grade-type polymers , so that everything can be washed down and cleaned , " says Westbeld . " We 've also used this style of gripper to handle vinyl for automotive applications . " <p> IPR Robotics custom-designed an end-of-arm tool for handling aluminum die cast automotive engine blocks . The pneumatic-driven EOAT is two-sided for loading/unloading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on one side . The other side incorporates 3-jaw grippers , 4 in a row , for loading sleeve inserts into the mold prior to casting the part . <p> " The end-of-arm tool has to be very precise in order to properly insert the liner sleeves into the molds before loading the part , " says IPR 's Peretz . " It also has to be robust to withstand extreme temperatures . " <p> " The tooling manufacturers that are going to continue to thrive , " says Schmitz , " are the ones that are adopting or embracing as many technologies as possible for gripping and combining them to come up with new solutions . " <p> From dual-duty grippers to intelligent communication modules , the scope of end-of-arm tooling is reaching broader and aiming higher to make the entire robotic system more effective and efficient .
