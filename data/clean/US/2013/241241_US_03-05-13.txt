And for those 55 and older , it takes at least a year on average to find work , longer than any other age group . Fifty-five-year-old software developer Geoffrey Weglarz , who has been unemployed for two years , explains why being a jobless single dad can be a blessing , but a costly one .  There is no doubt : the economy is " recovering . " You see it long-term trendline : 2.5 percent . You see it in the housing market , characterized as " surging , " with prices up in every major city -- on average , 9 percent higher than a year ago . You see it in the stock market , as high as its ever been .  With the release Friday of the job numbers for April , you see it in the unemployment numbers . For a change , both monthly surveys -- of employers and of households -- agree : the economy added at least 165,000 jobs last month and 114,000 more jobs than had previously been reported for February and March .  But then how is it , you may ask , that the official unemployment rate , known as " U-3 ? in government parlance , barely budged and remains at 7.5 percent ?  How is it that our own far more inclusive measure of unemployment and underemployment , the " U-7 , " is down a tick but still weighs in at a whopping 16 percent ?  U-7 includes everyone in the government 's U-3 looked for one in the past 4 weeks . It also adds everyone who said they wanted one , had n't looked in the past 4 weeks , but had in the past year . ( These people are included in the government 's most inclusive statistic , U-6 ) . But we also add people who had n't looked in the past year but still said they wanted a job and would take one . Finally , we add people working part-time , but say they are looking for full-time work , like " consultants " I know , who may have worked only one hour in the week the government survey taker came calling , but are still tallied as officially " employed . "  Here is my Solman Scale breakdown of the numbers for April :  How can it be that , were we to compare today 's number to unemployment as reckoned in the past ( by adding working age Americans who would probably be unemployed , but are instead drawing disability -- more than 8 million , or in prison -- more than 2 II highs ? ( See our NewsHour report on the undercounting of unemployment ) .  How can it be that , that in a " recovery , " and by the narrowest ( U-3 ) definition , 9 percent of Latinos , 13.2 percent of Afro-Americans , and 24 percent of teenagers are unemployed , meaning they looked for work in the past week but did n't find even one hour 's worth ?  How can it be , finally , that 4.4 million Americans continue to be out of work for 27 weeks or more and for those 55 or older , it takes a year , on average , to find a job ?  That 's the topic of our segment on PBS NewsHour on the Friday evening broadcast as we introduce viewers to a range of capable , earnest and articulate older workers who simply have n't been able to find a job . One of them , 55-year-old software developer Geoffrey Weglarz , who has now taught himself video production , has an especially poignant story to tell .  We met Weglarz at in Bridgeport , Conn . Weglarz told us he 'd been unemployed for 711 days . How did he know the exact number ? Turns out he keeps a spreadsheet tracking the 481 jobs he 's applied for in the last two years . In the top corner is a tally of the days since he lost his job in April 2011 .  Weglarz spoke heartrendingly of the financial and emotional challenges of long-term unemployment , as you can see in the excerpt from our interview at the top of this post .  ( We contacted Weglarz on Thursday to follow up and see if he had since gained employment . His response : " Still no job , but getting a little freelance video production work .
