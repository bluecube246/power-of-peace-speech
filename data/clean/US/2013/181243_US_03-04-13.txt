So , in addition to the writing and targeting advice we 've offered in our articles , we 'll be sharing tips on Web design , how to establish an online presence , how to best utilize social media , and more . To get the ball rolling , we 're starting with one of the most important features of an author website -- one you 'll need to quickly grow repeat visitors . Keep reading to learn how to implement a strong call to action on your author website and build your author platform . <p> Call To Action : What It Is And How To Use It <p> A call to action is a clear statement , instructing your visitors what to do or how to reach a goal , whether it be trivial or important . With a strong call to action , you tell your visitors , " Do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as subtly as the wording of a menu option . <p> A subtle call to action would be to label your published works page , " Read My Published Work , " instead of " Published Work . " The former is a call to action , and the latter is neutral information . <p> An overt call to action would be , " Enter the contest here ! " and " Join the mailing list to receive weekly tips , " which say openly to the visitor , " You should do this . " By writing , " You can enter the contest here , " you imply , " if you feel like it , " which wo n't give your visitors the same psychological push to follow through . <p> 3 Ways Writers Can Use Calls To Action <p> As a writer , you need a call to action on your author website to attract repeat visitors and promote your online platform . And while you might not have any books for sale , and you might not have a mailing list yet , the following calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his or her website . <p> Note : You do n't want to overwhelm visitors with too many calls to action right on the homepage . Based on your biggest priority , choose one of the following items for your homepage 's main call to action . <p> Social media pages . It 's important for any writer to promote himself or herself on social media . And while different social media pages lend themselves to writing more than others ( Twitter and Facebook are very text-based while Pinterest is better suited for images ) , you should invest ample time in building your presence on multiple social media forms . If that 's your strength , you should direct your visitors to your well-followed Twitter feed or your haiku-a-day Facebook fan page . <p> Mailing lists . One of the best ways to build your repeat audience is to create a mailing list . A first-time visitor is more likely to come back to your website or social media pages if he/she is actively receiving new e-mails in his/her inbox from you , directing him/her to " Click here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to action to sign up for your mailing list , first-time visitors probably wo n't be inclined to fill out the sign-up form -- or , worse , they wo n't even realize that you have a mailing list because it was n't clearly stated on the most heavily trafficked pages of your website . <p> Selling books or other products or services . If you 've self-published or traditionally published any books , chapbooks , e-books , etc. , or offer services like ghostwriting or proofreading , it 's important to funnel your visitors toward those items you have for sale . If they 're not interested in purchasing anything , they can still browse the rest of the site , and you 've eliminated the chance that a happy visitor clicked out of the site before realizing that he/she could purchase your written work or services . <p> By using calls to action in a purposeful way , you 'll greatly increase your repeat visitors and active participators . And remember : You do n't need to be heavy-handed with your calls to action . There are very subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . By giving one direct instruction instead of multiple options or wishy-washy offers , you can better build your online platform .
