Traverse the 600-mile trail that connects California 's 21 missions . Peer behind an ornate mission altarpiece that , for more than two centuries , has hidden murals painted by the Ohlone Indians . Uncover the mysteries of Mission Dolores ' ancient cemetery .  CyArk , a non-profit digital scanning company based in Oakland , is creating the digital El Camino Real , documenting some of the oldest buildings and historic sites in California .  LISTEN  Like Interstate 101 " Some people think the Camino Real means the Royal Road of Jesus in California , " says Andrew Galvan , curator of Mission Dolores , San Francisco . " No . It was the King 's Highway , the King of Spain 's highway . "  Mission Dolores , founded in 1776 , is the oldest surviving structure in San Francisco and Real to be scanned and documented by CyArk .  " If you step out the front door of Mission Dolores you are on the El Camino Real , " says Andrew . " It was a public road , like Interstate 101 . All the California Missions are connected . Wherever you got on it , the road led you to the Viceroy 's Palace in Mexico City . "  CyArk 's Laser Scanning MissionCyArk has digitally preserved over 70 sites around the world from Pompeii in Italy , to Tikal in Guatemala .  " We use a 3 D laser scanner that sends out a pulsed laser beam and captures billions of points of these structures at a rate of about 100,000 points a second , " explains Elizabeth Lee who directs operations at CyArk . These sites are at risk , endangered due to everyday exposure to the elements , vandalism , war , urbanization , poorly managed tourism , catastrophic events , and general neglect .  The non profit organization was founded in 2003 by Ben and Barbara Kacyra after they sold their technology imaging , mapping , modeling , and CAD system which is currently used worldwide in architecture , engineering and construction , entertainment and crime forensics .  " It was right at the time that the Bamiyam Buddhas were blown up by the Taliban , " remembers Barbara Kacyra . " There was no 3 dimensional documentation of them . We said , ' How can we use this technology to help architects , archaeologists , and preservationists get better tools than tape measures and a clip boards and a pencils to go in and document these heritage sites . "  Hidden Mural Revealed  Historic carved altarpiece from Mexico installed in front of mural painted by Indians .  Sometimes new things are revealed during the scanning process . At Mission Dolores , CyArk worked hard to get behind the very ornately carved reredos , a false wall in back of the altar that was made in Mexico and shipped to the Mission by boat in 1796 . For more than 200 years , the reredos has obscured a mural that was painted by the Indians when the mission a two foot space behind the frame where the statues are today , " says Andrew . " Very few have ever been able to see what 's behind . Using fiber optics they 'll be able to get a little pin wheel and be able to photograph . Then you 'll be able to click on say Saint Joachim with your smart phone and boom ! You 'll be able to see behind , floor to ceiling , the mural that the Indians painted here at Mission Dolores .  " It 's not about the sites themselves , " says Barbara Kacyra , " It 's really about the stories . Whether it was Manzanar or Angor Wat , or Pompeii . It 's about the humanness of these sites . "  The History of San Francisco  There are almost 6000 Indians buried in the Mission Dolores cemetery , relates Andy Galvan , whose relationship to the Mission is much more than Museum Curator . Andrew is an Ohlone Indian whose ancestors were some of the first people baptized , married and buried at the Mission Dolores the gravemarkers you 're going to read the history of San Francisco , " he says . " The 21 California missions are cultural heritage sites . These are our monuments . The Digital El Camino Real is about digitally imagining , about preservation . But it 's also about interpretation . It 's about what happened at the California Missions . "  Andy Galvan 's Ohlone Indian ancestors are buried in the cemetery at Mission Dolores .
