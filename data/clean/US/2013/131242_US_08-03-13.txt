a mass extinction of lizard species is a real possibility in coming decades as a result of climate change , new research from the university of lincoln has found . certain lizard species have taken a one-directional evolutionary path that involves them giving live birth rather than laying eggs , this has allowed lizards to live further north than possible if they were laying eggs . but this evolutionary path is apparently ireeversible , once a lizard species has developed it , they lose the ability to go back to laying eggs , which would be necessary for them in a wamer climate . the speed at which climate change is occurring largely precludes many species from simply changing where they live , it 's possibly for some species , but many will very likely go extinct as a result of not being able to extend their range to more appropriate climates . the researchers predict that dozens of lizard species may become extinct within only the next 50 years .  it 's been observed all over the globe that lizards with lizards with viviparous reproduction such as in skinks ) are doing poorly with regards to changing weather patterns . and the new research shows that is likely their viviparous reproduction , an adaption that has been key to their success in the past , that is limiting their ability to adapt .  " researchers , including academics from the university of exeter , investigated the hypothesis that historical invasions of cold climates by liolaemus lizards -- one of the most diverse groups of vertebrates on earth -- have only been possible due to their evolution to viviparity ( live birth ) from oviparity ( laying eggs ) . remarkably , once these species evolve viviparity , the process is mostly irreversible and they remain restricted to such cold climates . "  " by analysing this evolutionary transition in the lizards ' reproductive modes and projecting the future impact of climate change , the scientists discovered that increasing temperatures in the species ' historically cold habitats would result in their areas of distribution being significantly reduced . as a consequence , if global warming continues at the same rate , viviparous lizards are facing author , dr. daniel pincheira-donoso said : " lizards ' reproduction is largely linked to climatic temperatures and viviparous species are usually found in cold environments . when reptiles initially moved to colder areas they needed to evolve emergency measures to succeed in these harsh places , and we believe viviparity is one of these key measures . however , this transition is mostly one-directional and unlikely to be reversed . rapid changes in the environment 's temperature would demand rapid re-adaptations to secure the species ' survival . through the research we found that over the next 50 years nearly half of the area where these species occur may disappear , causing multiple extinctions due to climate change . "  the general conclusion of the research is that " although viviparity allowed lizards in the past to invade and adapt to live in cold environments , and was therefore a key trait for evolutionary success , it will now ultimately lead to multiple events of extinction . "  dr pincheira-donoso said : " these lizards are one of the most diverse groups of animals , and are able reduction in cold environments will reduce their areas of existence , which means that their successful evolutionary history may turn into a double-edged sword of adaptation . their extinctions would be an atrocious loss to biodiversity . "  dr dave hodgson , from the university of exeter , said : " climate change must not be underestimated as a threat to modern patterns of biodiversity . our work shows that lizard species which birth live young instead of laying eggs are restricted to cold climates in south america : high in the andes or towards the south pole . as the climate warms , we predict that these special lizard species will be forced to move upwards and towards the pole , with an increased risk of extinction .
