but just because we love it does n't mean that all breads are created equal -- while some we could eat by the loaf , others just do n't live up our expectations . to highlight which breads are worth buying and which you should probably stay away from , we 've ranked the top 20 breads in order -- according to our extremely subjective opinion . if ( and when ) you disagree with where we put your favorite bread , let us know your gripes in the comments .  ( to clarify , the requirements for eligibility were leavened breads that come in loaf form . and this is the opinion of one writer , not huffpost taste as an entity . )  20  ezekiel  flickr : motherawesome  this sprouted grain bread is made without the sugar present in most other breads , which warrants critiques of an " absolutely horrid " texture and taste reminiscent of " butt-wiped cardboard . "  19  white  getty  processed , bleached and bland .  18  pullman loaf remarkably rectangular this bread comes out .  17  cinnamon raisin  getty  love the cinnamon , hate the raisins .  16  olive bread  getty  this one 's pretty straight-forward : if you like olives , you 'll like olive bread , and if you do n't you wo n't .  15  wheat  getty  better than white bread , but still kind of a bore .  14  potato bread  flickr : nostepinne  part wheat flour , part potatoes . all softer and tastier than regular bread .  13  multigrain  getty  this hearty loaf is packed full of seeds and grains -- great for your health , horrible for keeping your teeth seed-free .  12  italian  shutterstock  classic , but not particularly exciting .  11  brioche  getty  this bread is sweet , rich and perfect for things like bread pudding and french toast . we suspect it 's the large quantities of butter that go into making it .  10  french baguette  getty eating fresh french baguettes and butter .  9  focaccia  shutterstock  this flat italian bread is just as great for sandwich breads as it is plain , dipped in balsamic vinegar and olive oil .  8  challah  getty  this jewish bread is very similar to brioche , but made with oil instead of butter as well as more eggs .  7  ciabatta  getty  this flat italian bread is a staple for making panini , so obviously we 're big fans .  6  marble rye  flickr : trupastilla  this marble loaf is made by rolling light and dark ryes together .  5  boule  getty  again , the french get it right when it comes to bread -- this round rustic roll is one of the best to make at home .  4  rye bread  getty  our sandwiches would be nowhere without this classic loaf .  3  pumpernickel  getty  this bread got an almost unanimous vote from the huffpost taste and food teams .
