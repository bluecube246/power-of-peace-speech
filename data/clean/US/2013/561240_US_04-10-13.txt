<p> But just because we love it does n't mean that all breads are created equal -- while some we could eat by the loaf , others just do n't live up our expectations . To highlight which breads are worth buying and which you should probably stay away from , we 've ranked the top 20 breads in order -- according to our extremely subjective opinion . If ( and when ) you disagree with where we put your favorite bread , let us know your gripes in the comments . <p> ( To clarify , the requirements for eligibility were leavened breads that come in loaf form . And this is the opinion of one writer , not HuffPost Taste as an entity . ) <p> 20 <p> Ezekiel <p> Flickr : motherAWESOME <p> This sprouted grain bread is made without the sugar present in most other breads , which warrants critiques of an " absolutely horrid " texture and taste reminiscent of " butt-wiped cardboard . " <p> 19 <p> White <p> Getty <p> Processed , bleached and bland . <p> 18 <p> Pullman Loaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably rectangular this bread comes out . <p> 17 <p> Cinnamon Raisin <p> Getty <p> Love the cinnamon , hate the raisins . <p> 16 <p> Olive Bread <p> Getty <p> This one 's pretty straight-forward : if you like olives , you 'll like olive bread , and if you do n't you wo n't . <p> 15 <p> Wheat <p> Getty <p> Better than white bread , but still kind of a bore . <p> 14 <p> Potato Bread <p> Flickr : Nostepinne <p> Part wheat flour , part potatoes . All softer and tastier than regular bread . <p> 13 <p> Multigrain <p> Getty <p> This hearty loaf is packed full of seeds and grains -- great for your health , horrible for keeping your teeth seed-free . <p> 12 <p> Italian <p> Shutterstock <p> Classic , but not particularly exciting . <p> 11 <p> Brioche <p> Getty <p> This bread is sweet , rich and perfect for things like bread pudding and French Toast . We suspect it 's the large quantities of butter that go into making it . <p> 10 <p> French Baguette <p> Getty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating fresh French baguettes and butter . <p> 9 <p> Focaccia <p> Shutterstock <p> This flat Italian bread is just as great for sandwich breads as it is plain , dipped in balsamic vinegar and olive oil . <p> 8 <p> Challah <p> Getty <p> This Jewish bread is very similar to brioche , but made with oil instead of butter as well as more eggs . <p> 7 <p> Ciabatta <p> Getty <p> This flat Italian bread is a staple for making panini , so obviously we 're big fans . <p> 6 <p> Marble Rye <p> Flickr : trupastilla <p> This marble loaf is made by rolling light and dark ryes together . <p> 5 <p> Boule <p> Getty <p> Again , the French get it right when it comes to bread -- this round rustic roll is one of the best to make at home . <p> 4 <p> Rye Bread <p> Getty <p> Our sandwiches would be nowhere without this classic loaf . <p> 3 <p> Pumpernickel <p> Getty <p> This bread got an almost unanimous vote from the HuffPost Taste and Food teams .
