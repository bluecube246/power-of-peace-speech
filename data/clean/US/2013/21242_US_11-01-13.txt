<h> Ask Ars : Does Facebook auto-delete content after a certain period of time ? <h> Ars reader wants to create a page for an ancestor , but worries about losing content . <p> In 1998 , Ask Ars was an early feature of the newly launched Ars Technica . Now , as then , it 's all about your questions and our community 's answers . We occasionally dig into our question bag , provide our own take , then tap the wisdom of our readers . To submit your own question , see our helpful tips page . <p> I ask , because I want to use Facebook to create a historical timeline about an ancestor in my family so people can learn more about their heritage . I have Googled my question several times and all answers are confusing and mixed : some say everything stays on a FB page until you clean it off and others say Facebook deletes status updates and photos monthly . <p> This is an interesting way to use Facebook -- to create a page for someone who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . ( Typically , the question is the other way around : what to do with someone 's existing Facebook account after they pass away ? ) And given the level of confusion constantly floating around about Facebook 's data retention policies , it 's no surprise that it might be hard to pinpoint exactly when ( if ever ) information gets deleted from the social network . <p> We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others , including those described above . Typically , information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted . For certain categories of data , we may also tell you about specific data retention practices . <p> Just to be sure , we reached out to Facebook to confirm this is indeed the policy for the above use case . The company confirmed that as long as you have not deleted the content yourself -- or in the case of a message between two people , both people have not deleted it -- the content should stay online indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in mind about this policy . If you ever do want to delete the content , you should know that it 's not likely to disappear instantly . As you may remember , we followed a thread for several years over how fast photos are deleted from Facebook 's servers once you delete them from the site ; as of late 2012 , we verified that photos indeed appear to be removed within 30 days of deletion ( our tests showed they were actually removed much faster ) . <p> It 's not just about photos , though . As outlined in the same Data Use Policy referenced above , there are major differences between deactivating an account versus deleting an account , should you choose to eventually remove the account you created for your ancestor . Many Facebook users mistakenly think that deactivating their accounts equals deletion , but that is not so : <p> Deactivating your account puts your account on hold . Other users will no longer see your timeline , but we do not delete any of your information . Deactivating an account is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future . You can deactivate your account on your account settings page . <p> Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated . <p> So when you deactivate your ancestor 's account , it 's not really going anywhere . The data is still there , lurking somewhere on Facebook 's servers , even if the " friends " of that account can no longer see it . <p> Deletion , however , is another matter : <p> When you delete an account , it is permanently deleted from Facebook . It typically takes about one month to delete an account , but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days . You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it . <p> ... <p> Certain information is needed to provide you with services , so we only delete this information after you delete your account . Some of the things you do on Facebook are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group or sending someone a message ( where your friend may still have a message you sent , even after you delete your account ) . That information remains after you delete your account . <p> I often see Facebook users confusing these two things . They usually become alarmed when they 've deactivated an account , only to have all the old information show up again when they go to " register " a new account . But if you actually go through with a real deletion , the information should n't be there past 90 days -- and hopefully it will be gone sooner .
