that 's what they say : dialect society chooses its words of the year  for this week 's edition of " that 's what they say , " university of michigan professor anne curzan spoke with us from boston , where she was attending the american dialect society 's annual meeting , whose 200 members voted on their " word of the year . "  rina miller : so the winner is ?  anne : the winner is " hashtag . " it was a surprise entry . it was nominated from the floor . i must admit , i went in thinking " fiscal cliff " had this hands down . i thought there was no way anything would beat that , but fiscal cliff did n't even make the runoff . it was hashtag vs. marriage equality .  rina : why hashtag ?  anne : the argument was that while the word hashtag has been around since 2007 , this was the year of the hashtag . this was the year that hashtag was everywhere in the twittersphere and beyond , making memes go viral .  rina : and what were the winners in some of the other categories ?  anne : marriage equality , which was in the runoff for word of the year , actually won most likely to succeed . and i thought it was a very interesting entry . the argument was that as the country has changed its attitudes about marriage equality , we 've seen the terminology shift from same-sex marriage or gay marriage to marriage equality . and people pointed out that when textbooks write this up as a movement , it will be about the movement for marriage equality .  rina : tell us about some of the other categories .  anne : one of my favorites , most years , is the most creative word of the year . and there were two terrific candidates this year . one is " mansplaining , " which is defined as a man 's condescending explanation to a female audience . it 's designed to capture a certain kind of male behavior . it did mean that during the discussion of talking because they could easily be accused of mansplaining every time they tried to say anything , even though it was a mixed-gender audience .  rina : that 's never happened to me , has it to you , anne ?  anne : no , never .  the mansplaining was up against " gate lice " -- a description of passengers on an airplane who crowd around the gate waiting to board .  rina : i love that !  anne : i loved it , too , and i particularly liked the singular , which is gate louse .  rina : and who does n't know that ? maybe we 've even been a louse .  anne : and now we have such a great way to talk about it . we can say , " look at all the gate lice . "  rina : there 's also the most unnecessary and the most outrageous categories . those are more serious .  anne : they are more serious . and this year the same phrase won in both categories . it senate candidate todd akins . and someone pointed out when we were voting for most unnecessary , that it came up again under most outrageous on the ballot . and someone yelled out , " it should win both . " and it did .  rina : and which word was least likely to succeed ?  anne : that was a tie . one of the first i remember . it was a tie between " yolo , " which our listeners over about 25 or 30 may be less familiar with . it is an acronym for " you only live once . " it came to prominence this year from the rapper , drake . he had a song in which he talked about you only live once -- yolo -- and i think there are a number of young people who got yolo tattoos , which they are going to come to regret , because students tell me it is already very unhip .  yolo tied with " phablet , " which is apparently a mid-sized electronic device between a smart phone and a tablet anne : for the most useful , we had two combining forms . " pocalypse " or " mageddon , " which you 'll hear people attach to things like " snowmaggedon " or " oilpocalypse " to describe a huge oil spill as a hyperbolic way to talk about a catastrophe .  rina : there had to be something that came out of the elections .  anne : the election phrase of the year is " binders full of women . " after presidential candidate mitt romney said that , it instantly became a hashtag , and many people have probably seen it circulating online . it beat " 47 percent , " which was also up for word of the year . so both 47 percent and " fiscal cliff " did n't win anything .
