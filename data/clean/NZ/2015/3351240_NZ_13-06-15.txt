Air quality hearings to start again in Invercargill  Hearings on proposed changes to air quality rules will start again in Invercargill on Monday .  The proposed rules in the Environment Southland air plan affect which burners can be used for home heating , what can and can not be burnt as fuel and implement restrictions for outdoor burning , agrichemicals and fertilisers and fire training .  A prohibition on open fires was planned to come into effect from September , however Environment Southland staff have recommended extending that deadline to January 1 , 2016 and also pushing back the phase out of solid fuel fires from January 2016 to January 1 , 2017 .  Two days of hearings have already been held in Gore .  At those , held two weeks ago , the Gore District Council attacked Environment Southland for lumping Invercargill and Gore airsheds together in its proposed Regional Air Plan , while residents and other groups also submitted that low-income families and elderly residents would be left " miserable and shivering " if Environment Southland proceeded with its proposed down for four days and will be held at the Environment Southland offices on the corner of North Rd and Price St.  At least 39 submitters are expected to give submissions over the four days , including the Invercargill City Council , Venture Southland , Fonterra , Alliance , Airways Corporation , the Education Ministry , and Horticulture NZ .  The hearings begin at 10am each day .  Changes in the Regional Air Plan partly reflect government expectations outlined in the National Environmental Standards for Air Quality which say Gore must not exceed PM10 standards more than once by September 1 , 2016 , and Invercargill must not exceed more than three times by September 1 , 2016 and no more than once by 2020.
