<h> Opposition to camp ground contract plan <p> Private management of Waitaki lakes camping areas has been strongly opposed in submissions made to the Waitaki District Council . <p> Last year , the council produced a draft Waitaki Lakes Camping Areas Management Plan which put forward several proposals , including long-term contracts or leasing to private providers for up to 21 years camping areas at Parsons Rock , Boat Harbour , Loch Laird and the Wildlife Reserve as one group , Ohau C and Falstone as the second and Sailors Cutting on its own . <p> That was put out for public submissions in November , closing on January 23 , along with other issues such as Waitaki ratepayers subsidising campers ' activity by between $25,000 and $125,000 each year . <p> The council received 158 submissions , 60% of them from campers , 14% from day users and others from a variety of people . <p> Of those making submissions , 70% were from outside the Waitaki district . <p> The most contentious proposal in the plan was leasing out the camping areas , with almost 59% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to that proposal included a lack of financial information on costs of running the camps , concern with likely fee increases and losing the ' ' kiwi-style ' ' camping atmosphere . <p> Six submissions opposed ratepayers subsidising camping , while another six pointed out other amenities and activities were subsidised . <p> Overall , those opposing changes emphasised they wanted the status quo kept with an undeveloped environment that had basic amenities - good , well-maintained toilets , a water supply and rubbish removal . <p> There was strong support for ' ' user pays ' ' fees for boat ramps , effluent dumping stations and other facilities at the reserves . <p> That was supported by about 70% of submitters , with 16.5% opposed . <p> However , 12 submitters asked why there had been no maintenance or improvements to boat ramps given the fees the council was already collecting , the same number emphasising the fees had to be fair and go back into the ramps . <p> The two most popular camping areas based on the submission returns were Falstone ( 24% ) and Sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahuriri arms respectively of Lake Benmore . <p> Ohau C ( 14% ) and Loch Laird ( 13% ) , both also on Lake Benmore , were the next popular . <p> Some submitters had long histories of camping around the lakes , some for 40 years or more . <p> On Wednesday , the council 's community services committee will hear from 14 submitters speaking to their submissions , and consider the others .
