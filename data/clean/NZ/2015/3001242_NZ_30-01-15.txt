community good still drives philanthropist  as he prepared for his 70th birthday bash yesterday , queenstown investor and philanthropist sir eion edgar has good news : ' ' i 'm not slowing down . ' '  it is good news because , after relocating from dunedin in december 2003 , sir eion has already left a significant mark in town .  without his readiness to part with substantial money , queenstown resort college and the winter games would not have got off the ground .  and the queenstown trails trust could have struggled to raise money to complete its 110km network of cycling/walking trails around the wakatipu .  the founder and longtime chairman of sharebroking firm forsyth barr , who has bounced back from double knee replacement surgery in october , said he was approached by educator jan fitz-gerald to finance qrc in early 2003 .  at the time he was still the dunedin-based chancellor of the university of otago .  sir eion said he first sought approval from the university 's council to pursue the project once he retired no conflict , delighted you 'll do it ' . ' '  after eventually finding land for a building , the college opened for classes in 2006 .  ' ' it has n't been easy . it 's cost a lot of money , but it 's been one of the best things for queenstown .  ' ' it 's not seasonal - the kids are there 50 weeks a year - and it adds real value to all aspects of tourism . ' '  the queenstown and wanaka-based winter games , meanwhile , were the knight 's own brainwave , when he was president of the new zealand olympic committee .  he said the united states olympic committee was discussing a summer games for pacific rim countries when he said to his secretary-general , barry maister : ' ' why do n't we have a winter games , because all of these other countries are in the northern hemisphere . ' '  after a feasibility study by current chief executive arthur klap , the games have been run every two years since 2009 . crisis , was particularly tough but , as with qrc , sir eion has happily bankrolled the games , because he believes in them .  ' ' it has a huge multiplier effect in promoting the queenstown-wanaka region and giving young new zealand athletes the opportunity to perform . ' '  sir eion said his trails trust involvement arose after he was invited to go on a tramp with a local walking group .  ' ' a lovely guy called cliff broad said , eion , can you help us ? i 've got involved with this wakatipu trails trust and it 's going nowhere . would you be prepared to become the patron and back it ? ' ' '  as he and his wife jan , lady edgar , were keen walkers , he readily accepted .  subsequently , along with chief executive kaye parker , he played a leading role in the campaign to raise $6 million to complete the trail network .  he said the trust was also fortunate it got government support to join the nz cycle trail network . time to ' ' raising money for good causes ' ' , says : ' ' i learnt from the early days that if you put your own money up first , it makes it a lot easier to then ask others . ' '  he is also a regular bidder in local charity auctions - the back of his garage is packed with items he did not want ' ' but the auction was a bit dull ' ' .  coming from dunedin , whose people , he quips , have very short hands and long pockets , he says queenstown has a very generous community .  ' ' there 's people who could do more but also there 's an awful lot of people that go out of their way .  ' ' to get 200 patrons for the winter games , 90% of them from queenstown , just demonstrates the generosity . ' '  he has also never come across a more positive community .  ' ' the wonderful thing about queenstown is 98% of the people who live here were n't here .  ' ' they 're then determined to prove they were right to make that decision , so you get this enormous enthusiasm . ' '
