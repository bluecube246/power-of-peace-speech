<h> Megaquake could hit central New Zealand <p> Scientists finally have proof that central New Zealand could be ticking down to a highly damaging " megathrust " earthquake . <p> Mark Cornell <p> The study area was salt marsh flats on the edge of Big Lagoon near Blenheim <p> Earlier research has suggested the seabed between the Wairarapa and Marlborough is capable of generating magnitude 7-plus quakes . <p> Now researchers have found solid geological evidence that an area off the coast of Wairarapa and fringing Cook Strait causes " megathrust " quakes and tsunami similar to , but probably smaller than , the devastating magnitude 9.0 March 2011 event in Japan . <p> To look for evidence of past earthquakes on the margin , the researchers performed a painstaking examination of the geologic layers contained within a salt marsh at Big Lagoon in the southeastern Wairau River valley on South Island . <p> The work , out Tuesday morning , highlights the active threat the southern Hikurangi margin - where the Pacific Plate is being dragged down below the Australian Plate - poses to life and livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marlborough . <p> The Alpine Fault , which extends further south from that plate boundary , is also a hazardous feature that will generate a magnitude 8 quake when it ruptures , possibly some time in the next 50 to 100 years . <p> The scientists , from GNS Science , the University of Texas and Geomarine Research , have calculated that in the past 1000 years two subduction quakes of at least magnitude 7 occurred -- one between about 880 to 800 years ago and the other between 520 and 470 years ago . <p> Philip Carthew <p> A map showing the area when the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates collide . Researchers warn a ' megaquake ' of magnitude 8 or more could occur in this area . <p> " This is the first evidence that the southern Hikurangi margin ruptures in large ( 7-7.9 ) to great ( 8+ ) earthquakes , and the relatively short time interval between the two events has significant implications for seismic hazard in New Zealand , " they said in Tuesday 's Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.9 Hikurangi subduction quake , losses in the Wellington region alone were estimated to be about $13 billion , with about 3550 deaths and 7000 injuries . <p> Kate Clark , GNS Science <p> Jamie Howarth , William Ries and Delia Strong , of GNS Science , using a piston corer to recover sediment cores from salt marsh at Big Lagoon , Blenheim , to determine the dates of the last megathrust earthquake off the Wairarapa coast . <p> Their findings would allow better modelling of the impacts and help communities prepare to cope with such an event , they said . <p> The Hikurangi margin , which runs from east of East Cape to offshore of the Marlborough coast , is one of the few subduction zones around the Pacific that has not generated a " great " , above magnitude 8 , quake in historic times . <p> Data shows that in the southern Hikurangi margin the Australian and Pacific plates are locked and accumulating strain where they meet , about 25km beneath Wellington and Blenheim . <p> Previous research suggests this locked patch between Cook Strait and Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude . <p> In their search for subduction-quake evidence , the researchers used a salt marsh on the edge of Big Lagoon near Blenheim to recover sediment that could be aged by radiocarbon dating . <p> They collected 48 sediment cores , from 0.5m to 2.2m deep . Analysis and dating of the buried soils in the cores showed there had been two occasions of sudden subsidence of the lagoon in the past 1000 years , indicative of two large quakes . <p> The older event was accompanied by a tsunami at least 3.3m high that swept more than 360m inland . <p> There was no evidence of a tsunami hitting Big Lagoon in the more recent quake , although there were tsunami deposits around Cook Strait , at Abel Tasman and on Kapiti Island about the same time as that event , researchers said . <p> Lead researcher Dr Kate Clark , of GNS Science , said the findings did not greatly change the actual level of risk to people in central New Zealand . <p> The National Seismic Hazard Model used a recurrence interval of 550 to 1000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual interval of about 350 years between the two quakes . <p> While that was different , it was not an irreconcilable difference , given the average was only based on two events .
