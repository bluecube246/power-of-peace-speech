5 reasons why this desert race is so different  photographer craig kolesky took a weatherproof f-stop bag full of camera kit to a remote location to shoot a bizarre downhill race between freeskier fabio studer and mountain biker oliver munnik . see the stunning result in the above clip shot by anton nelson ( and kolesky 's money shot at redbullphotography.com ) and read on for why this is a bit of an unusual project to say the least .  1 . for a start , it 's mtb vs skiing in the same race  when have you ever seen a mountain biker take on a skier ? " originally we thought we might have someone sandboarding down a volcano , but i was thinking , ' no , we can do better than that ! ' " says kolesky . " so we came up with this idea of having two guys from totally different sports matched against each other in a location that 's completely different to anywhere they 'd usually be . " when there 's no conventional hill anywhere that have to find some kind of other location where this is possible . so ...  2 . it took place on a remote namibian sand dune  ok , so most desert races involve some kind of remoteness -- city marathons they are n't -- but hundreds of kilometres from major civilisation ? " we shot at meob bay , which is about 260km south of the nearest town , walvis bay , " recalls kolesky . " the only way to get there is by 4x4 and with a team of professional drivers and guides . there are a handful of people who can get the right permits to shoot there , and we managed to get the perfect group of guides -- an awesome team who got us right out into the dunes . "  3 . the ocean was a big factor  though it was an arid african desert , the location of the shoot in the namib desert was accessed via the coast , and this produced a unique logistical problem . " there 's a 100m stretch , where the dunes meet the kolesky of the route out to the location . " we had to wait four hours for the tide to go down far enough for us to pass . "  related stories  4 . producing an equal battleground takes practice  ok , so you want a race , but you want a fair one -- and a photographer like craig kolesky needs both racers in shot ! so when one guy is too fast and the other too slow , you have a problem ... " on his first test run he absolutely flew down this dune , and had to really dig in to slow himself down for the photo , " says kolesky of studer . " at the bottom he just had this massive smile on his face , as if to say , ' yeah , this is going to work ! ' " and munnik ? we quickly learned that we had to get his tyre pressure exactly right for him to roll properly down the dunes -- taking into account the density of the sand and the direction of the slope , more quickly than you think  -- craig kolesky  5 . this desert has killer fog  mist rolling in off the sea in north frisia or creeping over a tyrolean alp is something a german mountain biker or austrian skier might be led to expect , but fog on an african sand dune ? " it 's a very hostile place to be . it 's hot in the middle of the day and very cold at all other times , " says kolesky . " it 's also very windy , which kicks up the sand . plus , fog can roll in quickly and completely disorient you . the desert can kill you more quickly than you think . "
