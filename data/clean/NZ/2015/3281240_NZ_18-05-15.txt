Capcom : Remasters ' Will Be One of Our Key Business Activities '  Developer and publisher Capcom has revealed that one of their " key business activities " going forward will be HD remasters of older games , like this year 's Resident Evil and Devil May Cry 4 re-releases .  " HD remasters of our catalogue hit titles will be one of our key business activities , " a representative for Capcom said during a Q&amp;A session at their latest financial briefing .  " Overseas , it is becoming difficult to sell these lower-priced and re-mastered titles at stores because of the declining number of stores and sales area limitations . Therefore , we started aggressive digital download sales activities , " they continued .  " These activities created new demand for these titles . For example , overseas download sales of ' Resident Evil ' ( HD Remastered ) in the past fiscal year were far higher than we expected . It is not a risk but rather the growth of the download sales channel gives users more options . We for more people to enjoy our games .

DmC Devil May Cry : Definitive Edition came out in March , and Devil May Cry 4 : Special Edition is due out next month .  Capcom has an extensive catalogue of games and franchises to draw on for remasters , like Resident Evil , Street Fighter , Devil May Cry , and Onimusha .
