"  in october , the literary community in featherston hosted their first booktown festival ( image above from this ) , offering a host of literary events and workshops . it was a great success and gained the community national media attention . for more , see : www.booktown.org.nz .  stretching along the city 's picturesque waterfront -- essentially bookmarking wellington 's urban land-and-seascapes -- the walk comprises 23 sculptural quotations from some of new zealand 's best-known writers . these typographical statements are expressed in concrete plaques and inlaid metal text on wooden ' benchmarks ' , and appear in intriguing , often surprising places as you wander past . these sculptural tributes -- the work of renowned typographer catherine griffiths and award-winning architect fiona christeller -- celebrate the place of wellington in these writers ' lives , and their place in the life of wellington .  i talked to tilly from unity she said that they become " part of the buzz of the city , feeding into the character and atmosphere ; they also create a useful background noise . " imagine reading poet bill manhire 's immortal words : i live at the edge of the universe , like everybody else on a concrete plaque as you skirt wellington 's waterfront , and not be moved to want to read more . rhetorical .  dynamic christchurch and their new literary trail lively and dynamic , christchurch is a literary and arts hub par excellence . hosting every kind of literary event and festival imaginable , not least the annual christchurch arts festival , biannual word christchurch and world buskers festival , you 'd be crazy to miss out on the array of talent on offer year-on-year .  the meandering and ambitious re-build in central christchurch has created an opportunity for the creation of a literary trail along the banks of the avon river . taking the form of installation panels , each work contains excerpts by the following prominent authors : sir apirana taylor , john deans , wiremu about christchurch 's newest installation , hon nicky wagner , associate minister for canterbury earthquake recovery , said " the words are etched onto the steps that lead down to the river 's edge , celebrating both the avon river and christchurch 's rich literary history . these are the first works in a series of literary sculptures that will be installed down the length of the avon river precinct 's promenade . " what 's not to love !  unesco city of literature , dunedinfor the past year , dunedin has been basking in the fact that it is new zealand 's only city to be designated a unesco creative city of literature . such an accolade has doubtless spurred cultural tourism for dunedin , a city already known for its vast cultural heritage , and for the reputation it has for nurturing literary talent . dunedin was the first city in new zealand to initiate a writer 's fellowship and today considerable support is provided to many writers through the multitude of awards , competitions and residencies on offer . and then there 's the arts festival dunedin spoke to bronwyn from the university bookshop ( above ) about whether dunedin 's status as a unesco creative city of literature had made a difference to them and if so , how . describing uni books as the " sitting room of unesco , with strong connections to local writers and illustrators , " bronwyn said " being named as a unesco creative city of literature was a huge coup and one that had really put dunedin on the map . now , we have networks with fellow unesco cities and can share ideas .  locally , it had raised awareness of literature and dunedin 's local luminaries . "  whether you are venturing north or south , there is always an excuse to venture out into the literary landscape while on holiday this year . happy literary trails !  by sarah thornton , thornton communications  - if you find yourself between christchurch and dunedin , oamaru is home to janet frame house , maintained by the janet frame eden street trust .
