Artisan chocolate hits Hamilton 's shelves  Whittaker 's new Artisan chocolate is a hit with some . Six new flavours in the New Zealand collection released Monday .  Some people like to relax with a cup of tea while other reach for a delicious bar of chocolate .  Now , thanks to Whittaker 's new Artisan Collection and Waikato 's Zealong tea , people can enjoy both at the same time .  Waikato-based chocoholics and tea-fanatics should be intrigued by the fusion of Zealong 's Oolong Tea in Whittaker 's 50 per cent dark chocolate .  The 100g blocks stand proudly covered in regal green and gold packaging , with a pattern that features New Zealand themed pictures , like the Kiwi and silver fern , next to steaming teapots and sailing ships .  As you open the packet , the delicate spices of the tea waft through your senses but quickly simmer down once the smooth cocoa has reached your lips .  With every piece , the taste of the tea gets weaker and weaker , as your tongue taste Whittaker 's dark chocolate is praised for .  As the chocolate disappears , you are left with a taste not dissimilar to emptying a weak tea bag into your mouth - if you 're a tea fan it is n't offensive , but definitely a little dry .  Zealong tea , based on Gordonton Rd in Hamilton , is understood to be the world 's purest tea - you can trace the product from soil to cup .  Zealong International Sales Manager Sen Kong said New Zealand 's only commercial tea plantation was thrilled with the fusion .  " We 're excited about matching our lovingly nurtured , handpicked , certified organic tea with Whittaker 's dark chocolate , " he said . " It 's pure NZ at its best and something a little different that we think Kiwis will love . "
