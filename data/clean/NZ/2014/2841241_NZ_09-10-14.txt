" he is significantly upset and distraught at the harm . he has a significant burden to carry , " mr cook said .  before today , wu had already paid into the court trust account $15,000 for emotional harm reparation would n't fix all the harm he had caused , he hoped it would help in some small way .  it was fortunate there were no fatalities , said judge o'driscoll .  there had initially been " real concerns " as to whether mr chew would live , he said .  the judge had now seen a medical report which indicated he has suffered serious injuries that included a mild head injury .  he had 6-12 months of rehabilitation ahead of him , the court heard .  a victim impact statement from mr chew 's wife said he had undergone surgery and would require further surgery , with his recovery in the future still being " unknown " .  " it is obvious that he will face a very long recovery , " judge o'driscoll said .  ms coelho would " bear scars for a long time " and was unsure over the future of her job , the judge said .
