<h> Car crash pilot ordered to pay compensation <p> A pilot who ran a stop sign during a Lord of the Rings sightseeing road-trip and caused a car crash that seriously injured colleagues has today been ordered by a judge to pay $10,000 compensation to both victims . <p> At his sentencing in Christchurch District Court today he was also banned from driving for 18 months . <p> He was with four other airline colleagues in a rental car when he ran a stop sign and hit a four wheel-drive towing a horse float at an intersection near Rolleston , south of Christchurch , last Wednesday morning . <p> Singapore Airlines chief steward Chew Weng Wai was a backseat passenger and not wearing a seatbelt when Wu failed to notice a stop sign . <p> He managed to slow down to about 40-50km/h . <p> But he later told police he did n't want to make an abrupt stop , because it would 've been " uncomfortable " for his passengers . <p> The horse float , which had been travelling at 80km/h , braked heavily but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side took the brunt of the impact and he had to be cut free of the wreck . <p> He suffered bleeding and swelling to the brain as well as significant internal bleeding . <p> Steward Vanessa Leonara Savio Coelho , seated in the middle of the back seat , also was n't wearing a seatbelt . <p> She had to be cut free by rescuers and underwent surgery the following day for injuries that included a fractured arm and shattered pelvis as well as spleen and bladder injuries . <p> Today at Christchurch District Court , defence counsel Kerry Cook described the incident as a " tragic unintended accident with tragic consequences " . <p> In what Mr Cook said was " a cruel twist " , Wu was n't meant to drive that day but was the only one up when the rental car arrived . <p> He was driving on an unfamiliar road , taking directions with others from the GPS system , and had not been speeding , Mr Cook said . <p> Wu saw the stop sign " very late " and " made a split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The injuries to those not wearing seatbelts were " horrendous " , Mr Cook accepted . <p> Judge Stephen O'Driscoll noted that it was " perhaps ironic " that there was not injury to those wearing seatbelts . <p> He said that it would have been " prudent " for Wu as the driver to ensure his passengers were all wearing seatbelts . <p> But as Mr Cook outlined , there is no legal responsibility on the driver of a car to ensure passengers aged 15 and over to wear seatbelts . <p> Mr Wu , largely uninjured , tried to help his workmates at the scene and immediately acknowledged his wrongdoing . <p> He is genuinely remorseful , Mr Cook said , and has apologised face-to-face to Ms Coelho and Mr Chew 's wife who " do n't hold any grudges against him " . <p> " He is significantly upset and distraught at the harm . He has a significant burden to carry , " Mr Cook said . <p> Before today , Wu had already paid into the court trust account $15,000 for emotional harm reparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't fix all the harm he had caused , he hoped it would help in some small way . <p> It was fortunate there were no fatalities , said Judge O'Driscoll . <p> There had initially been " real concerns " as to whether Mr Chew would live , he said . <p> The judge had now seen a medical report which indicated he has suffered serious injuries that included a mild head injury . <p> He had 6-12 months of rehabilitation ahead of him , the court heard . <p> A victim impact statement from Mr Chew 's wife said he had undergone surgery and would require further surgery , with his recovery in the future still being " unknown " . <p> " It is obvious that he will face a very long recovery , " Judge O'Driscoll said . <p> Ms Coelho would " bear scars for a long time " and was unsure over the future of her job , the judge said .
