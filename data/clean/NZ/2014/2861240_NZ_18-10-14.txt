storm over ' piss-take ' liquor logo  relevant offers  liquorland 's new slogan " all the help you need " has been labelled " a piss-take " and " cynical " by addiction support agencies concerned at the company 's choice of wording .  recently liquorland changed its slogan from " here 's to you " to " all the help you need " .  the new slogan has drawn intense criticism from a range of support agencies questioning liquorland 's intentions behind the slogan .  liquorland chief executive rob gibson said the " help " in the slogan refers to its employees ' commitment to service and knowledge of brands it stocks .  its previous slogan " here 's to you " felt very masculine and may have alienated some customers , he said . liquorland dropped the old slogan and adopted " all the help you need " following guidance from its advertising agency .  alcohol drug association of new zealand chief executive paul rout said liquorland 's use of the word " help " in the new to alcohol-related problems in new zealand is the easy of access to cheap liquor through off-licence retailers .  " they should stop using that word because i think it 's a contradiction in terms of what they actually do , " rout said .  the slogan features the kind of wording typically used by support agencies trying to help problem drinkers and minimise the alcohol harm , he said .  " it 's buying into a language and a concept that people warm to but in fact is n't genuine or real . "  the liquor industry has long promoted alcohol as something which can " help " people , whether it be in relation to relaxing , being socially popular or having improved sexual prowess , he said .  " of course , we never hear the downsides . "  new zealand drug foundation executive director ross bell said it was " a cynical slogan which suggests that booze is all the help you need " .  " it 's a bit of a piss-take i reckon , " bell said .  and it undermined the work of alcohol addiction support services , he said .  " it 's almost saying , keep drinking . it 's a very strange choice of phrase . "  people with alcohol dependency find it challenging being exposed to advertising and messaging associated with alcohol , he said .  " their slogan does send the message that alcohol is actually the answer to all of your problems .  " liquorland needs to probably rethink their slogan in light of that . "  alcohol action new zealand medical spokesman professor doug sellman said the slogan gave the impression liquorland was attempting to solve a customer 's problem .  " i suspect they are focusing on the lack of intoxication being the problem , " sellman said . " this sounds like alcoholism to me . "  alcohol marketing usually promoted alcohol consumption without any mention about its downside , he said .  " marketing is very clever and it is maintaining the heavy drinking culture . that 's what 's really insidious about the promotion of alcohol . "  an unusual choice and not a phrase people would immediately associate with a liquor outlet .  the saying " all the help you need " would usually be associated with a place that provides a helpful service , he said .  " if you need help for something you would n't think ' i 'll go to my local liquor store ' , " thirkell said .  if liquorland built a communication campaign explaining the slogan it would make the message more clear , he said . while the slogan was not outrageous , it would be contentious considering the concern around alcohol use in society , he said .  " i do n't think it 's shocking or a travesty . "  gibson said liquorland appreciated the alcohol support agencies ' point of view and liquorland was committed to meeting and exceeding its responsibilities as a liquor retailer .
