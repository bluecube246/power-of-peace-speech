<h> Storm over ' piss-take ' liquor logo <h> Relevant offers <p> Liquorland 's new slogan " all the help you need " has been labelled " a piss-take " and " cynical " by addiction support agencies concerned at the company 's choice of wording . <p> Recently Liquorland changed its slogan from " here 's to you " to " all the help you need " . <p> The new slogan has drawn intense criticism from a range of support agencies questioning Liquorland 's intentions behind the slogan . <p> Liquorland chief executive Rob Gibson said the " help " in the slogan refers to its employees ' commitment to service and knowledge of brands it stocks . <p> Its previous slogan " here 's to you " felt very masculine and may have alienated some customers , he said . Liquorland dropped the old slogan and adopted " all the help you need " following guidance from its advertising agency . <p> Alcohol Drug Association of New Zealand chief executive Paul Rout said Liquorland 's use of the word " help " in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alcohol-related problems in New Zealand is the easy of access to cheap liquor through off-licence retailers . <p> " They should stop using that word because I think it 's a contradiction in terms of what they actually do , " Rout said . <p> The slogan features the kind of wording typically used by support agencies trying to help problem drinkers and minimise the alcohol harm , he said . <p> " It 's buying into a language and a concept that people warm to but in fact is n't genuine or real . " <p> The liquor industry has long promoted alcohol as something which can " help " people , whether it be in relation to relaxing , being socially popular or having improved sexual prowess , he said . <p> " Of course , we never hear the downsides . " <p> New Zealand Drug Foundation executive director Ross Bell said it was " a cynical slogan which suggests that booze is all the help you need " . <p> " It 's a bit of a piss-take I reckon , " Bell said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it undermined the work of alcohol addiction support services , he said . <p> " It 's almost saying , keep drinking . It 's a very strange choice of phrase . " <p> People with alcohol dependency find it challenging being exposed to advertising and messaging associated with alcohol , he said . <p> " Their slogan does send the message that alcohol is actually the answer to all of your problems . <p> " Liquorland needs to probably rethink their slogan in light of that . " <p> Alcohol Action New Zealand medical spokesman Professor Doug Sellman said the slogan gave the impression Liquorland was attempting to solve a customer 's problem . <p> " I suspect they are focusing on the lack of intoxication being the problem , " Sellman said . " This sounds like alcoholism to me . " <p> Alcohol marketing usually promoted alcohol consumption without any mention about its downside , he said . <p> " Marketing is very clever and it is maintaining the heavy drinking culture . That 's what 's really insidious about the promotion of alcohol . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual choice and not a phrase people would immediately associate with a liquor outlet . <p> The saying " all the help you need " would usually be associated with a place that provides a helpful service , he said . <p> " If you need help for something you would n't think ' I 'll go to my local liquor store ' , " Thirkell said . <p> If Liquorland built a communication campaign explaining the slogan it would make the message more clear , he said . While the slogan was not outrageous , it would be contentious considering the concern around alcohol use in society , he said . <p> " I do n't think it 's shocking or a travesty . " <p> Gibson said Liquorland appreciated the alcohol support agencies ' point of view and Liquorland was committed to meeting and exceeding its responsibilities as a liquor retailer .
