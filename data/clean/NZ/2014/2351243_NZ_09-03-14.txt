Four myths about baby boomers

after reading some of the comments on stuff recently about the young generation 's perception of baby boomers i feel i have to state my case .  myth 1 : baby boomers were able to manage to live on one wage .  baby boomers , of which i am certainly one , did not stay home en-masse like some believe . i spent the 70s and 80s working with hundreds of other young mums out there working to get by .  myth 2 : education was free .  unless my parents lied to me , sorry , but i had to leave school at 15 simply because my parents could not afford to keep me at school . university was a dream and back then you actually had to pass your university entrance exam to get in .  myth 3 : housing was cheaper and there was government assistance to get your own home .  there was a scheme available that enabled families to cash in their family benefit ( the princely sum of $3 per week per child ) if before baby boomers were able to access it . baby boomers ' parents were the generation to get this , as well as a 3 per cent loan for life .  housing was and still is extremely expensive relative to income . there was no easy ride for baby boomers . if they did n't qualify for state advances loans they had to save with a bank for three years with a special housing account to prove they could afford to buy a home .  that home would be a modest three-bedroom , one-bathroom house with no garage , no fence , no drive , carpet , vinyl or drapes , and would be lucky to be 100 square metres . that would have been considered a huge home .  myth 4 : goods and food were much cheaper .  rubbish . food was expensive . mince and sausages were the staple diet of many baby-boomer families .  a new car ? most could only afford a secondhand car . you had to have a 50 per cent deposit to buy what were pretty rubbish cars , clothing , furniture , all goods that we now can access for relatively little money , cost a small fortune back then .  i would love to read a post from the few baby boomers out there that actually did get all the advantages the younger people seem to think we all had .  i know there are a few , but most baby boomers did nothing wrong . they went to work , they supported their families , they lived through the oil shocks of the 70s , and the restructuring and many redundancies of the 80s and 90s .  yet the younger generation seems to think we had it all . i wish .  we had to work , we had no subsidised childcare , maternity leave ( paid or otherwise ) , no working for families , no interest-free student loans and we certainly did not have low interest rates on our mortgages .
