<h> Leading the way <h> Transforming the lives of those less able <p> The Taranaki Disability Centre is set to celebrate their 30th anniversary . From left General Manager Brian Erikson &amp; Chairperson Kirsty Linnell . <h> Relevant offers <p> This week a special celebration will mark a major milestone in the life of an institution that has played a significant role in growing recognition of this country 's once forgotten tribe - the disabled . <p> It will be 30 years since a small group of organisations representing the disabled decided to co-operate in a bid to get a better deal for their members . <p> They moved into an old house in Young St , New Plymouth , and started the organisation that became the Taranaki Disabilities Information Centre ( TDIC ) . <p> Today that house is regional headquarters to eight organisations and TDIC has more than 60 affiliates and is transforming life and attitudes for its members . <p> In fact , such are its successes that Taranaki is leading the country in its care and recognition of the special needs of the disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre have won awards for their work in pushing strategies for needy members . <p> His greatest coup is in forging a disparate group of organisations into the Taranaki Disability Strategy coalition . In this , the region 's four local authorities , health board , appropriate government departments and disability organisations meet regularly to devise and implement an action plan to improve the lives of those with physical and mental handicaps . <p> Out of this has grown major developments in making the province more accessible in many respects . <p> Members work together separately and collectively to make life more inclusive for those they support . <p> A new bus service between Hawera and New Plymouth that runs both ways three times a day is a major achievement , but there are many others . <p> The Disability Action Group at Taranaki Base Hospital had a major contribution to making the new ward block there more accessible . It continues to improve on these significant achievements under the chairmanship of centre trust member , John Major . <p> TDIC adds to these achievements with an accredited training scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with sensory or mobility loss . <p> They wear blindfolds , ear muffs , and weights to simulate a stroke or are put in a wheelchair and made to travel familiar routes . <p> Trainees find the experience invaluable as well as being a fun way to learn lessons that hours reading or watching could not achieve . <p> " It is a matter of becoming aware through personal experience of many little things that make getting around so difficult for the disabled , " says Brian . His latest extension of this training is to incorporate it in a project to make Taranaki retail shops more accessible . <p> A TDIC survey has shown as many as a quarter of stores are not disabled friendly . Some are totally inaccessible . <p> The centre offers a free inspection and recommendations for improvements . Owners are also offered a place on the disability awareness training course . <p> " It is a win-win situation . The disabled get better access and the retailers encourage an extra one in four into their shops , " says Brian . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with costs covered from the Ministry of Social Development , Making a Difference Fund . <p> So far it has been welcomed by most retailers and the Chamber of Commerce . <p> Brian has plans to present an award to the most disabled friendly shop once inspections are completed . <p> Motivation for these developments have not just been good ideas from Brian and his board . <p> He spent more than a year in research , visiting towns and hamlets across the province talking to disabled people and finding their ideas for improvements . <p> Another request he has been able to make happen is a disaster kit prepared by the Red Cross , the centre and Civil Defence that provides advice to the less mobile on how to prepare and act during an emergency . <p> While all this has been going on the centre has continued its core operation providing advice to the disabled and educating the public on disability issues . <p> It has also expanded operations by offering equipment to assist the handicapped through sales or a hire scheme . <p> " Technology has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major beneficiaries of this change , " he says . <p> If the centre can not provide equipment it can tell people where to go for assistance . <p> He and staff monitor disabled- related changes by local authorities and health providers and co-ordinate the activities of affiliates . <p> It also initiates training and information activities <p> Centre trust chairwoman , Kirsty Linnell , says one secret of the organisation 's success has been its ability to co-operate and co-ordinate with others . <p> One of its most successful partnerships has been with New Plymouth District Council . As with other councils , the centre offers inspection and advice services using the building code and Be Accessible measures . The district council also played a major role in using Brian 's notes to draft the Taranaki Disability Strategy and its subsequent annual report that contains a full list of achievements . <p> Centre deputy chairman and former All Black , John Major , has been involved with the centre since he began mowing its lawns in the early 1990s . These days he is confined to a wheelchair by multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramps and public toilets are accessible . <p> He is also on a number of other committees and boards where his knowledge of the needs of the disabled is invaluable . <p> To find the beginning of this history go back more than 30 years , when Jack Nicholls ' family was running a pavilion on the west end of New Plymouth 's popular Ngamotu Beach and living in the family home in Young St. <p> He conceived the idea of a telephone answering service manned by disabled telephonist . Additions were made to the house , with an office and hall added to the front . <p> On the death of this polio sufferer the property was left to Parafed in New Plymouth . <p> Parafed was not well equipped to manage the building and asked the Barrett Homes Trust to assist with building administration but became one of the first tenants . The Parafed executive were aware of a Disabled Service Centre in Hamilton and after closer examination decided to emulate this operation and the idea of the Taranaki Disabled Living Centre was born . <p> This development is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worked together . <p> Barrett Homes was an idea promoted by former mayor Denny Sutherland , who became concerned at a lack of facilities for accidents victims and others with high care needs . <p> With aid of a board that included former architect , George Richardson , and newspaper manager , Rash Avery , six specially designed units were built in Barrett St. <p> Today 's trust chairman Brian Wray , says after taking over the centre it was improved and the number of tenants increased to operate along with the units . <p> A $187,000 grant from the TSB Community Trust in the mid- 2000s removed any debts remaining on the centre and it was handed over to the TDIC to manage . <p> Denny is not the only notable person involved with the centre . Former MP and mayor Harry Duynhoven has a long record and is now patron . Recent New Plymouth mayor Peter Tennent is another supporter . <p> The grant went to building extra units and Barrett Trust now has 15 of these in Inglewood and New Plymouth . Meanwhile Parafed formed the Taranaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer service continued for several years until overcome by technology , the centre operated from the hall and continued to grow . <p> An early and much respected manager , Ramona Rongonui , says things were pretty primitive in the early years . <p> " We operated out of the hall where the board room is now , " she says . <p> " The answering service was in the area the manager 's office is now . We provided information for the disabled and public . Public education was an important part of our work . We did a lot of public speaking . " She says that in recent years things have gone ahead in leaps and bounds . Brian has done a wonderful job . " <p> His association with the centre began as a tenant working as a contractor for ACC doing assessments of disabled people . <p> He took over from Ramona some 20 years ago and has worked tirelessly since . <p> All this will be celebrated with a function in the New Plymouth District Council chambers on Wednesday , October 22 . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre , with all tenants opening their rooms to show the public what they do . This will run from 10am to 2pm with the function at the council starting at 2.30pm.
