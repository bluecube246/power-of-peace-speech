manchester united vs . stoke city betting preview and pick  manchester united looks to maintain their strong form when they welcome stoke city to old trafford on tuesday .  manchester united will be looking to maintain their strong form when they welcome stoke city to old trafford on tuesday ( 2:45 p.m . et , nbc sports network ) .  louis van gaal 's men have now won three consecutive matches for the first time since he took over in the summer and are clear $1.40 favorites to make it four in a row here .  the potters ' 1-0 defeat at anfield on saturday was their fifth in the last eight games , and they are available at $7 odds to get back on track with a shock win in this one .  there has been just one draw in the last 21 meetings between these sides , but you can get odds of $4.40 on them cancelling each other out this time .  having put in a performance against hull that van gaal described as their best of the the dutchman 's team are really starting to click .  with their early teething problems now seemingly behind them , the red devils should be more than confident of extending their winning streak when they take on a team that have rarely caused them with too many problems in the past .  prior to february 's defeat at the britannia during the david moyes days , united had won 12 of the previous 13 matches against mark hughes ' side without suffering a single defeat , and a return to that form looks inevitable considering their guests ' current struggles .  not only does a 10th consecutive home win against these opponents look assured , the old trafford crowd should have plenty to cheer about in terms of goal as well , as six of the last seven encounters at this ground have reaped over 2.5 goals .
