Manchester United vs . Stoke City betting preview and pick  Manchester United looks to maintain their strong form when they welcome Stoke City to Old Trafford on Tuesday .  Manchester United will be looking to maintain their strong form when they welcome Stoke City to Old Trafford on Tuesday ( 2:45 p.m . ET , NBC Sports Network ) .  Louis Van Gaal 's men have now won three consecutive matches for the first time since he took over in the summer and are clear $1.40 favorites to make it four in a row here .  The Potters ' 1-0 defeat at Anfield on Saturday was their fifth in the last eight games , and they are available at $7 odds to get back on track with a shock win in this one .  There has been just one draw in the last 21 meetings between these sides , but you can get odds of $4.40 on them cancelling each other out this time .  Having put in a performance against Hull that Van Gaal described as their best of the the Dutchman 's team are really starting to click .  With their early teething problems now seemingly behind them , the Red Devils should be more than confident of extending their winning streak when they take on a team that have rarely caused them with too many problems in the past .  Prior to February 's defeat at the Britannia during the David Moyes days , United had won 12 of the previous 13 matches against Mark Hughes ' side without suffering a single defeat , and a return to that form looks inevitable considering their guests ' current struggles .  Not only does a 10th consecutive home win against these opponents look assured , the Old Trafford crowd should have plenty to cheer about in terms of goal as well , as six of the last seven encounters at this ground have reaped OVER 2.5 goals .
