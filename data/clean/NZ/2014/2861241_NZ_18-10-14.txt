http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/10629718/Face-Value-Al-Brown-on-money-matters

Al Brown grew up on a Wairarapa farm where his family grew their own vegetables , killed their own meat and were a long way from any shops .  Spending was a novelty . Brown still recalls the childhood thrill of being given five cents a day to buy a bag of lollies when on holiday at Castlepoint .  School holiday jobs revolved around the farm . As the only son , Brown was expected to take over the farm , but after one summer as a shepherd , he knew it was n't the life for him .  He worked in a food court , then in kitchens on his OE through Europe and finally put himself through one of the best culinary schools in the US .  " I loved kitchens . Everyone had a knife , there was fire everywhere , there was yelling and screaming . . . and beautiful plates of food came out the door . I found it quite mesmerising and very stimulating . "  Coming back to New Zealand , he set up his . The pair became even more well-known after getting their own bush travel and cooking show , Hunger for the Wild .  These days Brown is a brand , running The Depot eatery in Auckland , writing cook books , presenting television shows , and distributing food products .  What was your first paid job ?  My first job from an very early age was on the back of a horse at lambing time riding around the farm collecting dead lambs and putting them out at the gate each day , and getting a dollar a lamb for the pelts . My next paying job was while I was still at school , but in the summer holidays working in shearing gangs as an assistant presser .  How did cooking enter the picture ?  We were n't a particularly foodie family as such , but I do n't think anyone was back then , because there was n't that proliferation of restaurants or media around food or food magazines or cookbooks .  But I look back with fondness at home baking and , as a much . Mum would make a lot of chutneys and relishes , we 'd bottle beetroot and make tomato sauce at the height of summer .  As far as investment decisions go , what was your best ?  I travelled and started learning to cook , and then I was actually deported from the States for working illegally , but I realised then that I wanted to cook . I managed to get back into North America and I borrowed quite a bit of money off my mother to go to the New England Culinary Institute , to do a culinary arts degree . And that was the best money I spent .  Logan Brown was what you became known for . You spent an awful lot of money on restoration .  The building was a bank and the walls were about a foot and a half thick but Logan Brown was my first restaurant with Steve and I think we opened in 1996 . It was a pretty big deal but our attitude was we wanted to draw a line in the sand and have a I think we did pretty well .  It seemed like an absolutely huge amount of money at the time but these days . . . it seems like a pittance .  It seems to me a lot of creative people make their financial decisions on a creative basis .  Yeah , the rewards certainly are n't financial by any stretch , compared to so many other jobs . Being in the restaurant industry , something like 80 per cent of all restaurants and cafes and hospitality outlets close within 18 months .  There are n't many people that get wealthy in our industry , although it looks like that . You have to be pretty savvy on your costs and I 've never been a particularly good mathematician , but I 've always surrounded myself with people who are .  Have your attitudes towards spending changed as you 've gotten older ?  I guess one thing I 've learned is I certainly do n't skimp . I ca n't stand things that are half-cocked or people trying to do something on the cheap . But money either . . . If you 've spent too much setting up , it can be a long road getting into the black .  Have you made any investment mistakes ?  Steve and I created a product called the Grill Slinger years ago which was basically a barbecue tool belt and we invested quite a lot of money into that . . . We sold , I do n't know , something like 30,000 around the world and we never got paid a penny because we kept investing back into it . . . I think you 've got to have some failures to be really good , and understand why things went wrong .  You 've got to be able to pay the rent and pay your mortgage and put shoes on your kid 's feet , but you can be extremely wealthy without having a lot of money in the bank . I think that 's what New Zealand affords a lot of the time .  I think we should never forget or be apathetic about where we live and the opportunities we have can walk down to the beach and collect shellfish and eat them . There are not many places in the world you can do that .  Do you have Kiwisaver ?  My Kiwisaver 's hopefully my new book that 's coming out ! I have a wonderful accountant and we 're about to get all my family onto KiwiSaver .  Do you like a flutter ?  I 've never played a pokie machine in my life , but I love going to the races occasionally . And I love my footie , my rugby and enjoy having a $20 bet on the first try scorer or points spread . But I never buy Lotto tickets , not really a gambler .  I 'm not frugal with my money but I do n't like to overspend and I like to be able to sleep at night . The thought of being financially stretched stresses the life out of me .  But is n't starting a business a bit of a gamble ?  Risk gets me out of bed and I enjoy a certain amount of pretty seriously .
