a wanted man appears to be taunting christchurch police via their facebook page .  overnight police posted an appeal for information on the whereabouts of 23-year-old samuel evan lake who has a warrant outstanding for his arrest .  an hour after the photograph and description of lake was posted , a facebook user by the name sam lake posted the reply : " i need to get a new mugshot " .  soon after the user updated their profile picture to a modified screenshot of the facebook post , edited so the wanted man resembled us actor ben stiller pulling his zoolander character 's trademark pose .  not to be outdone by the cheeky response , the christchurch police wrote back : " come and see us and will arrange at no cost " .  the user shot back : " if only they were as good at finding me as they were with comebacks . "  the exchange has garnered hundreds of comments and likes in support of both parties and has gone viral on internet sites such as twitter confirm the authenticity of the posts , but had been notified and were monitoring the posts .
