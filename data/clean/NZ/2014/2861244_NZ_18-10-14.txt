A wanted man appears to be taunting Christchurch police via their Facebook page .  Overnight police posted an appeal for information on the whereabouts of 23-year-old Samuel Evan Lake who has a warrant outstanding for his arrest .  An hour after the photograph and description of Lake was posted , a Facebook user by the name Sam Lake posted the reply : " I need to get a new mugshot " .  Soon after the user updated their profile picture to a modified screenshot of the Facebook post , edited so the wanted man resembled US actor Ben Stiller pulling his Zoolander character 's trademark pose .  Not to be outdone by the cheeky response , the Christchurch police wrote back : " Come and see us and will arrange at no cost " .  The user shot back : " If only they were as good at finding me as they were with comebacks . "  The exchange has garnered hundreds of comments and Likes in support of both parties and has gone viral on internet sites such as Twitter confirm the authenticity of the posts , but had been notified and were monitoring the posts .
