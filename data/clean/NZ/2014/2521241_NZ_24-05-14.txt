<p> What exactly does a $5995 foreign exchange trading course buy you ? In the second of a three-part series , Richard Meadows receives a rude reality check on his journey to becoming a currency trader extraordinaire . <p> The crammed confines of an economy-class flight , with no drinks trolley for comfort , make a perfect breeding ground for fantasies of fame and fortune . <p> Greg Secker certainly does n't fly economy . For those who missed the first instalment , he 's the multimillionaire founder of Knowledge to Action , a controversial UK-based company drumming up business for its forex training courses Down Under . <p> When I challenged his eyebrow-raising sales pitch earlier this year ( Sample quote : " If I want you to become a millionaire , it 's very easy " ) , Secker personally offered me a place on his course . <p> While the venue has changed from Auckland to Australia - hence the flight - my mission remains the same . <p> I 'm headed to Knowledge to Action 's headquarters , in the commercial district of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath all the sizzle . <p> My eight fellow " delegates " have each shelled out the better part of $6000 on the premise that they , too , can bring their financial fantasies to life . <p> Statistically speaking , four of us will have our dreams snuffed out . <p> When I spoke with Secker in February , he said roughly half of Knowledge to Action 's course graduates will never become part or fulltime traders . Why not ? <p> " They do n't even start . It 's daunting . It 's not about whether the systems work , or whether they do n't , " he says . <p> " They do n't believe they can do it , so they do n't do it . Their brain focuses on the fear of loss . " <p> That 's one explanation . Or it could be that half the attendees decide to cut their losses and chalk it up to experience . <p> This particular group is a pleasant and intelligent bunch , but most have no experience with financial markets . <p> It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions will transform them from laypeople into hotshot traders . <p> Secker agrees two days is nowhere near long enough to get one 's head around the drivers of the currency market . <p> " That 's a five-year London School of Economics degree programme , is n't it ? " he says . <p> " This is , literally : how do you place trading strategies in the live market ; how do you identify it 's a false signal . "
