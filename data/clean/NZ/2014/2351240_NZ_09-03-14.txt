<p> Thousands of Christchurch residents have signed a petition to save their popular suburban dairy from being forced out by a supermarket giant . <p> About 2650 people signed the " We want Willy Dairy in new Halswell Shopping Centre " petition , after Foodstuffs confirmed it would not offer the dairy a space in its rebuilt shopping complex . <p> Owner Keun Mook Yook , also known as William , has run the dairy from the centre for 13 years . <p> " Lots of people want me to stay and lots of people are angry about the whole thing , " Yook said . <p> Foodstuffs said the New World supermarket next door would " fill the void " . <p> The shopping complex was damaged in Canterbury 's earthquakes and it was deemed uneconomical to repair by owners Foodstuffs and its insurers . Foodstuffs offered leaseholders space in its rebuilt centre , but told Yook there would be no room for his shop . <p> A letter from Foodstuffs property manager Clayton Young , dated May 13 , 2013 , stated the company did " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbouring New World supermarket would " fill this void " . <p> " Foodstuffs ' other shopping malls and many similar malls do not have dairies as they are more regularly seen . . . where there is no supermarket presence , " Young wrote . <p> Another letter , dated January , said the company 's demolition plans would be under way soon and Yook 's shop would have to be vacant by the end of this month . <p> Work to rebuild the complex is due to start in two to three weeks and will take 15 to 18 months to complete . <p> " It is unfair with other tenants that they have all been offered space in the redeveloped shopping centre without any issues at all . My dairy appears to have been singled out for exclusion . " <p> Halswell resident Lyn McGill said Willy Dairy was a " pivotal " part of the community and could not be replaced by a supermarket . <p> " It 's totally unfair , not just to William , but to the community . It 's a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've got out at Eastgate . We do n't need all that , we want the dairy . " <p> Local MPs Amy Adams and Megan Woods and city councillor Jimmy Chen wrote to Foodstuffs urging it to reconsider its decision , but had no success . <p> Woods said the many residents found it hard to understand Foodstuffs ' decision when the dairy and the supermarket had co-existed for more than 12 years . <p> " Mr Yook is well respected and supported within the local Halswell community and would be a sad loss .
