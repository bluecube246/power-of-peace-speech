" i have decided to contest the labour party leadership , " little said today .  " there are three immediate issues to deal with -- creating greater cohesion across the caucus , rebuilding the relationship between caucus and the party and , most importantly , getting the process under way to listen to the voters who have abandoned us .  " i have demonstrated skills from my time as a union secretary and former party president in challenging the status quo and lifting organisational performance . "  former leader david cunliffe and grant robertson are also in the leadership race .  little signalled a major shift in direction if he won the leadership , including the likely ditching of unpopular policies such as raising the pension age .  at a press conference today , the former union boss also signalled a rethink of a capital gains tax , power reforms and free doctor visits for over-65s .  little said the policies were raised constantly on the campaign trail as either scary or unaffordable .  most kiwis were pragmatic enough be true " , he said .  his approach could pitch him against finance spokesman and acting leader david parker , who advocated strongly for labour 's policy mix .  little said the caucus needed a more " cohesive style " and it had operated too much as 34 individuals .  " we do n't want to operate as 32 individuals this term , " he said .  the big task was reaching out to those voters who had left labour and " just could n't " vote for the party this year .  " the feedback i had during the campaign was a lot of big policies that i think people were a bit scared by , a bit of confusion about coalitions and what coalitions might look like , and in the end the total proposition was just a bit too scary for people and they went elsewhere , " he said .  as far as coalitions were concerned , he thought labour should " reach out " , as it did in 1999 to the alliance , to give voters a better  " we have to be clear where we would go with coalition partners , " he said .  " i think the electorate wants that , and that 's a discussion and a debate we need to have ... to get ourselves ready for 2017 . "  on policy , he said he had supported the manifesto , but the feedback from voters was that some policies were not popular .  " we all have to be honest and bold enough to say there are some things we have been doing that clearly have n't been the right thing to do , " he said .  among those were policies like increasing the pension age and a capital gains tax that parker had advocated .  " i think david parker is big enough and bold enough to be part of that process that asks questions about it and challenges it , " little said .  he would not commit to any portfolios for individuals , but he would look for a mix of experience , ability and up-and-coming talent .  he would not had not asked for votes , but had gauged support .  as a list mp who lost twice to national backbencher jonathan young in new plymouth , he had given his leadership bid some thought .  " i 've beaten myself up for a period about it , " he said .  " i 've got past that and i 've had to make a choice . do i define myself by that or do i look to the skills and experience i came into parliament with ?  " i 've decided to back myself and the skills and experience i know i have and that are crucial for labour at this time . "  he would not rule out another tilt at the new plymouth seat , " mad as that might seem to some " .  on a head-to-head clash with prime minister john key , he said key was popular but was a " transactional politician " dealing with the best political solution to day-to-day problems .  there was doubt over whether he was a leader .  " he can think more and more new zealanders are looking for where is our long-term future security , and that 's the space that labour needs to be in , " little said .  key had not set out where new zealand should be in 20 or 30 years and the society it should be .  little said rivals robertson and cunliffe were good people , but he represented a clean break and came with fresher ideas , and experience the others did not have .  he questioned why labour had 120 policies in 2014 , indicating a smaller set of policies would be easier for voters to digest and understand , with a greater emphasis on labour 's values .  " we want to chunk it down to things that we know people can understand and get hold of quicker . "  he characterised himself as " a stable , steady head on a stable , steady set of shoulders " , but he was also a good listener .
