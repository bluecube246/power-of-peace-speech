You are here  Heartland Bank becomes one of the first banks globally to buy into a peer-to-peer lender with a 10% stake in Harmoney  Heartland Bank CEO Jeff Greenslade says the bank will lend a " meaningful " amount of money through Harmoney 's internet platform having taken a 10% shareholding for an undisclosed sum in New Zealand 's first licenced peer-to-peer lender .  Peer-to-peer ( P2P ) lending is where an online service provider acts as an intermediary matching borrowers and lenders , receiving fees for doing so .  Greenslade told interest.co.nz the Harmoney deal , announced via a brief statement light on detail on Monday , is a combination of a strategic move into P2P and a way for Heartland to facilitate lending growth . Both Harmoney 's technology and the potential to reach customers that might not otherwise be available to Heartland are attractions , Greenslade said .  " The technology is something we 're quite keen to get closer to in terms of what it is in the market , but also in terms of where else it , " Greenslade said .  " It obviously gets a reach into customers that may not otherwise be available to us . Particularly I guess younger people who are more internet focused , and that 's increasingly their most comfortable way of communicating with their service providers , " added Greenslade .  The sum Heartland would lend via Harmoney is a " meaningful " one , Greenslade said .  " It 's a meaningful amount of money to get them going . That money 's lending through the platform , it 's not to Harmoney , ( but rather ) into the various risk buckets as borrowers come in . "  ' A world first '  The deal sees Heartland become Harmoney 's second biggest shareholder after founder and CEO Neil Roberts , who is Harmoney 's majority owner . Although Harmoney , which received its licence from the Financial Markets Authority in Julyis already live , it does n't officially launch until Wednesday .  Roberts therefore claims the Heartland deal as a world first .  " It 's a world first , in line up funding before launch , " Roberts said .  He said Heartland had conducted due diligence ahead of the deal , and there was nothing preventing Harmoney from doing a similar deal with another bank or financial services provider .  " I 'm very comfortable with where we 're at . We 've seen very strong demand on both sides ( borrowing and lending ) , " said Roberts .  " We 've got money to lend and we 're going to have a vibrant marketplace . "  Heartland joins a select group of banks globally that has bought into a P2P lender that includes Westpac in Australia and Barclays in South Africa . Although P2P lending is new to New Zealand , it has been around for several years , notably in the likes of Britain and the United States , overseas . See more on this here .  Formed through the merger of Marac Finance , CBS Canterbury and the Southern Cross Building Society in 2010-11 , Heartland targets niche markets incorporating small and medium sized businesses , the rural sector and the of rural lender PGG Wrightson Finance in August 2011 , and obtained bank registration from the Reserve Bank in December 2012 .  Heartland New Zealand Limited ( Heartland ) ( NZX : HNZ ) advises that it has taken an approximately 10% shareholding in HarMoney Corp Limited ( HarMoney ) , New Zealand 's only licensed peer-to-peer lending platform .  In conjunction with this , Heartland Bank Limited is providing a funding line to enable lending to a range of individual borrowers using the platform .  Heartland 's strategy is to occupy leading positions in niche markets through specialist offerings which are different to traditional banks . Likewise , HarMoney operates a lending model that challenges those being offered by mainstream banks - a model that can change the way people borrow and invest .  The shareholding in HarMoney complements Heartland 's strategy and provides a potentially valuable channel to attract customers in the Household sector that current distribution networks may not reach .  The funding line will help provide initial momentum , complementing the investments made by Retail investors . HarMoney and Heartland also intend exists to create high value products for New Zealand consumer and business customers in New Zealand .  We welcome your help to improve our coverage of this issue .

I also wonder if Heartland wo n't take a larger shareholding down the track . Maybe Harmoney will take the place of MTF .
