abyc memorial day regatta - day 1  some said that alamitos bay yacht club 's annual memorial day regatta this weekend looked like a preview of the laser class north american championships coming up june 12-15 .  pray that did n't mean the weather conditions .  there were more lasers ( 26 ) and laser radials ( 29 ) entered than all of the other classes combined , all struggling around the outside and inside race courses in uncustomary gasps of air from 1.5 to 4.5 knots from the south and southwest . it did n't stop the racing , but it made for a long afternoon .  erik bowers , a laser sailor from minnetonka , minn. , who leads his fleet with a first , fourth and third after three of seven scheduled races , said that after he won the first race ' i looked at my watch . i finished in 68 minutes ... the longest race i 've done in awhile . '  but he was n't complaining that the race---twice around a windward-leeward course for a after only one of two laps .  ' it was perfect for me , ' bowers said . ' chris barnard was leading and i passed him on the second downwind leg . '  that led to first place , followed by a fourth and a third for eight points---two ahead of abyc 's versatile veteran , chris raab ( six - three - one , ten ) , and a three-way tie at 12 among barnard , richard didham of san diego yc and andrew lewis of the trinidad and tabago sailing association .  bowers , 24 , is the third-ranking laser sailor with the us sailing team sperry top-sider olympic program , behind charlie buckingham , who is n't competing , and barnard---all training to represent the u.s. at rio de janeiro , brazil in 2016 .  at six - three and 180 pounds , he is taller than most rivals but notes , ' i get a lot of leverage . '  he also has heard the reports about rio 's unsavory sailing conditions , which would make even long beach 's atypical ' i was there in january , ' he said . ' some of the ranting on it is hyperbole . the water is dirty , but if you do n't get soaked and you do n't have any sore spots that might get infected you 'd probably be ok . it does n't smell good , but when it 's time to race no one is going to boycott it . '  kiteboards were scheduled to race only on saturday but never got airborne .  the event is the first of abyc 's traditional holiday regattas for small boats from san diego to san francisco and beyond , to be followed by the fourth of july regatta in early summer , preceding the labor day regatta in september and turkey day for thanksgiving in november .  racing is scheduled to start at noon sunday , conditions permitting . the larger classes are racing outside in long beach harbor ; the dinghies are racing inside on alamitos bay .  jonathan cressy of balboa yc goes for pin end of the start line - abyc memorial day regatta @
