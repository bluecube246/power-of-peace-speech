empty pond a fishy business  craig ashcroft 's face is reflected in his now empty pond , once home to 30 gold fish he believes were stolen two weeks ago .  a new plymouth man who had almost $1000 worth of goldfish stolen from his pond is furious police have done next to nothing to solve the mystery .  craig ashcroft reported the theft to police on sunday november 23 after noticing his 30 gold fish had been taken from his tukapa st home overnight .  " we 're talking $900 worth of fish . i 've looked at replacing them and they are $30 each . "  ashcroft said it was highly unlikely the fish had been taken by birds or a cat given the pond had grating over it and every single fish was missing .  " i do n't know how they 've done it but my initial thought was they were stolen to order . "  ashcroft said he reported the burglary but heard nothing back until last sunday when he made a complaint via the burgled a week ago and was yet to have anyone look at the scene , " he said .  then on monday , ashcroft received a letter from the central districts police , dated november 23 , that said : " after looking at all the available evidence we have not been able to find out who is responsible . unless more information or evidence is found , we ca n't proceed any further . "  but ashcroft said besides him speaking with someone at the call centre on november 23 , there had been no police action .  " i do n't know how they investigated the evidence in the time between when i reported the burglary and they wrote the letter , " ashcroft said .
