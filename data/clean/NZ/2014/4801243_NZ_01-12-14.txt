Empty pond a fishy business  Craig Ashcroft 's face is reflected in his now empty pond , once home to 30 gold fish he believes were stolen two weeks ago .  A New Plymouth man who had almost $1000 worth of goldfish stolen from his pond is furious police have done next to nothing to solve the mystery .  Craig Ashcroft reported the theft to police on Sunday November 23 after noticing his 30 gold fish had been taken from his Tukapa St home overnight .  " We 're talking $900 worth of fish . I 've looked at replacing them and they are $30 each . "  Ashcroft said it was highly unlikely the fish had been taken by birds or a cat given the pond had grating over it and every single fish was missing .  " I do n't know how they 've done it but my initial thought was they were stolen to order . "  Ashcroft said he reported the burglary but heard nothing back until last Sunday when he made a complaint via the burgled a week ago and was yet to have anyone look at the scene , " he said .  Then on Monday , Ashcroft received a letter from the central districts police , dated November 23 , that said : " after looking at all the available evidence we have not been able to find out who is responsible . Unless more information or evidence is found , we ca n't proceed any further . "  But Ashcroft said besides him speaking with someone at the call centre on November 23 , there had been no police action .  " I do n't know how they investigated the evidence in the time between when I reported the burglary and they wrote the letter , " Ashcroft said .
