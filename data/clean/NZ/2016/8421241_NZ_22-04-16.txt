<h> Mysterious appearances and disappearances <p> OPINION : I 've finally mastered it . Vanishing , that is . Those ' Invisibility Glasses ' I ordered from the back of a comic in 1965 were certainly a dead-loss . They had blacked-out lenses ! The only thing that vanished was my hard-earned 2/6d over the horizon . <p> No , my lifelong quest for invisibility is realised at last thanks to the flag referendum . Yes , I was as disgusted as you were with the whole shambolic process , but being a staunch believer in democracy , I could n't not vote , so I scrawled ' Neither , try again ' across the bottom of the ballot paper . <p> We knew the incumbent would prevail , given its weak opponent , but I was hanging out for the result to see the extent of the protest vote . Added to the silver fern muster , this would give us an indication of how many people actually want a new flag -- plus a margin for voters who gave the old ensign a grudging tick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest votes -- at least in the media , and yet those same news reports backgrounded the first flag plebiscite , when nearly 10 percent of voters ( 149,747 ) gave a two-finger salute to the entire shortlist . <p> In electoral terms all this righteous anger disappears into the euphemistic ' Informal ' file . We ca n't have rowdy plebs disturbing our political masters , so they are swept from sight under the Informal rug . <p> The final result of that second poll now lists about 5000 Informals and a similar muster of Invalids , or ballot papers where the voters ' preference was unclear . You have to go to the Electoral Commission website to find this out . The media just lumped the two figures together -- sweeping the rug under another rug . <p> Can you disappear votes that have already disappeared ? It appears so , and this became the final humiliation in a process I dearly wanted to deliver a flag the rest of the world -- and half the locals -- could recognise . <p> My head hurt . I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's an oldie now , so short strolls are all she can manage ( though she probably says the same of me ) . <p> The redevelopment plans for the huge Ocean Lodge site in Tahunanui have been posted on a billboard . This scheme could rescue the suburb from laceration by state highway . Tahuna has a lot going for it , and not a lot happening for it . All that is about to change . <p> Or not . This ca n't be right . The much-needed ' supermarket ' is a superette , and half the size of the ' bar/restaurant ' -- which bears an uncomfortable resemblance to the 1970s booze barn it will replace . <p> If the planners ' priorities seem upside down , so is the plan itself from the Beach Rd vantage-point . I ca n't get my bearings . Where are the kauri trees ? They must be preserved . I tilt my upper body sideways 90 degrees . Still ca n't quite ... <p> We walk on up to the lights and the start of the new Rocks Rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedestrians stroll back towards town on dappled paving . Cyclists rediscover their smiles now that the killer juggernauts have been banished . What little vehicular traffic there is sticks to the 20km speed limit -- as you do with road humps below and police surveillance drones above . <p> More food carts are appearing every week . We sit on the boardwalk while I munch a delicious empanada . A classical-guitar busker is on song tonight . I 've never heard Hotel California sound so evocative . <p> The setting sun casts fairydust on Tasman Bay . It 's a view you want to fall to your knees and worship . A brace of devotees walk on water towards Fifeshire Rock , completing the biblical ambience . <p> Little electric shuttle-carts carry more serious diners along to the restaurant belt , where laughter and music spill into the street . A few of the boutique stores around the old Anchor building stay open late into the evening , but our browsing is halted by a ribbon across the road . <p> It 's the official opening of the last section to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- and the new Performing Arts Centre ( delivered at a bargain $5m cost to ratepayers , as Blenheim has done ) . <p> A spokeswoman for the Victory community takes the microphone to thank all for the excellent engineering work on the Southern Link . Part-undergrounding , soundproof canopies , sight-screening and exhaust-fume scrubbers mean residents hardly know the road is there , she says . And the trust fund set up to compensate residents for their sacrifice on our behalf -- with a top-up levied from Rocks Rd/Tahunanui Drive property-owners -- is pumping more life into the neighbourhood . <p> The Mayor of the new Nelson/Tasman Council and the assembled councillors hug one another with pride . Oddly , I do n't recognise any of their faces . <p> As the ribbon is cut , a shaft of sunlight glints off the Mayor 's chains , like divine benediction . My eyes smart ... <p> " Can you hear me ? " <p> Darkness lifts as a torch-beam stabs my pupils . This divine presence is an angel in white coat . <p> " Do n't try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrain me on the bed . <p> " Where am I ? " <p> " A&amp;E . You passed out . The man who called the ambulance said you were doing headstands in front of a billboard ? " <p> " Oh yes . But I saw the most beautiful things ... " <p> " Hallucinations . Not uncommon . " <p> " People walking on water ... " <p> " Board-paddlers , I should think . " <p> " Councillors hugging ... " <p> " Hmmm . I 'll book an MRI . " <p> " You mean , none of it was real ? " <p> She shrugs . My eyes focus on the chart beside her , headed ' Invalid ' . <p> " Oh no , I 've disappeared again . " <p> She follows my gaze . " Relax . It says In-valid . Patient . " <p> " Thank god . " My relief is brief . " Shivers , the dog ... " <p> " Sorted . She 's had a dip in the rehab pool and is lounging on a deckchair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way home . " <p> " Home ? Yeah , about that . Can you do me a favour , Doc ? Put me into a coma again until the local body elections in October ? " <p> " I ca n't swing that one , sorry . " <p> " Ethically ? " <p> " No , there was a council meeting last night and all our A&amp;E beds are full , plus the mental health unit . " <p> Footnote : I ca n't really dedicate this column to Victoria Wood because every bloody one of them is dedicated to Victoria Wood . She was my hero .
