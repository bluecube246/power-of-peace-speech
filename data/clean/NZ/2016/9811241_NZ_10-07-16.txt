<h> Housing Approach Still Piecemeal <p> UnitedFuture leader , Peter Dunne , is renewing his call for a national housing summit to develop real solutions to the country 's housing problems . <p> " Over the past week we have seen an abundance of essentially scattergun policies proposed indeed , the game of political football has been quite active , " said Mr Dunne . <p> " National says Labour is just copying its policies and then , curiously , that it will not work -- and Labour announces a so-called affordable housing package , without any indication of how young families will be financed into these homes . <p> " It all sounds like the Mad Hatters Tea Party , if it were not so serious . <p> " We still have the fundamental problem that is politicians trying to outspend each other , what we need is real solutions from the sectors that need to implement them . <p> " We can only get that through having all the stakeholders come together and develop a thorough workplan , involving central and local government , the Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social housing agencies " Mr Dunne said . <p> UnitedFuture is calling on all political parties to come to the table and work on convening the summit , a model of policy making that has a proven track record . <p> " We can see the success of summits like these , look at National 's Jobs Summit back in 2009 , that conference led to a meaningful workplan that developed solutions in the long and short terms . " <p> UnitedFuture believes the fundamental goal of any housing summit must be more comprehensive than asking political parties who can promise more billions to solve a problem . <p> " We need to be looking at a wide range of solutions that will ensure that a family that earns a steady income can be able to save for a reasonable period of time and be in a position to put a deposit on a house . " Mr Dunne says . <p> " We will not get to that goal by turning this debate into a political quagmire . " <p> Labour Party leader Andrew Little has unveiled a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would use non-government organisations to cover a shortfall in emergency housing that would almost treble the number of beds available . More&gt;&gt; <h> ALSO : <p> Green Party MP Kevin Hague will today table a petition in Parliament calling for an official apology to , and pardon of , people convicted of consensual acts under anti-homosexuality laws that were overturned 30 years ago . More&gt;&gt; <p> Associate Local Government Minister Hon Louise Upston has announced the appointment of Peter Winder as a Crown Manager . Mr Winder 's role will be to support the Kaipara District Council when it returns to a fully-elected Council following the 8 October local elections . More&gt;&gt; <p> The Ministry of Health is still pursuing the government 's social bonds pilots , claiming to have learnt a number lessons after the Wise Group withdrew from what would have been the first programme funded with such an instrument . More&gt;&gt; <p> " We are disappointed , but not surprised , that the Minister has elected to take her advice on the issue of iwi representation from a political advocacy group , rather than iwi leadership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whanganui , Tuwharetoa , Nga Rauru .
