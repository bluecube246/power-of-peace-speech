<p> Probed about the approach from the Highlanders at the Irish team announcement ahead of the second test against the Springboks in Johannesburg , Schmidt did nothing to quell speculation he may soon return home . <p> " Whatever happens , this is the full focus of my attention and the one thing I want to do no matter what happens in the future is I want to leave Irish rugby in as good a shape as possible . If that 's this time next year or if it 's in three years time , I 'm not sure , " Schmidt said . <p> " All I know is that this is something we 've got to try to do and we 're investing a lot of time and effort into the players , into trying to be as good with a broader group as we possibly can be . <p> " Hopefully , there 'll be some evidence of that this weekend . <p> " This was always a chance for us to broaden that and no matter what happens , the coaching group as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less to do with it . " <p> Asked if his move to the Highlanders was a done deal , Schmidt said : " No , that was on the back of one conversation that Roger Clark had with me and I have made absolutely no commitment to the Highlanders . I 've made no commitment to anyone other than my current employers . <p> " I think it happens to a lot of coaches every so often , because I think that the clubs are always forward planning . Provinces , clubs , franchises know when their staff are coming off contract and therefore they often become aware of when other coaches are coming off contract . <p> " They find out whether there 's any interest or not . I have n't had any more than a very light conversation with Rog and I think they 've done a super job down there at the Highlanders . <p> " I watched their semifinal and final last year . I do n't want to go in and muck them up anyway , they look like they 're doing just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy I know a bit and Scott McLeod and those guys are still going to be around there next year and I do n't think , for me , that it 's a distraction . <p> " I have n't even given it any thought to be honest , because the conversation was just before the tour and I 've very much got my hands full right now . " <p> Schmidt has forged a successful coaching career since leaving New Zealand in 2007 . The former Bay of Plenty and Blues assistant secured successive European titles with Leinster , before taking Ireland to back-to-back Six Nations championships in 2014/15 , and last week guided them to their first success on South African soil despite his team playing with 14 men for 60 minutes . <p> Overall , Schmidt has a 71 per cent win ratio with Ireland . He is also close with fellow Kiwi coach Vern Cotter and , should he pursue the Highlanders job , may look to coax him home from the national job with Scotland . <p> Former Hurricanes coach Mark Hammett , who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also likely to throw his hat in the ring for the Highlanders head coach role in 2018.
