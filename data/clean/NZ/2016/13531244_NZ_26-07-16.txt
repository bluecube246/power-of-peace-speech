anz bank wins in australian high court bank fee case  australia 's highest court upholds a decision that anz bank was entitled to charge credit card late payment fees of up to a$35 .  a new zealand group planning a class action against banks over fees is studying a judgement handed down in australia , which went in anz 's favour .  australia 's highest court has delivered the final blow to a long-running legal battle over bank fees , upholding a decision that anz bank was entitled to charge late payment fees of up to a$35 ( nz$37.41 ) .  on wednesday morning the high court dismissed with costs an appeal from anz bank customers , who since 2010 have been running a class action against the bank , claiming it unfairly overcharged tens of thousands of people for paying their credit card bills late .  tim wimborne/reuters  the customers claimed anz unfairly overcharged tens of thousands of people for paying their credit card bills late .  however , this was overturned last year when the full bench of of potential costs to the bank , including the impact on provisioning for bad debts and regulatory capital .  the customers , represented by maurice blackburn , had appealed this ruling , but their appeal was dismissed with costs .  a key deciding factor in the case was whether the bank 's late payment fee of a$35 , later dropped to a$20 , was an " unfair penalty . "  the majority of the australian high court agreed with anz 's claim that the maximum costs to banks of late payments should consider making provisions for soured loans , for holding regulatory capital , debt collection costs . the interests of the bank were affected by each of these costs , it said .  it also rejected a second appeal that alleged late payment fees amounted to unconscionable conduct , unjust transactions , and unfair contract terms .  the action against anz was funded by litigation funder imf bentham and had attracted about 43,500 customers . aside from the impact on banks , the legal principles being debated in the case may have implications for other telecommunications companies .  in new zealand , lawyer andrew hooker has been the driving force behind fair play on fees , a campaign to take a class action against the big four banks over fees it considered unfairly high .  it cited examples including dishonour fees , credit card over-limit fees and credit card late payment fees . the new zealand proceedings were on hold pending the outcome of the australian case .  hooker said he had not yet had time to digest the implications of the australian decision . the new zealand campaign would need to get advice on what it meant for its own case , he said .
