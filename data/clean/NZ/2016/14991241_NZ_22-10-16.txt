Canterbury pile on 417 runs on first day as Plunket Shield season gets under way  ANDREW VOERMAN AND WAYNE MARTIN  Last updated 18:54 , October 22 2016  PHOTOSPORT  Todd Astle was not out on 167 at the end of the first day of the match between Canterbury and Northern Districts .  It was bats that did most of the talking on the opening day of the domestic cricket season , as Canterbury and Otago blazed their way to dominant positions in the first round of the Plunket Shield .  Having been 60 for four shortly before lunch , and 150 for five midway through the second session , Canterbury would have been over the moon to finish the day on 417 for eight , especially seeing as they had been sent in by Northern Districts at Hagley Oval in Christchurch .  They mostly have Todd Astle to thank for that remarkable turnaround , with the all-rounder not out on 167 off just 161 balls , an innings that remarkably has contained 22 fours so far , but no sixes , 100th first-class game .  He found valuable lower order support from spinner Tim Johnston , who hit 66 off 62 balls , Kyle Jamieson , who made 40 , and debutant Henry Shipley , who is also not out on 24 .  Northern 's frontline seamers , Scott Kuggeleijn , Jimmy Baker and Zak Gibson had all been impressive in the morning session , as they appeared to have got their side off to a perfect start , but came in for some stick as the day progressed . Kuggeleijn finished the day with the best figures , taking three for 109 off 25 overs .  PHOTOSPORT  Hamish Rutherford made 143 as Otago compiled 302 on the opening day of their match against Central Districts .  Meanwhile , centuries by Hamish Rutherford and Brad Wilson have left Otago in complete control after day one of their match against Central Districts in Nelson .  The two openers had the Central bowling attack at their mercy for most of day at Saxton Oval after Otago had elected to bat in fine , sunny conditions . And they three .  Former Black Caps batsman Rutherford took the opportunity to score his ninth first-class century , hitting 143 runs off just 176 balls , the left-hander peppering the boundary with 21 fours and four sixes .  Wilson was in less of a hurry , taking 254 balls to contribute 111 runs for his 12th first-class century , hitting 12 fours and two sixes .  The pair added a staggering 227 runs together in their opening stand and were n't separated until the third over after the tea break when left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel finally made the breakthrough .  Ryan Duffy added 31 runs , leaving Neil Broom ( 4 not out ) and Josh Finnie ( 6 not out ) to see Otago through to stumps .  The only game where bowlers had the upper hand was at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui , where Wellington won the toss and sent Auckland in to bat .  The defending champions put on 99 for their first wicket - Michael Guptill-Bunce making 50 , and test opening prospect Jeet Raval 47 - and 70 for their just 100 runs . Veteran seamer Brent Arnel was the pick of the bowlers , taking four for 57 , while Hamish Bennett chipped in with three for 64 and Jeetan Patel claimed three for 79 during an innings that included a break for rain .  By stumps , Wellington had lost the wickets of openers Michael Papps and Luke Woodcock , and were 43 for two , with Stephen Murdoch and Hamish Marshall at the crease.
