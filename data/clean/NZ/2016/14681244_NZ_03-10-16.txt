<p> The department said it complained to police after staff were threatened and abused by anti-1080 campaigners on more than one occasion . <p> A 1080 pesticide drop was recently completed on the northern West Coast . <p> Westport-based conservationist Pete Lusk said he believed a complaint was laid about him after he posted a photo of a ranger on Facebook that received hateful comments from locals against 1080 . <p> Mr Lusk said he was visited by a police officer , but was confident he had n't done anything wrong by posting the photo . <p> " I 've never made verbal threats , " he said . <p> " I 'm really , really careful , even on Facebook , you know , someone says ' this guy should be done in ' or something like that , I 'll make a point of not liking those comments , because I do n't like those comments .
