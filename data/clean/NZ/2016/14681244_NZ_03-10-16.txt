the department said it complained to police after staff were threatened and abused by anti-1080 campaigners on more than one occasion .  a 1080 pesticide drop was recently completed on the northern west coast .  westport-based conservationist pete lusk said he believed a complaint was laid about him after he posted a photo of a ranger on facebook that received hateful comments from locals against 1080 .  mr lusk said he was visited by a police officer , but was confident he had n't done anything wrong by posting the photo .  " i 've never made verbal threats , " he said .  " i 'm really , really careful , even on facebook , you know , someone says ' this guy should be done in ' or something like that , i 'll make a point of not liking those comments , because i do n't like those comments .
