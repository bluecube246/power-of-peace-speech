<h> 12 questions to ask yourself before making a big decision <p> Often , our hesitance to make up our minds when confronted with a big choice results in not taking any action whatsoever . <p> Moving to a new city . Asking for a promotion . Hunting for a different job . Trying online dating . Breaking up with your S.O . <p> Life is packed with decisions , big and small . But some require deeper contemplation . Often , our hesitance to make up our minds when confronted with a big choice results in not taking any action whatsoever . <p> We avoid it . We want to hide under the covers and hope our need to do something will pass . <p> But the harsh truth is that inaction is a decision too . If we do n't move , forge ahead for that VP title , start a side project this summer or call off our less-than-satisfactory relationship , we are deciding to stay where we are . <p> 123RF <p> Ask yourself : What do I want five , even 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looming in your life , do n't hide . Ask yourself these 12 questions -- and write down your answers -- to get clear on what 's the right choice for you . <p> 1 . How long have I been thinking about this ? This is a brilliant question that a good life coach would ask you . If someone comes to me wanting to start a party-planning business , it 's very different if their answer is " Since I saw a movie about it two days ago ! " versus " Two or three years -- it 's always been in the back of my mind . " <p> The length of time is a good indicator of how important something is to you . The longer you 've been thinking about it , the more important it tends to be . <p> 123RF <p> Picture yourself and your life a few months down the road . <p> 2 . How committed am I to this change ? Rate your level of commitment on a scale out of 10 . Think about the amount of work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is your level of commitment higher than a 7 ? That 's great data for your decision ! <p> 3 . When I think about it , how does my body feel ? Imagine the potential outcomes of the decision . Picture yourself and your life a few months down the road . How does it feel ? How does your body respond ? Excitement , a little nervousness and relief are very positive emotions ! Beware of feelings of dullness or indifference . <p> 4 . Am I feeling fear or intuition ? Our fear often tells us what we need to do next . That 's because when something really matters to us it scares us . Hey -- we do n't want to fail or screw up on this very important thing ! Get real about the fear you might be feeling . Think : Could my reluctance here be intuitive -- guiding me toward the right path ? <p> 5 . Is this decision in line with my long-term goals ? Ask yourself : What do I want five , even 10 years from now ? Write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays into that longer-term plan . <p> For example , if you 've been single for a while and hope to be married with kids in a few years , getting out there and creating an online dating profile is probably smart ! Do what your future self will thank you for . <p> 6 . What are my precise options ? Let 's go deeper . What specific options are there ? Are there only two ? Are there more ? Are there other options you might not have considered ? Write them down -- the possibilities might surprise you ! <p> 7 . What are the risks of my options ? When you get clear on your options and have outlined the one you most want to pursue , ask : What is the real risk of doing this ? List every single thing that is stopping you and the absolute worst outcomes of making the decision . Now be honest : How risky is it , really ? <p> 8 . What is the risk of not doing it ? This is one of my favourite questions ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a calling to move somewhere new , a desire to end a relationship -- what are you giving up when you do n't do it ? Because inaction is action , the truth here can be very sobering . What might you be missing out on in your life if you do nothing ? <p> 9 . Is now the right time ? Bear in mind : Not all decisions need to be made immediately . But there are few real reasons we ever need to delay making a big one when it presents itself . Remember , life is always uncertain and time waits for no one . <p> 10 . If not now , when ? If right this moment is n't the best time to make this decision , give yourself a deadline . But do n't wait too long -- deadlines made further than six months out rarely work because we can not " taste " them . What will you commit to -- before the holidays , this year ? <p> 11 . What does my past experience tell me about this ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When have you had to make big decisions before ? Did you survive ? Are you happy you made them ? How can past choices inform you in making this choice ? <p> 12 . Where is the fun ? Change is scary , yes . But growth never happens without change . There are no exceptions . Can you see or anticipate the fun in making this decision ? <p> A client of mine went through an emotional breakup last year but soon enough snagged herself a great studio apartment in a neighbourhood she loves and took her first solo vacation . She 's about to take her second trip alone , and it 's all she talks about . But this could only happen after her big decision to move on as a single woman . Even in tough times you can focus on the positive -- it 's always there ! <p> The takeaway ... Making a big decision does n't have to be so daunting . There are no right or wrong answers or right or wrong ways to live your life . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in the grander scheme of your life to put it in perspective . You do n't have to ask other people what they think . Your inner wisdom has the answers .
