" kaitlyn or kathryn or whatever her name is , " begins kevin kiley of the kiley &amp; carman show on 92.3 the fan , " she 's been hired as a , this is absurd by the way , she 's been hired as a quality control coach . "  just a few seconds into the program and we 're off to a terrible start . it does n't get much better , by the way . the show continues by saying she 's a woman and how that makes her incapable of understanding the game of football , or something .  " no place for a woman in professional sports , in football , coaching men . men will not take to it , " kiley says . " if you have 10 men on special teams , eight of them will be mumbling under their breath , it 's counter-productive . you 're setting her up to fail . "  for what it 's worth , if a team has 10 men on special teams then they 'd be a man players on the field . but let 's continue to talk about how smith , or anyone with a uterus , ca n't understand football .  " this is the old conversation we had about women vote for the hall of fame in football . it 's absurd , " he says . " i mean do you really want your determination , whether you make the hall of fame in football , do you want a woman to have a vote on that , who 's never played the game and does n't understand the intensity of the game ? "  the conversation continues on for several more minutes , and if you feel inclined you can listen to the whole thing below .  to be fair , the other host ken carman was n't on board with what his partner was saying . he pointed out how there are men with the same credentials as smith and how they 're just as qualified . kiley , however , stayed firm in his belief that women do n't belong in football .  kiley played linebacker at the nfl , though that apparently amounted to a preseason stint with the jets in 1974 .  earlier this season when jen welter was an intern coach for the cardinals , the players had no problems with her . in fact , they quite enjoyed her presence .  " she 's a great lady , " said linebacker kevin minter at the time . " she 's helped a lot and she 's a stickler about fundamentals and what not . she knows a lot about making you better as a person , too , with the notes she left on your locker , the words of encouragement from what she sees on film . she was like a real good person to feed off of . "  at some point , women coaching in the nfl wo n't be headline news every time it occurs , and that 's when there will be true progress . for now though , we still have to deal with guys like kiley who hold an old-fashioned mindset.
