ecan pilot project to work with farmers separate from industry bodies  the council will make their decision on the plan on august 19 after a week of public meetings .  environment canterbury is conducting a pilot project to help more independent farmers complete their environmental plans .  the programme will assess whether one-on-one meetings between farmers and ecan will work for those lacking outside support from the likes of irrigation schemes or industry bodies such as fonterra .  it is aimed at 100 farmers across waimakariri and selwyn districts , 50 in each , and has been running for about two months .  supplied  waimakariri zone manager andrew arps has been working with eyreton farmer darryl brown to put together his farm environment plan .  " that 's just an initial target . ultimately there 'll be more than that but it 's just to give us an initial target to focus on and get underway . . . we 've identified people who are going to need some help to get them on a roll , " waimakariri zone these farmers reside in , land-use consents will be needed for any farming work done on their property from 2017 .  the meetings will take farmers through their farm environment plans ( feps ) , setting out what they can do to their properties to reduce any adverse environmental effects , arps said .  supplied  waimakariri zone manager andrew arps , right , has been working with eyreton farmer darryl brown to put together his farm environment plan .  " as part of getting that consent they will need the fep so , if you like , that 's the check that 's in place to ensure the environmental work is actually done . "  plans could include anything from riparian planting to stock fencing to keep cattle from entering neighbouring waterways .  eyreton farmer darryl brown started making improvements to his 1200-acre horse and dairy farm after joining the project two months ago .  he said the cost associated with implementing farm environment plans was lessened when considering the long-term impact of the changes .  " it 's a bit scary at that you 're making decisions which benefit your farm and the environment .  " we 've already got plans to make our irrigation systems more efficient with increased monitoring . making the entire farm more efficient means using less resources and having more money in the bottom line . "  he said the process of record gathering and putting together a farm mapping system had given him a greater overview of his entire farming operation .  " since 1968 the farm has grown from 225 acres to well over 1000 acres so we 're definitely having an impact on the environment . looking at the farm as a whole and using the mapping system to identify areas where we 're under or over irrigating is really helpful . "  brown said his perception about ecan had changed since working one-on-one with the pilot programme .  " there has been a bit of a stigma about ecan but i 've seen a real change with this type of one-on-one approach and i 've found it fantastic .  " it 's just more relaxed having a chat environment plan together can benefit farm profits and the environment gives you a reason to get started . "
