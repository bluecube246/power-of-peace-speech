Sub Navigation  European human rights group warns on Azerbaijan constitution  3:40 AM Thursday Sep 22 , 2016  SHARE :  Facebook  Twitter  Google+  LinkedIn  Not saved  Email  Print  PARIS ( AP ) " A European law and human rights commission on Wednesday criticized proposed constitutional changes in Azerbaijan that would extend the president 's term , a conclusion that drew an angry response from the ex-Soviet nation .  The Venice Commission , a watchdog body of constitutional law experts based in France , released a preliminary report saying that extending the presidential mandate " can not be justified " and that other proposed legal changes would upset the balance of powers .  The commission expressed concern about a measure limiting public gatherings and said a measure giving the president power to dissolve parliament would weaken political dissent .  Azerbaijan is to hold a referendum Monday on the changes . Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the capital of Azerbaijan Saturday to protest against them .  Some critics characterize the oil-rich Caspian Sea nation as of the previous president and see the proposed measures as a mechanism for extending his rule .  The Venice Commission experts are part of the Council of Europe , a rights authority whose 47 members " including Azerbaijan " have signed the European Convention on Human Rights .  The commission also complained that Azerbaijan rushed these reforms through without enough parliamentary and public debate , and said it regrets that Azerbaijan did n't consult the commission .  Shahin Aliyev , the head of the legal department in Azerbaijan 's presidential administration , shrugged off the Venice Commission 's criticism as hasty and unfounded .  " We are seeing that hasty conclusion , which has many flaws , as politically driven , " he said at a briefing in the capital Baku . " They speak to us in a language of ultimatums . "  The presidential aide voiced surprise that the commission had n't asked Azerbaijan for any explanation or clarification before issuing its verdict . He rebuffed the criticism and argued that the proposed constitutional changes are intended to streamline the government structure in order , in office since succeeding his father in 2003 , has firmly allied the Shia Muslim nation with the West , helping secure its energy and security interests and offset Russia 's influence in the strategic Caspian region . At the same time , his government has long faced criticism in the West for showing little tolerance for dissent and holding elections that fall below democratic standards .
