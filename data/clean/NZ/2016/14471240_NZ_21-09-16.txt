Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the capital of Azerbaijan Saturday to protest against them . <p> Some critics characterize the oil-rich Caspian Sea nation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous president and see the proposed measures as a mechanism for extending his rule . <p> The Venice Commission experts are part of the Council of Europe , a rights authority whose 47 members " including Azerbaijan " have signed the European Convention on Human Rights . <p> The commission also complained that Azerbaijan rushed these reforms through without enough parliamentary and public debate , and said it regrets that Azerbaijan did n't consult the commission . <p> Shahin Aliyev , the head of the legal department in Azerbaijan 's presidential administration , shrugged off the Venice Commission 's criticism as hasty and unfounded . <p> " We are seeing that hasty conclusion , which has many flaws , as politically driven , " he said at a briefing in the capital Baku .
