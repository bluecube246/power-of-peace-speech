Wilaci argues A$33.6mn in late payment fees not a penalty  Wilaci argues A$33.6mn in late payment fees were n't a penalty in Court of Appeal  By Sophie Boot  Oct. 4 ( BusinessDesk ) - Lawyers for Australian businessman John Grill 's Wilaci investment unit have argued that A$33.6 million in late payment fees it wants from Pyne Gould Corp subsidiary Torchlight Fund No 1 LP were n't penalty fees in the Court of Appeal this morning .  Last October , Justice Matthew Muir in the High Court ruled the Torchlight unit did n't have to pay the fee on a A$37 million loan from Wilaci , which " so significantly exceeds the loss likely to be caused by the breach that it qualifies as extravagant and therefore unenforceable , " saying the A$2.17 million per month fee " was undoubtedly extravagant in relation to any such loss . "  Wilaci loaned the funds to Torchlight on Aug. 22 , 2012 , to help the Pyne Gould entity through what managing director George Kerr described as " a very tight liquidity situation " for repayment from its debtors , including Torchlight 's Australian real estate investment , RCL Group . A high-profile dispute with the Financial Markets Authority made it more difficult for Kerr to recapitalise Torchlight .  The loan was due to be repaid by Oct. 26 , a deadline Torchlight missed , although Wilaci did n't immediately call on the loan , rather it managed the repayment through seven tranches between October 2013 and May 2014 .  Justice Stephen Kos , president of the appeal court , said he had summarised Wilaci 's appeal case in five points . Wilaci has relied on the Australian Federal Court 's 2015 decision in Paciocco v ANZ Banking Group , where it was found that late fees charged by the bank on credit card payments were n't penalties and therefore were enforceable , in its arguments in the High Court and the appeal court today .  " The first is that in Paciocco , to be a penalty , the sole purpose of the provision must be functional , " Justice Kos said . " The test is not simply whether the . Third , the relevant interests of the innocent party go beyond simply breach damages otherwise payable . That may be particularly in the case where the parties are substantial , sophisticated commercial entities . The trend seems to be to constrain the doctrine rather than to expand it , and it is easier to justify the doctrine in a consumer context rather than a commercial one . "  Wilaci is also arguing that to be a penalty , the fee charged " would need to be out of all proportion to the innocent party 's legitimate commercial interests , " Justice Kos said , which the appellant 's Sydney-based lawyer , David Jackson QC , agree with .  " Now we 're talking about $37 million being at risk , and we 're gauging the reasonableness of this fee against that context . Is n't this your essential problem ? We 're not talking about damages on the assumption that $37 million has been repaid , we 're talking about $37 million being at risk , " Justice Miller said .  Stewart said that did n't affect Justice Miller said it was important to the question of whether the payment was " extravagant or unconscionable . "  Justice Kos questioned why Torchlight 's Kerr had not taken a loan elsewhere when the fund could n't pay back the money within the 60 day loan period .  " Sixty-one days into the transaction , he could have taken this to another banker and got a presumably more expensive funding option , " Kos said . " Instead he has essentially gained the prospect of being able to set aside the continued financing effect on the basis it 's a penalty . He gets the money on that basis - 1.5 percent above market - that 's a very cheap rate in the circumstances . "  Stephen Hunter , the other lawyer for the respondent , said the capital was n't necessarily at risk despite the fund not meeting the payment obligations as Torchlight had assets but not cash .  " When we 're talking about a fee for late repayment , you have the damages recoverable in law , which in this case is either costs Wilaci itself was incurring from Credit Suisse , which was $1.8 million - measure that against the penalty , which is $31 million , " Hunter said .
