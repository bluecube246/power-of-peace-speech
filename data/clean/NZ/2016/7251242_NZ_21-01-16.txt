UK levy may close door on jobs for Kiwis  Kiwis hoping to get a job in the UK could be dealt a further blow after a proposal to introduce a new ? 1000 ( $2205 ) a year immigration skills levy looks set to be implemented .  If introduced , the new law would require firms employing skilled non-European Union migrants to pay ? 1000 for each worker recruited outside of Europe per year .  The recommendation was part of a package from the UK Government 's migration advisory committee , under a new crackdown ordered by UK Home Secretary Theresa May , reported the Guardian .  It 's the latest policy squeeze on migrants to the UK that could affect New Zealanders , coming just days after the announcement of a strict new law which will see all migrants from outside the EU earning less than ? 35,000 a year prevented from staying in the UK for longer than five years .  The skilled migrant levy is estimated to cut the flow of skilled non-EU workers by 20 per cent a and could hit the recruitment of overseas nurses and teachers the hardest .  The British Government 's labour market experts claim most skilled migrants from outside Europe bring little in the way of new skills and are paid more than their British counterparts , the newspaper reported . However , those in some jobs , such as doctors , nurses and teachers , typically earn less than their UK peers , by as must as ? 6000 per year .  The proposal came with a recommendation to include a rise in the minimum salary threshold for jobs filled from overseas , from ? 20,800 to ? 30,000 .  Meanwhile , the Government will continue to lobby UK ministers over the impact of the strict ? 35,000 earnings policy and the impact it will have on Kiwi workers when it comes into effect in April .  An online petition against the policy change is garnering big support among Britons with about 77,000 people signing within six days .  A number of people living in the UK have emailed the Herald , worried they may now be kicked meet the threshold . Some have been living there since the 80s .  Immigration officials were in conversation with their British counterparts on working arrangements for expat Kiwis , a spokesman for Immigration Minister Murray McCully said .  However , the spokesman said he did not think many New Zealanders would be affected as most were working in the UK on two-year Youth Mobility Scheme or on ancestry visas .  Others held skilled work permits and were likely to be earning above the income threshold .  There are about 200,000 New Zealanders living in the UK . Since 2010 Kiwis need a job and a sponsoring employer to gain a skilled migrant visa .
