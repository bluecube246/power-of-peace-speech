<h> How ' street style ' lost its meaning and its power <p> ROBIN GIVHAN <p> Last updated 16:49 , October 4 2016 <p> BENOIT TESSIER <p> Vetements has brought subversive style to the catwalk . <p> There is no such thing as street style . Not anymore . <p> Oh sure , photographers still surge around the entrances to fashion shows here in an attempt to capture style in its so-called natural habitat . The women ( it is mostly women ) traipse to and fro posing for the photo pack , sometimes feigning nonchalance . But very little of what is presented as " street style " is actually of-the-street , born and bred . <p> These looks have not been cobbled together organically . Much of what we 're seeing the fashion crowd wear on the street is simply well-placed advertising for brands - whether the clothing itself or the blogger wearing it . It is wholly domesticated . <p> Today , what we used to think of as street style - athletic , down-market , serendipitous , multicultural - is reflected in the looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maison Margiela . It is in Off-White and Koche - up-and-coming , highly praised new labels . <p> Most notably , it is in Balenciaga . Designer Demna Gvasalia has been instrumental in erasing the lines between what had always been considered street style and the rarefied point-of-view of the atelier . <p> As part of the Vetements team , he ushered in an era of ungainly , oversized silhouettes and helped to turn such mundane commodities as a logo T-shirt for express-mail giant DHL into a covetable fashion item . <p> In 2015 , Gvasalia came to Balenciaga as creative director and brought his subversive tendencies with him - as well as a deep respect for the craftsmanship of one of the most high-minded houses in fashion history . For spring , the jackets are oversized with such broad and structured shoulders that they reach beyond the realm of hyperbole and into distortion . There are vests that resemble gussied-up flotation devices . And bold floral prints exquisitely teeter on the edge of garish . <p> The elements that once defined street style are now high fashion 's greatest source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galliano 's Margiela in particular , they have been incorporated in dazzling ways . But sometimes the embrace of street chic comes across as a flourish tacked on to spice a bourgeois brand with a bit of danger , to make a woman with a coddled existence feel a bit more in touch . It is an attempt to buy cool . <p> Laudably , Junya Watanabe took the hard-edge look of punk rockers and Berlin 's street-artist scene and combined it with the dazzling geometric construction that has long been part of his repertoire . It was a bravura presentation , mixing souvenir T-shirts with sharply tailored coats , leather shorts and tops that called to mind giant sea urchins . <p> Takahashi also used music as a source of inspiration for his Undercover collection , although he chose jazz . His collection paired loose-fitting trousers , wide-leg jeans and embellished jackets in a collage of textures worn with sneakers or Birkenstock-style sandals . <p> A photo posted by UNDERCOVER ( @undercoverlab ) on Sep 30 , 2016 at 2:15pm PDT <p> Such feelings recall the conversation around the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium for their Calvins , and designers justified the prices with a vast assortment of fits and washes . <p> Street style is not just a pair of jeans . It was an entire sensibility - a rejoinder to the formalised edicts of design houses . <p> Vetements 's DHL T-shirt was read as a searing commentary on what the culture values and why . But then its droll aesthetics became coveted fashion , Gvasalia landed at Balenciaga , and Vetements showed alongside haute couture - the most highfalutin form of fashion there is . What had ostensibly been subversive was absorbed into the ivory tower . <p> A photo posted by VETEMENTS ( @vetementsofficial ) on Sep 2 , 2016 at 9:11am PDT <p> Virgil Abloh , whose Off-White label made a splash in menswear with graffiti-marked army jackets and pants , showed his womenswear line before an audience including Kanye West , Frank Ocean and various Kardashians . As one might expect , the collection included edgy sweatshirts and cool-girl trousers . <p> But Abloh also showed the sort of frilly , ruffled dresses that one might find in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do with the " street style " conversation he so ably led ? Fashion is mutating . So pair the debutante skirt with a hoodie and call yourself modern . <p> And what do you call a brand like Koche , with hoodies and T-shirts designed by Christelle Kocher , who is also the artistic director of Lemarie , Chanel 's haute couture feather house ? Kocher roots her brand in the " real " Paris , presenting an earlier collection in a grubby passageway frequented by drug addicts . This season , she chose a chaotic mall where shoppers disgorged from escalators into the middle of her show . <p> Look closely and you 'll see that her clothes are beautifully made , with fine fabrics and luxury embellishments . But from a few paces away , they look perfectly at home amid the food courts and sale bins . <p> This shift in fashion offers cause for optimism . If everyone is wearing sweatshirts , maybe the tribal walls will tumble . But in the meantime , it feels like fashion is being degraded into little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been connected to status , but it was also about the unique , wondrous nature of the clothes . It was : I can afford this really extraordinary Dior . Now , you can just show off your fancy Dior underpants . <p> Somewhere out there , far from the runways , remain some unco-opted styles . Looks that have not yet been absorbed by the mass-market garment business or the fashion elite . The looks are personal - maybe even thoughtful or provocative . Call it subversive . Call it idiosyncratic . Call it serendipitous . <p> But everything that has been on the runways for spring 2017 - and Instagrammed from the circus that accompanies it - is just plain fashion .
