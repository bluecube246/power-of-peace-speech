<h> Trout fishing rules changing <p> Trout fishing will be prohibited upstream of the Awahou Steam 's junction with Lake Rotorua under changes to fishing regulations which come into force in October . <p> Under the new regulations the Awahou Stream , a tributary of Lake Rotorua , will be designated ' closed waters ' in the Angler 's Notice , Fish &amp; Game has advised . <p> File Photo <p> The change results from a submission to the Eastern Fish and Game Council from NgatiRangiwewehi members who live alongside the stream and own the adjoining land and the private access road to the stream mouth . <p> Eastern Fish and Game Council had publicly notified the proposal and consulted with anglers prior to making the decision . <p> Eastern Fish &amp; Game Manager Andy Garrick says the closure will bring a number of benefits . <p> " Firstly , we recognise the local community 's growing concern over social issues -- including thefts , conflicts between individuals , and the presence of undesirable elements , including poachers .
