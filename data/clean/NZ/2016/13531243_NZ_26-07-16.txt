Trout fishing rules changing  Trout fishing will be prohibited upstream of the Awahou Steam 's junction with Lake Rotorua under changes to fishing regulations which come into force in October .  Under the new regulations the Awahou Stream , a tributary of Lake Rotorua , will be designated ' closed waters ' in the Angler 's Notice , Fish &amp; Game has advised .  File Photo  The change results from a submission to the Eastern Fish and Game Council from NgatiRangiwewehi members who live alongside the stream and own the adjoining land and the private access road to the stream mouth .  Eastern Fish and Game Council had publicly notified the proposal and consulted with anglers prior to making the decision .  Eastern Fish &amp; Game Manager Andy Garrick says the closure will bring a number of benefits .  " Firstly , we recognise the local community 's growing concern over social issues -- including thefts , conflicts between individuals , and the presence of undesirable elements , including poachers . "  The closure would help address what locals the stream a safer place for children and family groups .  " The stream is now targeted by poachers every summer and has become a " hot spot " for us , sparking frequent callouts for our ranging staff . The closure to angling will mean anyone seen fishing there can readily be identified as breaching the regulations . "  Andy says that naturally the trout would benefit as well . " Closing this section of the Awahou Stream will provide a cold water refuge for trout stressed by Lake Rotorua 's rising water temperatures in summer , which drive fish in search of cooler water .  " But it 's important that anglers note they will still be able to access and fish Lake Rotorua downstream of the landmark pole , where there are ample fishing opportunities through the summer months , " he adds .  The second change focuses on winter shoreline fishing on Lake Okataina . This area is to be extended by moving the western landmark pole further to the west ( away from the lodge ) .  This will provide further the lake levels are low .  The angling regulation-setting process is undertaken annually , and allows for the Eastern Fish and Game Council to hear submissions and recommend alterations to the fishing ' rules and regs ' to the Minister of Conservation who makes the final call . A full review is carried out every second year .  " We try to consult as widely as possible on these changes and always encourage anglers to have their say . "
