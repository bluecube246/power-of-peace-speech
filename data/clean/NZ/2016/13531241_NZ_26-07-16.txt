the banking sector is showing few signs of feeling any economic headwinds , with profits and growth in assets managing to maintain momentum .  photo : 123rf  a report by accounting firm kpmg shows the sector 's profit edged higher in the three months to march , even though margins were fractionally lower , bad debts were slightly higher and expenses fell .  the banks surveyed had a collective profit of nearly $1.2 billion for the march quarter , which was higher than the previous quarter , but down on the record near-$1.3 billion during the middle of 2015 .  lending was up fractionally , while assets stood at record levels .  but kpmg head of financial services john kensington said there were some potential concerns .  " domestic saving has sort of stopped a little bit ... the deposit growth has stopped or slowed ... but the lending growth has accelerated , " he said .  mr kensington said that meant a greater reliance on overseas borrowing .  " we have to go and get more funding from offshore and we give away a little bit of the control of our own destiny , because we become reliant on the rates that we are able to get from offshore , " he added .
