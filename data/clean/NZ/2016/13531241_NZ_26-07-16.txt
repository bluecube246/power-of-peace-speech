The banking sector is showing few signs of feeling any economic headwinds , with profits and growth in assets managing to maintain momentum .  Photo : 123rf  A report by accounting firm KPMG shows the sector 's profit edged higher in the three months to March , even though margins were fractionally lower , bad debts were slightly higher and expenses fell .  The banks surveyed had a collective profit of nearly $1.2 billion for the March quarter , which was higher than the previous quarter , but down on the record near-$1.3 billion during the middle of 2015 .  Lending was up fractionally , while assets stood at record levels .  But KPMG Head of Financial Services John Kensington said there were some potential concerns .  " Domestic saving has sort of stopped a little bit ... the deposit growth has stopped or slowed ... but the lending growth has accelerated , " he said .  Mr Kensington said that meant a greater reliance on overseas borrowing .  " We have to go and get more funding from offshore and we give away a little bit of the control of our own destiny , because we become reliant on the rates that we are able to get from offshore , " he added .
