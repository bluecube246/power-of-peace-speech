<p> The banking sector is showing few signs of feeling any economic headwinds , with profits and growth in assets managing to maintain momentum . <p> Photo : 123rf <p> A report by accounting firm KPMG shows the sector 's profit edged higher in the three months to March , even though margins were fractionally lower , bad debts were slightly higher and expenses fell . <p> The banks surveyed had a collective profit of nearly $1.2 billion for the March quarter , which was higher than the previous quarter , but down on the record near-$1.3 billion during the middle of 2015 . <p> Lending was up fractionally , while assets stood at record levels . <p> But KPMG Head of Financial Services John Kensington said there were some potential concerns . <p> " Domestic saving has sort of stopped a little bit ... the deposit growth has stopped or slowed ... but the lending growth has accelerated , " he said . <p> Mr Kensington said that meant a greater reliance on overseas borrowing . <p> " We have to go and get more funding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore and we give away a little bit of the control of our own destiny , because we become reliant on the rates that we are able to get from offshore , " he added .
