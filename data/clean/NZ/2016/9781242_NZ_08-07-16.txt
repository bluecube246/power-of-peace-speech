<p> Alex Noren finished with a flourish to claim the second-round lead at the Scottish Open on Friday , coming home in just 31 shots on his final nine holes . <p> Danny Lee had been the long-time clubhouse leader following his round of 66 , but Noren , starting at the 10th , produced an identical score to move onto eight under par for the tournament - one shot clear of the New Zealander and England 's Eddie Pepperell . <p> " I like this place , " Noren , who enjoyed a run of five birdies in seven holes that started at the second , said of Castle Stuart . <p> " It 's a really fun course to play . A few very tricky holes and then a few holes where you can go for the green in two on the par fives and you can reach , I think , two greens today on the par four in one , which is very fun for us . <p> " Some weeks , we play courses where it 's tough all the way around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix , so I like it . <p> " It was n't easy but I managed to hit some good shots . It got better and better -- I played steady on the front nine , and then my last nine holes , I really got it going . <p> " It 's always nice when you get it going and then another birdie maybe drops , and that 's what happened today . " <p> Lee had been due to defend the Greenbrier Classic on the PGA Tour before the event was cancelled due to devastating floods in West Virginia , and has promised to donate $500 to flood-relief efforts for every birdie he makes in Aberdeen . <p> " I made a lot of birdies which is good , " said Lee , whose running total now stands at $5,500 . " It 's really unfortunate what happened to the West Virginia area . <p> " I 'm donating a little bit of money so I 'm happy I had a lot of birdies and hopefully I can put some eagles worth $1,000 to the fundraising effort in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hend struggled to replicate their day-one performances , posting rounds of 72 and 73 respectively to fall back through the field . <p> Spanish duo Jorge Campillo and Alejandro Canizares , meanwhile , matched the day 's best score of 66 to launch themselves into contention at six and four under respectively following underwhelming opening rounds . <p> Matt Fitzpatrick and Thongchai Jaidee were among the players to miss the cut .
