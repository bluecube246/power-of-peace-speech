This week , he is an ambassador for sharks at a U.N . wildlife conference .  Achmat Hassiem on Wednesday called for tighter controls on trade in some shark species as well as in mobula rays , saying their numbers are in sharp decline . Sharks get a " bad rap " in a popular culture that portrays them as killing machines , when in fact they are increasingly vulnerable , he said .  " I personally have no grudges against the shark , " said the 34-year-old Hassiem .  Sharks " kind of keep the ocean 's balance in order , " he said . " It 's really , really tragic , the rate that they of sharks are killed annually to meet the demand for shark fin soup and other products , according to Hassiem .  The U.S.-based Pew Charitable Trusts asked Hassiem six years ago to campaign for shark conservation . He has since traveled widely as a conservationist and motivational speaker while pursuing his athletic career .  Hassiem competed at the Beijing Paralympics in 2008 and won bronze in the 100-meter butterfly at the London Paralympics in 2012 . He recently returned to South Africa from the Rio games , where he finished eighth in the same race . It was his last Paralympic competition .  He is attending the Johannesburg meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , or CITES .
