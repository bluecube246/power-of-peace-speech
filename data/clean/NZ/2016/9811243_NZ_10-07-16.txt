Breaking News  Has ' Chewbacca mum ' become too big for her boots ?  The woman behind Facebook 's most watched video of all time , ' Chewbacca mum ' , is making the most of her new found fame .  Candace Payne has received over half a million dollars in gifts , donations , holidays and University tuition fees , since posting the now iconic video of her laughing uncontrollably while wearing a talking mask of the Star Wars character Chewbacca .  The video has been viewed more than 160 million times .  The stay at home mum has also appeared on talk shows across the US , sung the national anthem at a baseball game , and even posted a tribute in song to the victims of the recent shootings in Dallas .  But some observers are now calling Ms Payne greedy , after she began charging fans NZ$27 per-seflie at a recent comic-con festival in Dallas . The line of fans waiting to meet her dwarfed those of the real Chewbacca , actor Peter Mayhew , and Game King Joffrey .  Ms Payne is reportedly donating a portion of her new found fortune to a Christian ministry , but must surely still be laughing all the way to the bank .
