<h> Organiser hopes Taranaki 's Big Night Out will raise $20k for Hospice <p> TARYN UTIGER <p> Last updated 11:40 , July 20 2016 <p> Robert Charles/FAIRFAX NZ <p> The Big Night Out organiser and artist Ray Hopkinson , left , is hoping to get a full house for the concert . Hospice Taranaki CEO Kevin Nielsen , vocalist Bruce Sutton and the New Plymouth Club 's Bill Foley will be helping to fill the seats . <p> The last time old Taranaki bands came together they partied almost until sunrise , but this time Ray Hopkinson reckons they will be home a little bit earlier . <p> " It was huge . Half-past three we finished last time . This time we 've got a licence until 1am , " Hopkinson said . <p> Back in 2006 , 700 people packed the New Plymouth Club to dance in nostalgia to the musical delights of local bands from the 1950s through to the 80s . <p> Supplied <p> Former Taranaki man Midge Marsden will headline The Big Night Out . <p> The sold-out event was called The Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry Hignett , and it raised $15,000 for Taranaki 's Te Rangimarie Hospice . <p> This time the event , on August 20 , is called Big Night Out and Hopkinson is hoping to raise $20,000 for the charity . <p> " If we can sell our 700 tickets , we will be smiling , " he said . <p> " The last one we had was ten years ago and that was a bands reunion . It 's sort of been in the back of our minds to do it again . I thought , well , if we are going to do it , let 's do it now . <p> " To get some of the old bands back was difficult . Some of the guys had moved out of the country , some of them have passed away . So , we thought , we 've got enough really good local talent here , so I 've managed to contact all of these different groups . Old and new . <p> " Some go back a long time , to the days of the hotels and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Included in the line-up for the August show is the crowd favourite of the 2006 gig - Taranaki 's Midge Marsden . <p> There will also be Kount Five Plus Two , Shaskeen Reel , Words with the Birds , Midlife Crisis , Class Act , Emily Riordan and Charlie Winters Best of British Group . <p> Hopkinson said he expected it would be the biggest night of the year for people " of his age group " . <p> " Now the local bars cater for the younger ones and people in our age group are starved of a really big night out . We thought this was an opportunity to not only support the Hospice , but to give people the chance to let their hair down and have a good night out . " <p> Taranaki Hospice chief executive Kevin Neilsen said he was impressed with the great line-up . <p> " The Last Gasp Reunion 10 years ago was an outstanding success and when Ray approached us saying that he and his colleagues had found they have a few more " last gasps " and were keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neilsen said . <p> He said Hospice Taranaki would provide care and support to more than 500 Taranaki people and their families in the next year , and in order to provide these services free of charge , $1.6 million needed to be raised within the community . <p> " While our fantastic Hospice shops contribute a large part of that amount , we still need support from other events . " <p> * Big Night Out is on at the New Plymouth Club , Saturday , August 20 . Doors open at 5.30pm . Tickets are $30 and on sale now at the New Plymouth Club , as well as the Hospice shops throughout the region .
