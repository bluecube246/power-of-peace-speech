organiser hopes taranaki 's big night out will raise $20k for hospice  taryn utiger  last updated 11:40 , july 20 2016  robert charles/fairfax nz  the big night out organiser and artist ray hopkinson , left , is hoping to get a full house for the concert . hospice taranaki ceo kevin nielsen , vocalist bruce sutton and the new plymouth club 's bill foley will be helping to fill the seats .  the last time old taranaki bands came together they partied almost until sunrise , but this time ray hopkinson reckons they will be home a little bit earlier .  " it was huge . half-past three we finished last time . this time we 've got a licence until 1am , " hopkinson said .  back in 2006 , 700 people packed the new plymouth club to dance in nostalgia to the musical delights of local bands from the 1950s through to the 80s .  supplied  former taranaki man midge marsden will headline the big night out .  the sold-out event was called the last terry hignett , and it raised $15,000 for taranaki 's te rangimarie hospice .  this time the event , on august 20 , is called big night out and hopkinson is hoping to raise $20,000 for the charity .  " if we can sell our 700 tickets , we will be smiling , " he said .  " the last one we had was ten years ago and that was a bands reunion . it 's sort of been in the back of our minds to do it again . i thought , well , if we are going to do it , let 's do it now .  " to get some of the old bands back was difficult . some of the guys had moved out of the country , some of them have passed away . so , we thought , we 've got enough really good local talent here , so i 've managed to contact all of these different groups . old and new .  " some go back a long time , to the days of the hotels and the included in the line-up for the august show is the crowd favourite of the 2006 gig - taranaki 's midge marsden .  there will also be kount five plus two , shaskeen reel , words with the birds , midlife crisis , class act , emily riordan and charlie winters best of british group .  hopkinson said he expected it would be the biggest night of the year for people " of his age group " .  " now the local bars cater for the younger ones and people in our age group are starved of a really big night out . we thought this was an opportunity to not only support the hospice , but to give people the chance to let their hair down and have a good night out . "  taranaki hospice chief executive kevin neilsen said he was impressed with the great line-up .  " the last gasp reunion 10 years ago was an outstanding success and when ray approached us saying that he and his colleagues had found they have a few more " last gasps " and were keen neilsen said .  he said hospice taranaki would provide care and support to more than 500 taranaki people and their families in the next year , and in order to provide these services free of charge , $1.6 million needed to be raised within the community .  " while our fantastic hospice shops contribute a large part of that amount , we still need support from other events . "  * big night out is on at the new plymouth club , saturday , august 20 . doors open at 5.30pm . tickets are $30 and on sale now at the new plymouth club , as well as the hospice shops throughout the region .
