but he made it clear he was in no position to be exhorting nationalism as a means of motivation for the men in white .  " as i said when i took over i 'm not english , i 'm australian . i will be absolutely committed to them but i am not going to talk to them about things i do n't understand . we 've got staff who can do that and if we think it is appropriate we will but it 's not something i 'll be staying up at night worrying about , " jones said .  " i 'm not going to use it ... it 's not a significant part of our preparation . it 's what we do out on the field during the week that will count . i 'm not denigrating what 's been done in the past , it 's whatever the players want to do . "  but after engineering satisfactory wins over scotland and italy in edinburgh and rome , he seemed delighted to be at " home " for the first no doubt why england regard twickenham as their fortress , despite their inability to defend it at last year 's world cup .  during his time in charge of the wallabies he won just one of three games against england in london .  " it was always a difficult place to play and win at . i think i only won one game there and i can still remember the try that won us the game . you felt the intensity of the crowd support and it was always bleak and miserable , " jones said .  " traditionally , england always played better there . it was a heavy pitch , it was hard to move the ball and it was hard for australian sides to play there . but it 's going to be beautiful and sunny on saturday in our minds .
