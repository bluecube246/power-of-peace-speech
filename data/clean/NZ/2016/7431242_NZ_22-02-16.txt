<p> But he made it clear he was in no position to be exhorting nationalism as a means of motivation for the men in white . <p> " As I said when I took over I 'm not English , I 'm Australian . I will be absolutely committed to them but I am not going to talk to them about things I do n't understand . We 've got staff who can do that and if we think it is appropriate we will but it 's not something I 'll be staying up at night worrying about , " Jones said . <p> " I 'm not going to use it ... it 's not a significant part of our preparation . It 's what we do out on the field during the week that will count . I 'm not denigrating what 's been done in the past , it 's whatever the players want to do . " <p> But after engineering satisfactory wins over Scotland and Italy in Edinburgh and Rome , he seemed delighted to be at " home " for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt why England regard Twickenham as their fortress , despite their inability to defend it at last year 's World Cup . <p> During his time in charge of the Wallabies he won just one of three games against England in London . <p> " It was always a difficult place to play and win at . I think I only won one game there and I can still remember the try that won us the game . You felt the intensity of the crowd support and it was always bleak and miserable , " Jones said . <p> " Traditionally , England always played better there . It was a heavy pitch , it was hard to move the ball and it was hard for Australian sides to play there . But it 's going to be beautiful and sunny on Saturday in our minds . "
