Bye-bye Winter and hello Spring  September heralds the start of a new season as we bound from winter into spring . MetService Meteorologist Peter Little commented , " It looks like we 're going to have a very typical start to spring this year , with a mixture of fine and wet weather forecast for most places over the coming days , accompanied by swinging temperatures and gusty winds . "  Northwesterly winds strengthen today ahead of a frontal system that moves onto the lower South Island this evening , then weakens over the North Island during Friday . While this feature brings a period of rain to western parts of the country , the northwesterly winds ahead of the front are expected to turn up the temperature in eastern areas .  " A Watch for heavy rain is in force for Fiordland , the Ranges of Westland and the Tararua Range , plus for severe northwest gales about Wairarapa and inland parts of Canterbury . Meanwhile , on Friday temperatures could reach twenty degrees in eastern parts of the country , such as Little .  On Saturday , a narrow ridge of high pressure sees fine weather return to most regions , with morning frosts likely about inland parts of the South Island . On Sunday , a low pressure system and its associated front move onto the country from the Tasman Sea . This weather system brings further rain , mainly to western areas , with heavy falls likely on the West Coast of the South Island . In addition , another period of gusty northwesterly winds and mild temperatures are likely in the east .  " If you 're planning outdoor activities around the weather this weekend the best time will likely be Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning " , added Mr Little .
