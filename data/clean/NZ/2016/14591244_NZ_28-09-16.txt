Mickelson promises prepared US team at Ryder Cup  CHASKA , Minn . ( AP ) " Two days before the Ryder Cup , Phil Mickelson went back 12 years to drive home a point that the Americans are prepared to play their best golf .  And along the way , he disparaged yet another former captain .  This time , his target was Hal Sutton .  Mickelson was the catalyst for change at the last Ryder Cup when he publicly questioned Tom Watson 's heavy-handed style " with Watson sitting at the same table " after another American loss at Gleneagles . That led to the PGA of America creating a task force allowing for player involvement .  " When you look back on what the difference is , when players are put in a position to succeed , more often than not they tend to succeed , " Mickelson said . " And when they are put in positions to fail , most of the time they tend to fail . "  In a conversation Wednesday on how much a the room and said , " Let me give you an example , if I may . "  He went back to 2004 when the Americans suffered their worst loss ever in the Ryder Cup at Oakland Hills .  Nothing illustrated their failure more than when U.S. captain Hal Sutton put Mickelson and Tiger Woods together for the first time . They lost two matches in one day .  Mickelson was lampooned that week for practicing on an adjacent course as he tried to adjust to the golf ball used by Woods .  " We ended up not playing well . Was that the problem ? I mean , maybe , " Mickelson said . " But we were told two days before that we were playing together , and that gave us no time to work together and prepare . "  Mickelson said having to learn how to hit a different golf ball forced him to abandon his own preparations to get sharp .  Continued below .

What allows me to play my best is to learn the course , sharpen my touch on the greens , sharpen my chipping out of the rough and ball-striking and so forth . Instead , I 'm taking four or five hours , and I 'm out trying to learn another ball to allow us to play our best . "  Mickelson said he was n't trying to knock Sutton . He said he liked how decisive Sutton was that week .  " But that 's an example of starting with the captain . That put us in a position to fail . And we failed monumentally , absolutely , " he said . " But to say , ' Well , you just need to play better , ' that is so misinformed . Because you will play how you prepare . "  Sutton was bemused that Mickelson would bring that up now .  " My God , somebody 's got to be the fall guy , " he told Golfweek magazine . " If . I do n't have anything to say to that . My God . The world saw what happened . They saw it . I did n't have to cover it up . ... I find it amusing that that 's an issue at the 2016 Ryder Cup . I think Phil better get his mind on what he needs to have it on this week instead of on something that happened 10 years ago . ...  " It could n't be their fault , " he said . " It had to be somebody else 's fault . It had to be Hal Sutton 's fault . Had to be . "  U.S. captain Davis Love III said Mickelson was only trying to set the record straight because " some analysts just keep bringing it up over and over and over again , " though Mickelson mentioned Oakland Hills unprompted in his news conference .  And Mickelson failed to mention that he switched equipment from Titleist to Callaway a week before the matches .  " Hal was an incredible captain , " said Love , who think Phil is looking forward to what 's happened over the last year and we 've learned a lot from all of our past captains on how we need to do this together . "  He said Sutton was with the U.S. team on Tuesday night and " it was an inspiration to see him . "  Mickelson is more optimistic than ever that the Americans can end two decades of futility against Europe , which has won eight of the last 10 times . Mickelson is playing his record 11th straight Ryder Cup , qualifying for every one of those teams , yet he has been on the winning side only twice .  Two years ago , he was visibly angry after the loss at Gleneagles about the U.S. getting away from what worked under Paul Azinger in a rare 2008 victory , and what seems to work every year at the Presidents Cup against an international team that is not nearly as formidable as Europe .  Love was captain at Medinah in 2012 when the Americans had a 10-6 lead going into singles , only rallied to win . Mickelson and Woods were part of that task force that agreed to bring Love back .  " This is a year where we feel as though Captain Love has been putting us in a position to succeed , " Mickelson said . " He 's taken input from all parties . He 's making decisions that have allowed us to prepare our best and play our best , and I believe that we will play our best .
