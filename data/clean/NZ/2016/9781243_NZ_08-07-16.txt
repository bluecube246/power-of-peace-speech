hayden roulston returns in ' toughest olympic team we 've had to pick '  hayden roulston has completed a remarkable oiympic comeback , being named in the nz team going to rio after his last games venture was in beijing in 2008 .  a target of four olympic medals has been set by cycling new zealand after announcing what they labelled the toughest team they 've ever had to select .  the return of veteran pursuiter hayden roulston - eight years after he won silver and bronze in beijing - is the feature of the 20-strong cycling team for rio along with an old-fashioned bolter : young sprinter zac williams who is reserve for the gold medal favourite sprint team .  the strength of the squad was underlined by those who missed out . bronze medallist in the keirin in london four years ago , simon van velthooven was n't required along with fellow sprinter matt archibald who stood on the podium at last year 's world championships .  ryan pierse/ getty images  world champion and commonwealth games gold medallist linda fourth at the london olympics time trial in 2012 .  after an injury-plagued year , commonwealth games silver medallist jack bauer missed out on the solitary men 's road spot to in-form tour de france rider george bennett for the punishing rio course , while alex frame and nick kergozou were the two unlucky pursuit riders .  new zealand 's men 's pursuit team were world champions in 2015 but bombed at this year 's event , leaving them needing sharp improvement to be a medal force in rio .  obvious medal targets are the world champion sprint team of eddie dawkins , sam webster and ethan mitchell ; dawkins in the keirin after being twice runner-up at world champs ; and world road time trial champion linda villumsen . the men 's and women 's pursuit teams are both seen as podium chances .  cycling nz high performance director mark elliott said is was the hardest olympic team to pick due to limited spots . the track team was limited to a quota of eight men and seven women , and the selectors decided to use in williams as a designated reserve .  " we have to be backing ourselves for four medals . we achieved three in london and four is certainly the goal , " elliott said .  robyn edie/fairfax nz  southland 's pieter bulling will be a key figure in the men 's olympic pursuit team in rio .  " the key thing for us is to progress from bronzes to silvers and golds . if we do that and produce four that 'll be a continuation of the momentum of this programme over the last four or five years . we still do n't have the depth and consistency of the rowing programme but we 're stepping in the right direction . "  cycling is second only to rowing in terms of their government funding for olympic campaigns .  at age 35 , roulston completed a remarkable comeback after switching to a road career post-beijing , where he won medals in the individual and team pursuits .  after appearing off the pace earlier this year , he made a late charge at the endurance camp in bulling , dylan kennett , aaron gate and regan gough as the pursuit five .  " there 's been a really tight group of guys with very little separating us all and i knew it was n't going to be easy , " roulston said .  " once the worlds team was named it was clear it would be harder rather than easier from that point on . i 'm very grateful to have had that support from cycling nz and show that i do still have it . it 's a pretty proud moment . "  roulston and gough were n't at the world championships in london where the team , defending their title from 2015 , flopped . it meant nervous times in camp in recent weeks , knowing two would miss out . roulston likened it to the reality show survivor .  " i have n't enjoyed this process as much as ' 08 , when we had a group of six and we knew we were all going . it 's really been good up until the last couple of weeks .  training hard and supporting each other , but there 's been some anxiousness at night talking about what 's going to happen . it was n't the nicest time . "  coach dayle cheatley said roulston had progressed quickly in recent weeks and the five were picked on form .  williams , from auckland , has only been part of the high performance programme in cambridge for two years but the selectors wanted cover for their sprint team who are the top priority . that meant bad luck for van velthooven and archibald who were making last-ditch efforts to qualify .  " zac has just nudged himself ahead in the final phase . he offers a lot to that sprint team and we were looking for a reserve . it 's a tough call around matt and simon who are long-serving members of that sprint squad , but it was selected on form and performances , " cheatley said .  villumsen , who 's been campaigning in the united states , heads the women 's team and is a huge chance of a podium after last year already-named sprinter natasha hansen is joined by olivia podmore to form a two-woman sprint team , while the five-strong pursuit lineup was predictable . selectors picked the same five who were third fastest in qualifying at this year 's world championships in the waikato trio of rushlee buchanan , jaime nielsen and racquel sheath , mid-canterbury 's lauren ellis and auckland 's georgia williams .  under coach brendon cameron there are high hopes they can push for a podium spot after their fourth placing at the worlds in london .
