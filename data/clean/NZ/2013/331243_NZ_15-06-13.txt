<p> OPINION : Until recently in New Zealand it 's been usual to insure your home on the basis of total replacement cover . This meant that you would provide information to your insurance company about the size of your home and , if it was destroyed , then your insurer would arrange to demolish the damaged structure and rebuild you a new dwelling to the same size and specification as it was before . <p> There was no limit on the amount your insurer was required to spend in order to replace your home . <p> Since the Christchurch earthquakes , many New Zealand insurers have changed the basis of their home insurance policies ; they now require you to specify a " sum insured " for your home . This means that if your home is damaged or destroyed then the sum insured is the maximum amount the insurer will be prepared to spend to remedy the damage . <p> The onus is now on you to tell your insurer the cost to rebuild your house . If you under-estimate the cost and your house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home to the same size and specification as it was before . <p> It 's also worth noting that the rateable value of your home does n't have a direct bearing on the cost to rebuild , therefore it is not a good idea to rely on the RV for insurance purposes . Instead you should investigate the actual cost of rebuilding your home to set your sum insured . <p> There are two methods to help you set the sum insured : <p> 1 . Online calculators : Some insurance companies provide online calculators to help you work out the likely cost of rebuilding your home . If you choose this option , you may want to ensure you cover any recent house additions or renovations . If you 're contemplating any major renovations within the next 12 months , make sure these are covered as they 're likely to increase the cost to rebuild your home to its current standard . <p> 2 . Property valuer : An alternative to using an online calculator , particularly if your home is an older house with period features or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specialist property valuer . A valuer can provide you with a more accurate valuation of rebuild costs than an online calculator so you can use that information to establish the sum insured . <p> When renewing your home insurance policy you should also remember that you have a duty to disclose all material facts to the insurer which may affect the risk being insured . <p> For example if you are planning substantial renovations at your property , or perhaps anticipate leaving the property vacant for a period while you are overseas on holiday , then you should disclose that information to your insurer . <p> If you forget to provide that information it may mean you could jeopardise your insurance cover if you make a claim on your policy . <p> The need for you to set a sum insured when you renew your home insurance policy is a good reminder to review all the information you have provided to your insurer about your home , such as your excess , and also a review of your household contents insurance . <p> It 's important to get your sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes wrong . Using an online calculator or a professional valuer will help you get the most from your policy . <p> Elspeth Horner is a partner in Wellington law firm , Morrison Kent .
