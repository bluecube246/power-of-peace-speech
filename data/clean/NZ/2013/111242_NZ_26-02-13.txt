Firefighters test new flying drones  Christchurch firefighters test their new drones , which can collect aerial footage without putting firefighters or the public at risk .  Relevant offers  The public could be forgiven for thinking UFOs had entered Christchurch airspace this week , as firefighters test new flying drones they say could help save lives .  The Canterbury Fire Service has bought two $25,000 unmanned aerial vehicles , with training planned at various city sites .  Effectively miniature helicopters , the Darley Stingers are designed to give fire command units ' ' a view from above ' ' at fire , search and rescue scenes .  With an inbuilt global positioning system ( GPS ) and either a high-definition camera or thermal imager attached , they can help direct crews , find hot spots and search for survivors in anything from rubble to cliffs .  Firefighters testing them at the old AMI Stadium today said they were also relatively simply to fly .
