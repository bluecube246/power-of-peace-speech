you ca n't always name the good ones . the ones who toil away in the background , who do it all without you really noticing .  while her name might not be a household standard , scene-stealing roles in whale rider and boy , and a regular seat on maori television 's panel show ask your aunties , have certainly made rachel house memorable . the shouty woman riding the red ride-on mower in that sky television ad ? that 's her , too .  on the day we were meant to meet , house needs to be in australia . a couple of " nice aussie boys " have invited her over to sydney to audition for a top-secret television pilot . it turns out those lads are the bondi hipsters - the duo behind the beached az cartoon that gently mocked us kiwis in front of an online audience of seven million .  they can name her , and they want her , too . it 's not an invitation she gets every day then ? " no . no , voice . " ' oh hi , do you want to fly to sydney in the next 24 hours please and be in our thing ? ' no , definitely not . i get really great jobs , just not involving travel . shit no . "  after more than 20 years in the industry , house still finds it hard to believe she is wanted in front of the camera . she reckons she is " an unusual-looking woman " , and there 's not a lot of room for those these days .  " it still surprises me when i get cast in something . i 'm not your , you know , i 'm ... i remember thinking really early on that you have to look a particular way and i 'm quite aware of my look , so i always thought i would n't get a lot of screen work .  " but , of course , when i 'm directing i never take those things into consideration . it 's just like , who 's good , who 's going to bring it we are hard on ourselves . "  like many of the characters she 's played , house is n't the flashy type . a ponsonby local , she picks a " really quiet , unpretentious " cafe for a coffee and a chat a day earlier than planned . it 's tucked away from the ladies that lunch and their miniature dogs who could n't be further from the way she goes about things . in the flesh , the 41-year-old is captivating and instantly familiar . wrapped up in a black puffer jacket , with her mane of dark curls tucked away , she has a face you recognise quickly , despite the pair of sunglasses hugging it tightly . she also uses the word " totes " a lot ; probably jokingly , possibly not .  in her latest film , set for release on the 27th of this month , house is front and centre - there is no background here . white lies is a confronting production based on witi ihimaera 's novella medicine woman , written and directed by mexican filmmaker dana rotberg .  house plays maraea , the servant of rebecca ( antonia prebble ) , a wealthy woman who needs the help of medicine woman paraiti ( whirimako black ) to hide a secret that will destroy her life in european settler society . originally , house auditioned for the role of paraiti , but director rotberg was adamant that part would be played by a fluent te reo speaker from the tuhoe tribe . house was neither and she turned down the chance to play maraea when she was first offered it . rotberg managed to talk her round .  " it 's not like i read the script and went , ' who 's the lead ? i want that role . ' i never do that because it 's not the kind of actor i am . and i 'm happy with that , happy with little walk-on roles , staunch aunties with hearts of gold , " she says .  without spoiling the film 's twist ( in house 's words , " it 's like the sixth sense " ) , the role of maraea can get . this was a step into the unknown .  " actors wrestle with it all the time ; they want to be liked , " she says . " they do . they want to play something that people are going to like . and again , that 's not something that 's ever made my mind up , but in this case maraea 's pretty bad . she 's extreme . "  the themes of race and identity in white lies are not completely foreign to house . adopted by scottish parents , john and sheila , she was raised in kamo , whangarei . while she always felt maori , she says it took her a while to really connect with the culture . " i 've never not felt maori , ever . and because of the era i grew up in , i was never not seen as that . i would walk down the street with mum and dad and people would say , " look , there 's a little maori girl . "  my parents were quite keen to maori at university before she adopted me , and dad 's just a good old socialist , you know . a leftie .  " i 've been trying to make my way towards the culture since high school , but my perceptions of what being maori meant were quite different to , i think , what they are . "  it was her parents who steered her towards ballet , piano and speech and drama lessons from the age of five to help her gain confidence . as she says , she did n't catch the acting bug - she was shoved into its path . with other kids there were performances on local verandas in front of proud parents , before house moved on to the northland youth theatre . from there toi whakaari new zealand drama school seemed like an " obvious route " .  " but i did n't really take the craft of it seriously fora while . it took me a while to really get it , " she says . when she got involved in casting maori theatre , with its strong was always interested in the stories we were telling , it just needed to be bigger ; it needed to be a bigger concept for me to take it seriously , i think . when the outcome actually meant something and it was n't just ' me-me-me ' . " then you understand what you are doing - you are a storyteller , you can bring people together and you can educate . it allows us to put ourselves in other people 's shoes and have a different outlook on the world . it 's powerful . "  in her own story , there are only a few things she would change . she wishes she had gone to university as well as drama school . gone and studied " things that are interesting " - political science , religious studies , maybe women 's studies . things to broaden her horizons . " i think it 's important ; just studying acting is really stupid . you 've got to get a sense of the world , like anything . be a better human ; read more . " " , house is more comfortable steering the ship from the director 's chair . in the past year alone , she has worked on hui , an urban maori play that premiered at the auckland arts festival , and was artistic director of the te reo maori version of shakespeare 's troilus and cressida , which appeared at london 's globe theatre in 2012 .  last year was topped off when house received an arts foundation laureate award , an honour that recognised her whole career - from the groundbreaking directorial work to those roles audiences did n't immediately associate with her .  " i could not believe it . you reach a certain age and everybody wants you to be on a panel , and i thought that 's why they were calling . when they told me i was very accusatory . i told them to shut up , and i swore a lot . and cried a lot , too . i blubbered like a baby . "  after appearing in films like boy and eagle vs shark , house is used to laughing a laugh ) , but this year is set to be a bit different - along with white lies , house will also appear in hope and wire , the mini-series based around the christchurch earthquakes .  these days she lives and breathes her work a lot more than she used to . " i do n't want to do things by halves . i really love the work that i do , and i feel like you have to go that extra mile to do it because it is a responsibility . telling stories is a responsibility . there are certainly times i have had to do things half-assed , but in the past few years it has n't been an option . if you are going to do it , do it well . "  the ultimate aim is directing a feature-length film . in 2008 she attended the prague film school , where the constant need to churn out stories and scripts meant she could work without second-guessing herself . back home , those doubting thoughts are harder to ignore .  " when i was work , so there was no room for voices of doubt . just do it by the end of the week , and you do . that was really liberating , having that pressure . maybe it was shit , but you just did the best you could with it . now , when there is n't that pressure , i 'll just sit . writing i find hard , because it 's so personal and there are so many voices of doubt .  " it 's probably because i 've read so many scripts over the years and now i 'm in a position where i 'm asked to critique , so you 're already critiquing your work before you 've even started . the number of times i 've thought . ' oh , i 'm going to write this story ... ' ' why ? no one 's going to want to hear that ; it 's dumb . what a silly story . ' so i just have to harden up . "  she 's equally as self-deprecating when it comes to her chances at the strong sense that , for house , flash and cash will always come second to a good yarn .  " i just do n't think i 'd be very good at it . you have to be very technically brainy , and i 'm not technically brainy , unfortunately . wow , would n't it be amazing to play with all that money , but i 'd be wasting a lot of people 's time . if it was a hollywood blockbuster with a really good story , sure . but it has to have a good story .
