<p> Last week when my three-year old knocked out my tooth . Not from the pain , but from the thought of the dentist 's bill . I suggested we all take a break from wrestling and watch a movie . We watched ET which made me cry again . <p> Do you have a party trick ? I really like break dancing . Of course I completely fail at it , but busting out a backspin in the middle of a dance floor is my speciality . <p> If you could live in a ' book world ' which would it be ? Cat in the Hat . <p> Tell us about the best year of your life . Happening right now . Living in a great city , working on projects that mean a lot to me , surrounded by superb people . <p> What 's your favourite ice cream flavour ? Gelato Messina in Darlinghurst , Sydney , has the best ice cream in the world . Myfavourite flavour is called ' The Boss ' Wife ' . It has everything in it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Twitter ( it has all the links and websites I follow en masse ) and the obligatory time waster , Facebook . <p> Give your teenaged self some advice . " By all means follow your dreams , but buy as many shares as you can in a company called GOOGLE ! " <p> The last thing you declared going through Customs ? I make a point of not travelling with anything declarable but I was recently caught with a rogue rotten banana in the bottom of child 's backpack . I might as well have been travelling with a bomb .
