last week when my three-year old knocked out my tooth . not from the pain , but from the thought of the dentist 's bill . i suggested we all take a break from wrestling and watch a movie . we watched et which made me cry again .  do you have a party trick ? i really like break dancing . of course i completely fail at it , but busting out a backspin in the middle of a dance floor is my speciality .  if you could live in a ' book world ' which would it be ? cat in the hat .  tell us about the best year of your life . happening right now . living in a great city , working on projects that mean a lot to me , surrounded by superb people .  what 's your favourite ice cream flavour ? gelato messina in darlinghurst , sydney , has the best ice cream in the world . myfavourite flavour is called ' the boss ' wife ' . it has everything in it .  then twitter ( it has all the links and websites i follow en masse ) and the obligatory time waster , facebook .  give your teenaged self some advice . " by all means follow your dreams , but buy as many shares as you can in a company called google ! "  the last thing you declared going through customs ? i make a point of not travelling with anything declarable but i was recently caught with a rogue rotten banana in the bottom of child 's backpack . i might as well have been travelling with a bomb .
