It 's a programme that provides music tuition for children who ca n't afford it by members of the Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra .  The programme provides opportunities to children who would n't otherwise have them .  Luka Sefo and Kobe Ru are two of 90 South Auckland students who 've been chosen to receive the free tuition .
