<h> Man jokes despite having nail in his brain <p> An X-ray shows a nail embedded in Dante Autullo 's brain . Autullo posted a picture of the X-ray on Facebook during his ambulance ride between hospitals for surgery . ( AP Photo/Christ Medical Center &amp; Hope Children 's Hospital ) <p> Gail Glaenzer still ca n't believe that her fianc ? unknowingly shot a nail into his skull , let alone that he posted a picture of the X-ray on Facebook during his ambulance ride between hospitals for surgery . <p> But she was joking about the circumstances Friday , a day after doctors successfully removed the 3 ? -inch nail from Dante Autullo 's brain . <p> " Dante says , ' I want it to make a necklace out of it , ' " Glaenzer said . <p> Glaenzer sat on Friday in the lobby of Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn , Illinois , where Autullo , 32 , of Orland Park , was listed in fair condition in the hospital 's intensive care unit . She was still trying to process just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He feels good . He moved all his limbs , he 's talking normal , he remembers everything , " said Glaenzer , 33 . " It 's amazing , a miracle . " <p> Autullo was in his workshop using the nail gun on Tuesday when it recoiled near his head , Glaenzer said . <p> He felt what he thought was the point of the gun hit his head . But what really happened was that when the gun came in contact with his head , the sensor recognized a flat surface and fired , she said . <p> " I looked at it when he got home , and it just looked like ( his head ) was cut open , " she said . <p> With nothing to indicate that a nail had not simply " whizzed by his ear , " as Autullo explained to her , she cleaned it with peroxide . <p> While there are pain-sensitive nerves on a person 's skull , there are n't any within the brain itself . That 's why he would have felt the nail strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrate the brain . <p> Neither thought much about it , and Autullo went on with his day , even plowing a bit of snow . But the next day when he awoke from a nap , feeling nauseated , Glaenzer sensed something was wrong and suggested they go to the hospital . <p> At first Autullo refused , but he relented after the two picked up their son at school Wednesday evening . <p> A couple hours later an X-ray was taken , and there in the middle of his brain was a nail . Doctors told Autullo and Glaenzer that the nail came within millimeters from the part of the brain that controls motor function . He was rushed by ambulance to the other hospital for more specialized care . <p> Hospital spokesman Mike Maggio said the surgery took two hours , and the part of the skull that was removed for surgery was replaced with a titanium mesh . The surgeon did n't want to put that part of the skull back in place , fearing it might have been contaminated by the nail , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how scared he was about what might have happened , he did express a recognition about coming close to death . <p> " He was joking with me , ( after surgery ) , ' We need to get the Discovery Channel up here to tape this , ' " she recalled him saying . " ' I 'm one of those medical miracles . ' "
