" ultimately , i would love to see lots of families down at friendly bay with their picnic rugs , chilly bins , frisbees and rugby balls , really enjoying the day , " waitaki event development officer jan kennedy said .  as well as the opening of signal hut , the harbour regatta and the birdman competition , visitors to friendly bay would be entertained with live music , including johnny and the cashtones , gatling fun , jef mitchell and kit mcgregor .  children 's activities and food , beverage and coffee vendors would also be on offer .  of the events planned for the regatta included seagull outboard motor races , rowing races , sailing dinghy races , bathing beauties ( men and women in traditional and retro costumes ) and sand castle building .  traditional and classic boats would be on the water , as well as on display . there would also be a display of coracle seamanship .  the scott 's own sea scouts would also be on the water in their sailing cutters .  the regatta is organised by the friendly bay boat society , which is based at the tyne street boatshed .  the birdman competition , in which competitors throw themselves off a ramp on holmes wharf , is organised by port fm and , in the past , has been staged on a different day from the boat regatta .  this year , the two will be held on the same day to boost the fun .
