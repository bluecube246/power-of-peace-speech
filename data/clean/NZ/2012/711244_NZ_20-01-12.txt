<h> Double the fun at Friendly Bay event <p> Daniel O'Brien won the best dressed award and the trophy for best overall birdman last year . Photo by Peter McIntosh . <p> Waitangi Day at the beach is the appeal of the Oamaru Harbour regatta and birdman competition to be held this year on February 6 . <p> Both competitions are staged annually , but this year a co-ordinated approach is being taken to attract people to Friendly Bay at Oamaru Harbour . <p> " Ultimately , I would love to see lots of families down at Friendly Bay with their picnic rugs , chilly bins , frisbees and rugby balls , really enjoying the day , " Waitaki event development officer Jan Kennedy said . <p> As well as the opening of Signal Hut , the harbour regatta and the birdman competition , visitors to Friendly Bay would be entertained with live music , including Johnny and the Cashtones , Gatling Fun , Jef Mitchell and Kit McGregor . <p> Children 's activities and food , beverage and coffee vendors would also be on offer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the events planned for the regatta included Seagull outboard motor races , rowing races , sailing dinghy races , bathing beauties ( men and women in traditional and retro costumes ) and sand castle building . <p> Traditional and classic boats would be on the water , as well as on display . There would also be a display of coracle seamanship . <p> The Scott 's Own Sea Scouts would also be on the water in their sailing cutters . <p> The regatta is organised by the Friendly Bay Boat Society , which is based at the Tyne Street Boatshed . <p> The birdman competition , in which competitors throw themselves off a ramp on Holmes Wharf , is organised by Port FM and , in the past , has been staged on a different day from the boat regatta . <p> This year , the two will be held on the same day to boost the fun . <p> " It seems logical that with all of the individual events that are happening on this special day that we should look at a co-ordinated marketing approach , " @ @ @ @
