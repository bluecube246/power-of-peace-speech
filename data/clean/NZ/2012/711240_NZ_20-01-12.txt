<p> Say " biltong " to a South African and most will start salivating , but the cured , air-dried beef snack is not an easy product to introduce to a new market . <p> Canterbury Biltong director David Stanley said selling his product was difficult initially . <p> " It was very difficult in the beginning because ... 80 per cent of people did n't know whether it was wood , or bark , or eel . " <p> Biltong is cured , spiced beef which is air-dried . It is not the same as beef jerky , which is cut into thin strips , marinated and then cooked or smoked . <p> The biltong-making business started off as an after-hours sideline but when it grew beyond that Stanley left his day job and went into biltong manufacturing full time . After a couple of years it grew so busy he persuaded his wife , Nicole , to join him . <p> Stanley travelled New Zealand to raise awareness of the product , taking part in food shows and food markets to get the Canterbury Biltong brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and the September 4 quake only required a two-week closure for a cleanup . <p> Initially , they and their landlord had thought the building was repairable but with repeated aftershocks and uncertainty over the zoning of the land it became apparent it would be a long time before the business would get back into its original premises , if at all . <p> Canterbury Biltong did not have business interruption insurance . <p> " My broker had sent me a reminder the week before saying it would be a very good idea , " Stanley said . <p> But a table of costs and benefits that should have been attached to the letter was missing , so Stanley had put it aside in his " to-do " pile . <p> " After the quake I rushed upstairs to get the server and documents and recipes . The letter from my broker was sitting on the floor , I could see it . " <p> The business made use of the Government 's wage subsidy , which had been " fantastic " . They survived on savings , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material damage and contents took a long time to come through but did eventually . <p> In August , Stanley approached Recover Canterbury for help . The organisation helped Canterbury Biltong apply for a grant from the Canterbury Business Recovery Trust , and the business received a $25,000 grant from the trust which helped offset the costs of relocating to its new Phillipstown premises . <p> As a food producer it had been very difficult to find appropriate new premises that complied with the necessary hygiene standards , but eventually it reopened in its new Phillipstown premises in September . Surviving until then had been " really difficult " , because they could not make or sell any product . <p> Rent at the new premises is double what it was at the Ferry Rd site but the new factory is export standard with room to grow , and the business is hoping to export its first shipment to Australia this year . <p> At the time of the quake Canterbury Biltong was in negotiations with a distribution company and the distributor has not abandoned them . The company has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around New Zealand .
