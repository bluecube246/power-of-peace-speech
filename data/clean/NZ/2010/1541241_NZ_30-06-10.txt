Another move has been taken by Marlborough Lines Ltd. , as it purchases an additional 5% of the Whakatane-based electricity distribution Company . With this , the former continues to trail its antagonistic target Horizon Energy Distribution Ltd .  Earlier in this month , Marlborough Lines had already bought Horizon Energy 's 10.1% through a stand in the bazaar , worth $4.06 per share . Now , Company has again asked First NZ Capital Securities Ltd to obtain around 1.25 million more shares , which accounts to be 5% of the Company .  These purchases will be done through an exclusive order program , which has been initiated today . These facilities are kept preserved for the situations in which shares are bought under conditions . This is just like the stands in the souk . It 'll be unwrapped till 16 July .  The shareholders can attain an elevated amount , if within six months from 12 June Marlborough Lines procures Horizon Energy shares worth $4.06b or more . On the other hand , Eastern Bay Energy Trust possesses 77.3% shares of Horizon .  When a similar partial bid occurred last year for the Whakatane-based electricity network operator , at that time , the Marlborough Lines could not succeed .
