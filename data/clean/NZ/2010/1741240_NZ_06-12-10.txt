Photo by Craig Baxter <p> Irrepressible Bulls GP Dr Dave Baldwin likes being behind bars , and not just because it gives him a captive audience . <p> He visited the Otago Corrections Facility in Milburn on Sunday to deliver to about 40 inmates one of his " very non-PC " talks on how to be a " healthy bastard " . <p> Dr Baldwin , who has lost count of how many addresses he has given since his down-to-earth book spelling out men 's health issues , Healthy Bastards , was published last year , said he appreciated being able to speak inside prisons because it gave him a chance to get his message to the " real oil " . <p> " Do n't get me wrong , but when I talk to a lot of groups , I am talking to a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for the Department of Corrections " getting in behind me " , support which had not yet been forthcoming from the Ministry of Health , ACC or a corporate backer . <p> Although sometimes those who asked him to speak paid some expenses , he really needed financial backing to push his campaign to get the unhealthy to change their " evil ways " . <p> Dr Baldwin believed his approach , using some basic humour to help get across a serious message , was more effective than " fancy pamphlets or glossy brochures " for many men , particularly those who might not be competent readers . <p> Sunday 's talk was scheduled to fit in with one of Dr Baldwin 's regular visits with the Bulls Flying Doctor Service , which involves him flying from Bulls , near Palmerston North , to the South in his Cessna to undertake medical checks for pilots in rural areas . <p> However , this time , unusually , he had an entourage , his own film crew , which is working on a film encompassing the beauty of the South Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthiest bastard in the bush " , and his mission to get men to pay the same attention to their bodies as they would a favourite car or motorbike . <p> He decided on the film , which will be completed early next year , after plans for a television series , based on his book , fell through . <p> At Milburn , he drew some applause when he showed some of the high country footage filmed from the air which is to be included in the film . <p> The talk was well-received , with several people asking questions , and many taking the opportunity to speak briefly to Dr Baldwin afterwards .
