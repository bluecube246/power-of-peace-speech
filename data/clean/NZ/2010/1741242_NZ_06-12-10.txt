Photo by Craig Baxter . <p> A bright idea by a Dunedin police sergeant will help prevent cyclists dying on New Zealand roads , the New Zealand Police roading manager predicts . <p> A five-minute 3-D clip , which gives viewers a chance to see the potential hazards facing cyclists and motorists alike , was yesterday launched in Dunedin . <p> Given the recent spate of cycling deaths , the release of the DVD was " timely " , road policing national manager Superintendent Paula Rose said . <p> " If it prevents one crash , it will be worth it . " <p> The idea for the DVD came from Sergeant Jan Craig , after she read about funding available for road safety initiatives . <p> Her idea of creating a 3-D cycle-safety DVD was made possible with a $75,000 grant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Supt Rose , an avid cyclist , said she regularly saw bad behaviour from cyclists and motorists . <p> It was apparent people needed to learn how to better share the road . <p> " Initiatives like this will certainly help improve road safety , prevent crashes and save lives . " <p> The DVD , filmed around Dunedin and which features sobering crash statistics , is likely to be distributed nationally and made available for driver training , to cycling organisations and for school educational programmes . <p> Sgt Craig , a family violence intervention co-ordinator , recognised the importance of road safety after witnessing first-hand lives being ruined as a result of a momentary lack of judgement on the country 's roads . <p> " It just takes a second to change someone 's life forever . " <p> The DVD was to have featured one of her friends , but a replacement had to be found after she was injured in an accident with a motorist in Forbury Rd , Dunedin . <p> The DVD features potential hazards such as motorists tail-gating , opening car doors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said cyclists were protected only by lycra and a helmet and the launch of the DVD was welcome . <p> While New Zealand motorists had a reputation as being " impatient " , cyclists should also obey traffic rules . <p> The recent cycling fatalities made her " feel sick to the stomach " and education was the key to prevent future incidents , she said .
