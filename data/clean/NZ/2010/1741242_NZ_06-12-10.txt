hopes 3-d dvd will help save cyclists ' lives  new zealand police road policing national manager superintendent paula rose and dunedin and clutha area commander inspector dave campbell watch a 3-d clip on cycle safety developed by dunedin company taylormade media . photo by craig baxter .  a bright idea by a dunedin police sergeant will help prevent cyclists dying on new zealand roads , the new zealand police roading manager predicts .  a five-minute 3-d clip , which gives viewers a chance to see the potential hazards facing cyclists and motorists alike , was yesterday launched in dunedin .  given the recent spate of cycling deaths , the release of the dvd was " timely " , road policing national manager superintendent paula rose said .  " if it prevents one crash , it will be worth it . "  the idea for the dvd came from sergeant jan craig , after she read about funding available for road safety initiatives .  her idea of creating a 3-d cycle-safety dvd was made possible with a $75,000 grant .   supt rose , an avid cyclist , said she regularly saw bad behaviour from cyclists and motorists .  it was apparent people needed to learn how to better share the road .  " initiatives like this will certainly help improve road safety , prevent crashes and save lives . "  the dvd , filmed around dunedin and which features sobering crash statistics , is likely to be distributed nationally and made available for driver training , to cycling organisations and for school educational programmes .  sgt craig , a family violence intervention co-ordinator , recognised the importance of road safety after witnessing first-hand lives being ruined as a result of a momentary lack of judgement on the country 's roads .  " it just takes a second to change someone 's life forever . "  the dvd was to have featured one of her friends , but a replacement had to be found after she was injured in an accident with a motorist in forbury rd , dunedin .  the dvd features potential hazards such as motorists tail-gating , opening car doors and said cyclists were protected only by lycra and a helmet and the launch of the dvd was welcome .  while new zealand motorists had a reputation as being " impatient " , cyclists should also obey traffic rules .  the recent cycling fatalities made her " feel sick to the stomach " and education was the key to prevent future incidents , she said .
