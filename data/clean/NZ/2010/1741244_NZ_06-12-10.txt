An 80m-long , 3m-high jet blast safety fence now dominates part of the landscape on Kawarau Rd , near the Queenstown Airport .  The $800,000 structure , officially opened yesterday , is designed , as its name suggests , to shield vehicles and pedestrians from airflow emitted by jet engines during take-off .  The fence , which took three months to build , replaces a large earth mound and is built of lightweight fibreglass which can withstand wind or take-off blast of up to 160kmh .  Chris Read , the Queenstown Airport Corporation 's general manager , aeronautical , said the fence had been imported from Canada and assembled by Fulton Hogan contractors .  It cost about $330,000 and a further $470,000 was spent on assembly , landscaping , planting and labour costs .  The fence is self-cleaning and maintenance-free , and is designed to collapse safely upon impact without major damage to aircraft .  It is part of the QAC 's ongoing safety work to meet international aviation requirements of the runway end safety area ( Resa ) , which of the runway for safety reasons .  The earth barrier was deemed old-fashioned .  Pupils from Remarkables Primary School were yesterday invited to plant the final native tussock grass beside the fence while Mr Read unveiled a plaque to mark their involvement .
