spyshots : is this the new peugeot 308 sedan ?  this is the first time we 've seen this prototype on test . it appears to have the new peugeot family front-end , and judging from its size , it appears to be some kind of c-segment sedan . might we be looking at a peugeot 308 sedan on test , or perhaps the new peugeot 408 ?  other than the outline of the front grille and bumper , there are some other details peeking through the heavy zebra-like disguise . we know the headlamps have integrated daytime running lights , as those are peeking through , and from the rear angle we can see bits of the tail lamp design , which look like they 're lit up with led technology .  this car is n't to be confused with the peugeot 301 , which is a ' conquest car ' , peugeot 's term for entry-level cars aimed at increasing market share in emerging markets such as bric countries . the incrementing number method of naming models are now gone -- the ' 1 ' suffix being conquest cars , while models with ' 8 ' at the end of the numbering badge are premium cars .  the previous-generation 308 actually had two different sedans built on it . one was a 308 sedan , and another was a larger 408 , which was based on the 308 . we 've covered both cars before in our previous posts , but only the 408 is on sale in malaysia . theophilus chin rendered a peugeot 308 sedan earlier this month -- see how one could look like in the gallery below .  after dabbling for years in the it industry , paul tan initially began this site as a general blog covering various topics of personal interest . with an increasing number of readers paying rapt attention to the motoring stories , one thing led to another and the rest , as they say , is history . an avid electronic gadget aficionado as well as big-time coffee lover , he 's also the executive producer of the driven motoring tv programme .  but how is this new peugeot 308 ford focus and vw golf ? ? ? you can only sell a peugeot in malaysia la , the rest of the world dislike peugeot junks . not even the french prefer a japanese half blood like renault over peugeot .  308 ? my suggestion for present 408 .... do someting with the back lights ... make them bigger . everytime i wanted to consider about this car , i stay back because of the backlights ... even preve looks nicer from behind .... you know what i mean ...  you can either post as a guest or have an option to register . among the advantages of registering is once a name has been registered , a guest can not post using that name . if you have an account , please login before commenting . if you wish to have a profile photo next to your name , register at gravatar using the same e-mail address you use to comment .
