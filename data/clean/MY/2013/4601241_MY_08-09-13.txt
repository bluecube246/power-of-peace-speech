<h> No fish story <p> Published : 9 September 2013 10:22 AM <p> Affected modern gastronomy aside , the concept of feeding the world has changed drastically . <p> It has grown from a romantic , albeit naive , notion into a mortifying epiphany of sorts . A little like when you realise that the extinction of sharks , thanks to our reckless indifference , has opened the doors to the global domination of the rabidly propagative ( and highly predatory ) giant Humboldt squid . ( And while I 'm all for a little grilled squid from time to time ; I want my goby , grouper and four-finger threadfin as well . ) <p> The fear of collapsing ecosystems notwithstanding , the more immediately alarming truth to haunt my recurrent gastro hallucinations is that in a rapidly populated earth -- 7 billion and counting -- a sustained majority of the civilised market has developed a somewhat ravenous penchant for seafood . <p> According to the United Nations ' The State Of World Fisheries And Aquaculture 2012 report , fish affords about 3 billion of us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.3 billion people with about 15% of such protein . <p> All in all , we are looking at about 148 million tonnes of fish ( in 2010 , that had a total value of US$217.5 billion ) , of which about 128 million tonnes were used as food for people , with preliminary data for 2011 indicating an increased production of 154 million tonnes , of which 131 million tonnes were destined as food . <p> And before we start excusing ourselves from the equation , let us recognise that Singapore is one of the biggest seafood consumers in Asia Pacific , devouring an average of 100,000 tonnes of seafood each year , based on studies by the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) . <p> Now , there 's nothing wrong with fishing per se ; it is fishing with the need to sustain not life but a lifestyle that has muddied the waters . <p> Making it count <p> Like overfishing , particularly from over-exploited and poorly managed fisheries , by-catch ( the netting of unwanted marine creatures while fishing for a specific species ) remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such industries is far from a realistic resolution . <p> As part of a global push to promote real alternatives , experts have placed their faith in sustainable farming . This has its own set of environmental risks , but , thankfully , there are aquaculture industries committed to ensuring optimal environmental , social and economic sustainability leading by example . <p> Salmon , though , represents the most efficient use of marine raw materials for food production . In fact , when it comes to feed-to-meat conversion , the fish is twice as efficient as pig or poultry . <p> Add that to the quality proffered by leading producers like Norway and it would be easy to fathom the constant growth in consumption . To wit , according to the Norwegian Seafood Council ( NSC ) , seafood from Norway 's model farms is an increasingly popular choice among Singaporeans . <p> Import of Norwegian salmon alone has been increasing at an average of 17% a year since 2005 , which equates to 6,343 tonnes in 2012 ( up from 2005 's haul of just 2,685 tonnes ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's growing appetite . But are the advantages lost in the influx ? Compared to last year 's estimates , Singapore imported just three tonnes of halibut compared to 793 tonnes of trout and around 7,353 tonnes of salmon . <p> Closer to home <p> Still , progress made in eating local as part of efforts to reduce our carbon footprint has been encouraging . Major supermarkets are keeping up efforts , partnering with local fish farmers ' cooperatives , as well as acquiring fish from nearby Malaysia , Indonesia and Thailand . <p> In September 2011 , for example , Cold Storage became the first supermarket to roll out a sustainable seafood initiative . " ( It ) was also the first supermarket to start a ' no shark 's fins ' policy in all the Cold Storage and Market Place stores in Singapore , " said a spokesperson for the company , who added that , as a member of the WWF Singapore Sustainable Seafood Group , Cold Storage is committed to improve how it sources sustainable seafood and promote responsible consumption in Singapore . <p> In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sea , now a main international certification project for products originating from both sustainable fisheries and aquaculture . <p> Meanwhile , all fish supplied to FairPrice Finest and FairPrice Xtra stores are tagged with QR codes , which customers can scan for instructions on how to best prepare the fish . These QR-coded fish are sold under the brand The Fish Farmer , which is owned by the Metropolitan Fishery Group ( MFG ) , and includes Singapore farmed grey mullet , milk fish and black tilapia , as well as farmed California bass , seven-star sea perch and spottail bass from Taiwan . <p> MFG also has a new local farm rearing red and silver snapper and rabbit fish , which a FairPrice spokesperson confirmed will be ready next year . Another local farm , Rong Yau Fisheries , supplies the supermarket chain with golden pomfret , live seabass and pearl grouper . <p> Others like Barramundi Asia proffer a select range . Established in 2007 , it is the first EU certified fish farm in Southeast Asia , and the first in Singapore to grow barramundi in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main island . <p> " The price is half of what the Australian air-flown product is ; therefore we can price it accordingly on our menus , " shared executive chef Peter Rollinson of The Halia At Singapore Botanic Gardens . <p> The Australian native also highlighted the fact that the fish arrive at the restaurant the day they are harvested . " They ca n't get any fresher than that . And texture and taste is on par with the Australian product . " <p> The fish was also a recent highlight in the Singapore Farm Fresh edition of Project Food Prints by The Halia Group , in the third installation of a six-part dinner series aimed at encouraging transparency from farm to fork . Rollinson affirmed that the said barramundi will also remain on the menu , joining other sustainable ingredients , such as prawns from Spencer Gulf in South Australia . <p> Urban enterprise <p> It may have begun as a backyard experiment of sorts , but two-and-a-half-year-old OnHand Agrarian has quickly grown into a uniquely viable local enterprise , harvesting an organic ecology of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been dubbed an " integrated multi-trophic recirculating aquaculture system " , or IMTRAS , for tropical marine species . The aim is to harvest seafood more efficiently , humanely , cleanly and profitably . <p> " We will make seafood so cheap , only the rich will go fishing , " runs the tag by director and founder Shannon Lim on its Facebook page . <p> But the wonderful irony of this system is its ability to turn an understanding of natural waste into a winning business model . At a talk last year , Lim shared how it worked : " The weird thing about farming fish is that the more s**t something eats , the more valuable it becomes . So fish that do n't eat any s**t are worth about S$20 a kilogramme , and then you have the crustaceans that eat the fish 's ( droppings ) that are worth about S$40 a kilogramme . Eventually , you end up with urchins that eat a lot of s**t that are worth S$80 a kilogramme . " <p> This is not a new concept . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that for the price of producing one type of fish , Lim has proven that OnHand Agrarian can safely produce a platter , from quality organic grouper to crab , lobster and prawn . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .
