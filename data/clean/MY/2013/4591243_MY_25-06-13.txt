<h> Opposition questions ministers with questionable degrees <p> Three Opposition MPs are questioning the wisdom of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak for naming two ministers with questionable university degrees to his Cabinet . <p> They are calling for the resignation of Minister of Human Resources Richard Riot , who is said to have questionable undergraduate and master degrees , as well as Dr Ewon Ebin , the new Minister for Science , Technology an Innovation ( MoSTI ) , whom they alleged had a fake masters degree and doctorate . <p> Serdang MP Dr Ong Kian Ming , speaking at the Parliament lobby , said that in an official website Riot was listed as having a Bachelor of Business Administration from the Chartered Insitute of Business Administration ( Ireland ) and a Masters in Business Administration from Preston University in USA . <p> " Not only could we not find any website belonging to the Chartered Insitute of Business Administration ( Ireland ) , Preston is a well-known bogus university reported by numerous newspapers , " Ong said . <p> He added that in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor in Business Administration from Golden State University , Wyoming . Ong said that although not listed on the MoSTI website , they were informed that the minister obtained his Masters in Business Administration from the Commonwealth Open University based in the British Virgin Islands . <p> He added that both these institutions are listed as ' unauthorised schools and invalid degrees ' by the state goverments of Oregan and Maine in the US . <p> Bukit Bendera MP Zairil Khir Johari said this was a big scandal because it involved two ministers who are responsible for ministries that look into human capital development in the country . <p> " And each of them has two fake qualifications , so the issue here is integrity , because on Monday we took oaths as MPs to serve the people with honesty , " Zairil said . <p> He added even if they applied for entry level officers in the government as administrative officers , they would not qualify . " But these two are ministers now , " he said , adding that MoSTI was an important ministry which gave out millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tan said that Riot , as MP for Serian , should know that a minister with questionable degree will not get the confidence of foreign investors . <p> " How can we entrust Sarawak taxpayer 's money , and more importantly Sarawak 's future when he has a questionable degree ? Something must be done , and now . " <p> Tan called for Riot and Ebin to relinquish their ministerial posts . - June 26 , 2013 . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .
