<p> If you paid attention during geography lessons at school , you might remember the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn . While also titles of once-banned novels by author Henry Miller , these tropics are really circles of latitude on Earth marking the most northerly and southerly positions the Sun may appear directly overhead . <p> So that takes care of pirates and sex . But why are these imaginary lines of great interest to coffee lovers worldwide ? <p> Well , besides literature and navigation , the area bounded by the tropics also forms a band known as the Bean Belt . This region offers some of the best temperature , rainfall and sunshine for coffee growing . The soil is also typically rich and porous . <p> Here you may find the best of the world 's coffee . <p> " Can you taste where this coffee is from ? " <p> To date , there are over 50 countries where coffee may be farmed but each country or region imparts their own unique characteristic to the beans due to the difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harvesting and processing methods also matters . <p> This can be rather fun for those of us who love guessing games . <p> Discover the coffee 's origins by reading the label on your bag of beansRecently while having my usual cuppa at RAWcoffee , I was asked by barista Michael Tan to identify the origin of my coffee , along with other caf ? regulars . Some of us offered continents -- South America , Central America or Africa . Others tried to be more specific naming countries or even specific regions . <p> None of us got the answer right , but here 's a guide that may help you if you find yourself in a similar situation . <p> Latin America ( both Central and South ) is considered the juggernaut of the coffee world . <p> Some caf ? menus provide information about the coffee 's origins and flavour profileThe coffees from this region tend to be light and tangy . This makes them perfect as a base for coffee blends . Some exciting producers include Panama ( famed for its Geisha coffee ) , Costa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese , who import over 80 per cent of its production ) , and Guatemala . <p> On the flip-side , coffee-producing countries in Asia offer a thicker coffee , more full-bodied and often with very distinct notes . This makes them ideal for pairing with Latin American beans , to add heft to coffee blends . Indonesia is the dominant player here in terms of interesting beans ; the expensive kopi luwak being the most notorious and much-maligned example . <p> My personal favourite is East Africa . I find the coffees here to be more complex . You can get really unusual notes such as citrus , cocoa , blueberry and even scented spices here ! When in doubt , I usually guess Africa though you can go deeper -- is it a Kenya or more of an Ethiopia ? <p> One of the friendliest baristas in town , Tan is a fan of Central American beans . Coffee made with these beans tends to have a balanced acidity and sweet aftertaste . <p> " Top of my list is coffee from El Salvador and Guatemala , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk , having a very sweet taste and medium body . The latter is better as an espresso shot , syrupy with a winey flavour . " <p> Map of the world 's coffee regions , a.k.a . " The Bean Belt " <p> World 's top coffee producers <p> When it comes to coffee production , most will think of Latin America or even Africa . So it may come as a surprise that two of the top three coffee producing countries in the world are , in fact , in Asia . <p> Coming in third place is our neighbour Indonesia . Some of the finest Arabica beans in the world are planted in this archipelago , with different islands offering different growing conditions . For example , contrast a smoky Mandheling from Sumatra with its spicier , sweeter cousin from Java . <p> Fellow ASEAN nation Vietnam takes the runner-up spot . As Vietnamese beans are generally not considered specialty coffee , their growing global market share ( nearly 15 per cecnt ) is largely due to Robusta beans destined for use as commodity coffee . Your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former French colony . <p> The world 's largest producer of coffee is none other than Brazil . This coffee giant accounts for a third of coffee production worldwide , most of it Arabica beans . Ideal climate and mineral-rich soil ensure their continued dominance . Brazil 's prominence also means better processing and production facilities , guaranteeing a highly consistent quality of coffee . <p> So , the next time you have a cuppa , why not pause and reflect on the journey the beans have taken to reach your local caf ? ? It may be as exciting a journey as the taste of your coffee . <p> This story was first published in Crave in the print edition of The Malay Mail on September 6 , 2013.
