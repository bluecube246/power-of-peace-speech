<h> ' Inflationary pressure in Malaysia not systemic ' <p> KUALA LUMPUR ( Dec 9 , 2013 ) : Malaysia 's inflationary pressure may be building up but it will not severely affect the economy that is poised to expand by 4.2% next year , said Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ( ICAEW ) chief economist Douglas McWilliams ( pix ) . <p> He does n't see inflation in Malaysia becoming a systemic problem , that is , affecting the whole economy , and that it will be absorbed . <p> " There will be some upward pressure on inflation and we 'll see higher numbers in 2014 , more so in 2015 , but they wo n't become systemic because we do n't think the level of demand here is so high , " he told a media briefing after presenting ICAEW 's quarterly forecast report titled the " Southeast Asia Economic Insight " here on Friday . <p> " We 're a bit more cautious on economic growth and we do n't think it 'll be demand pressure that will lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> In October 2013 , Malaysian annual inflation rate accelerated for the second straight month to 2.8% , from 2.6% in September , as transport prices increased , still reflecting the cut in fuel subsidies . <p> McWilliams said inflation will be slightly higher due to currency movements as well as structural adjustments as subsidies are reduced and the goods and services tax ( GST ) is being implemented . <p> Meanwhile , he opines that Malaysia has a chance of seeing a 5% gross domestic product growth in 2016 . <p> " There 's a chance of a 5% growth in 2016 because by then much of the budget consolidation process would have been achieved and the GST would 've been implemented . <p> " The economy would be moving to normal by 2016 so there is a good chance of returning to a more traditional rate of growth , " said McWilliams , who is also executive chairman of the Centre for Economics and Business Research Ltd ( CEBR ) , ICAEW 's global economic partner . <p> CEBR has forecast Malaysia to post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 and 4.1% in 2016 . <p> " 2014 is a transition year for Malaysia to be used productively to move in from consolidating government finances and reducing subsidies as well as increasing taxation on consumer spending . For 2014 , the strongest driver is exports . " <p> " We are predicting exports of RM723 billion for 2013 ( growth of 2.9% over 2012 ) and RM766 billion for 2014 , a growth of 6% . " <p> He added that the implementation of the GST in 2015 will further hamper consumption growth but consumer spending will still be a contributor to growth .
