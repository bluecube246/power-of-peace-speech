' inflationary pressure in malaysia not systemic '  kuala lumpur ( dec 9 , 2013 ) : malaysia 's inflationary pressure may be building up but it will not severely affect the economy that is poised to expand by 4.2% next year , said institute of chartered accountants in england and wales ( icaew ) chief economist douglas mcwilliams ( pix ) .  he does n't see inflation in malaysia becoming a systemic problem , that is , affecting the whole economy , and that it will be absorbed .  " there will be some upward pressure on inflation and we 'll see higher numbers in 2014 , more so in 2015 , but they wo n't become systemic because we do n't think the level of demand here is so high , " he told a media briefing after presenting icaew 's quarterly forecast report titled the " southeast asia economic insight " here on friday .  " we 're a bit more cautious on economic growth and we do n't think it 'll be demand pressure that will lead to the , " he said .  in october 2013 , malaysian annual inflation rate accelerated for the second straight month to 2.8% , from 2.6% in september , as transport prices increased , still reflecting the cut in fuel subsidies .  mcwilliams said inflation will be slightly higher due to currency movements as well as structural adjustments as subsidies are reduced and the goods and services tax ( gst ) is being implemented .  meanwhile , he opines that malaysia has a chance of seeing a 5% gross domestic product growth in 2016 .  " there 's a chance of a 5% growth in 2016 because by then much of the budget consolidation process would have been achieved and the gst would 've been implemented .  " the economy would be moving to normal by 2016 so there is a good chance of returning to a more traditional rate of growth , " said mcwilliams , who is also executive chairman of the centre for economics and business research ltd ( cebr ) , icaew 's global economic partner .  cebr has forecast malaysia to post 2014 and 4.1% in 2016 .  " 2014 is a transition year for malaysia to be used productively to move in from consolidating government finances and reducing subsidies as well as increasing taxation on consumer spending . for 2014 , the strongest driver is exports . "  " we are predicting exports of rm723 billion for 2013 ( growth of 2.9% over 2012 ) and rm766 billion for 2014 , a growth of 6% . "  he added that the implementation of the gst in 2015 will further hamper consumption growth but consumer spending will still be a contributor to growth .
