<h> ROS Lboard <h> Property gains tax in M'sia <p> September 18 , 2013 <p> Owning property can be either a liability or a great investment ; either way , if you are planning to dispose of your property , you might be wondering if you will get taxed on the disposal of a property . <p> FEATURE <p> By Hann Liew <p> Owning property can be either a liability or a great investment ; either way , if you are planning to dispose of your property ( whether it is to cut your losses or to make a profit ) , you might be wondering if you will get taxed on the disposal of a property . To answer this , SaveMoney.my explains Real Property Gains Tax in Malaysia in this week 's guide . <p> What is Real Property Gains Tax ( RPGT ) ? <p> Real Property Gains Tax is a form of tax levied by the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia ( Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri ) on net capital gains derived from the disposal of real property ( which generally means any land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain ? To calculate this , you are allowed to subtract certain expenses from the gross capital gain ( do n't forget to keep the bills ! ) such as : <p> Expenditure incurred to maintain / upgrade the property . This can include upgrade works done to the property such as renovations and interior design works . <p> After this point , the maximum allowable deduction here is the larger of RM10,000 or 10% of the net capital gain . <p> Why do we have RPGT in Malaysia ? <p> There are many reasons why RPGT is imposed . One of the more significant reasons why the government imposes this tax is to curb property speculation , and in turn to avoid property bubbles forming . However from time to time , the government may decide to increase or decrease RPGT to suit their agenda , e.g. they could reduce RPGT to encourage investments ( this actually happened for a period of time between 1 April 2007 -- 31 December 2009 , wherein property transactions during this period were exempted from RPGT to spur investments ) , which is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious reason is that RPGT is a source of revenue for the government . <p> When and where do you pay RPGT ? <p> Given the nature of RPGT , i.e. it is a tax on capital gains from disposal of property , it can obviously only be paid after you have sold off the property . You are allowed a 60-day grace period , within this time you must settle the tax that you are meant to pay from your sale of property . <p> Your conveyancing lawyer or tax agent should be able to submit the relevant CHKTK form on your behalf and pay any dues to Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri ( LHDN ) from the proceeds of your property sale . However , it is always best to make sure , so do check with your lawyers or tax agents on this matter , rather than assuming and then getting into trouble ! <p> Now if you are wondering just how RPGT is calculated , and how much you 'll have to pay , stay tuned for the next instalment of SaveMoney.my 's guide where we will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liew is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of SaveMoney.my , an online consumer advice portal which aims to help Malaysians save money through smart ( and most of the time painless ) savings in their daily banking , technology , and lifestyle spending habits . <h> Comments <p> Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story .
