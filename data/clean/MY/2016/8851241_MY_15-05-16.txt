nissan president carlos ghosn , speaking to reporters after the acquisition deal was formally announced late last week , said that the deal will result in big savings from a vehicle development point of view , with aspects of design , engineering and production being shared between the two automakers . it will also provide nissan with a quicker inroad into the development of plug-in electric vehicles , an area mitsubishi is already involved in .  analysts say that the buying into mitsubishi , which comes after mmc 's fuel economy scandal surfaced last month , is a rather opportunistic move and something of a bargain , given the sum forked out to acquire a third 's share of the beleagured automaker .  nonetheless , mitsubishi chairman osamu masuko says that such a merger was inevitable , and " would have happened one day . " he added that the deal was " an important step toward rebuilding trust and stabilising our business . "  the deal will see nissan effectively becoming the largest shareholder of mmc -- ahead of the likes of mitsubishi ufj -- once it is completed . reports indicate that nissan will have four nominees as board directors in proportion to its voting rights , and there will also be a nissan-appointed chairman of the board .  anthony lim believes that nothing is better than a good smoke and a car with character , with good handling aspects being top of the prize heap . having spent more than a decade and a half with an english tabloid daily never being able to grasp the meaning of brevity or being succinct , he wags his tail furiously at the idea of waffling - in greater detail - about cars and all their intrinsic peculiarities here .  you can either post as a guest or have an option to register . among the advantages of registering is once a name has been registered , a guest can not post using that name . if you have an account , please login before commenting . if you wish to have a profile photo next to your name , register at gravatar using the same e-mail address you use to comment .
