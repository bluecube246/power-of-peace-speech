<h> ROS LBoard 1 <h> Waiting for a photo-finish at polls <p> June 18 , 2016 <p> Enough evidence to show that the disgruntled and the dissenters can move a significant share of votes . <p> FMT LETTERS <p> from : Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad , via email <p> It 's always an anxiety in trying to predict the outcome of elections , whether a general election or those taking place in between them . There are times when my predictions have been somewhat accurate , notwithstanding those occasions where I erred . <p> The results of today 's two by-elections are about the most complex to predict , as they may set a whole new trend in voting patterns which could either be sustained for the next general election -- or the outcome could very well be a one-off phenomenon or a flash in the pan . <p> The results shall be dependent on the audacity of the ' critical voters ' anticipated to translate their ' disagreement and frustration ' about their leadership , or for non-partisan voters ( aka fence-seaters ) who have been voting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely fence-seaters , these include : <p> * the ' disgruntled ' PAS members and supporters . ( Not equal to the ' Harumanis ' as they are very much PAS members , unlike Harumanis who are bent on crossing to Amanah or simply resigning . ) <p> * Umno 's members and supporters who , for clear reasons , are either now pro-Tun ( Dr Mahathir Mohamad ) ; or very anti-Najib for his excesses ( and thus most likely but not necessarily pro-Tun ) ; or who vehemently disagree about the selection of candidates . <p> There is enough evidence that this pool has sufficient reason to shift a significant share of votes from both PAS and Umno . Whether those votes will shift to Amanah and Pakatan Harapan is yet to be be seen and quantified . <p> The rest of the voter segments will largely be more or less the same , without much significant shift or movement . <p> Young voters are noted to be anti-Najib ( aka Anti-1MDB ) and anti-GST and in varying degrees in favour of Amanah being given a chance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially among the Chinese , and whether ' Outside Voters ' will come back and vote : the strong campaign by DAP and Pakatan should have addressed that concern . <p> Specifically though , the intimidation and threat by the Deputy Prime Minister , Ahmad Zahid Hamidi , about the Sekinchan fishermen that make up 25 per cent of Chinese voters , could also eat up Amanah 's Chinese vote share . Zahid 's resorting to the ' carrot and stick ' is extremely deplorable if not outright illegal . Numerous other examples abound . <p> Given the complex equations , it is most exciting to see whether the 13 days of campaigning by the eight-month old Amanah , flanked by the more seasoned partners of DAP and Keadilan , could stage an upset . <p> The involvement of Dr Mahathir Mohamad and the Selangor Menteri Besar Azmin Ali has made their respective contribution in addressing preconceived ideas particularly among certain segments of Malay voters . <p> Various polls and opinion pieces of analysts-academics have it that the underdog Amanah has an edge over PAS , while yet trying to narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a heart-throbbing photo-finish ending . <p> Let us all hope that the two by-elections , conducted in the blessed month of Ramadan , will not witness any untoward events . <p> May the best candidate win ...
