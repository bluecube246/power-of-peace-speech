ros lboard 1  waiting for a photo-finish at polls  june 18 , 2016  enough evidence to show that the disgruntled and the dissenters can move a significant share of votes .  fmt letters  from : dr dzulkefly ahmad , via email  it 's always an anxiety in trying to predict the outcome of elections , whether a general election or those taking place in between them . there are times when my predictions have been somewhat accurate , notwithstanding those occasions where i erred .  the results of today 's two by-elections are about the most complex to predict , as they may set a whole new trend in voting patterns which could either be sustained for the next general election -- or the outcome could very well be a one-off phenomenon or a flash in the pan .  the results shall be dependent on the audacity of the ' critical voters ' anticipated to translate their ' disagreement and frustration ' about their leadership , or for non-partisan voters ( aka fence-seaters ) who have been voting a genuinely fence-seaters , these include :  * the ' disgruntled ' pas members and supporters . ( not equal to the ' harumanis ' as they are very much pas members , unlike harumanis who are bent on crossing to amanah or simply resigning . )  * umno 's members and supporters who , for clear reasons , are either now pro-tun ( dr mahathir mohamad ) ; or very anti-najib for his excesses ( and thus most likely but not necessarily pro-tun ) ; or who vehemently disagree about the selection of candidates .  there is enough evidence that this pool has sufficient reason to shift a significant share of votes from both pas and umno . whether those votes will shift to amanah and pakatan harapan is yet to be be seen and quantified .  the rest of the voter segments will largely be more or less the same , without much significant shift or movement .  young voters are noted to be anti-najib ( aka anti-1mdb ) and anti-gst and in varying degrees in favour of amanah being given a chance .  especially among the chinese , and whether ' outside voters ' will come back and vote : the strong campaign by dap and pakatan should have addressed that concern .  specifically though , the intimidation and threat by the deputy prime minister , ahmad zahid hamidi , about the sekinchan fishermen that make up 25 per cent of chinese voters , could also eat up amanah 's chinese vote share . zahid 's resorting to the ' carrot and stick ' is extremely deplorable if not outright illegal . numerous other examples abound .  given the complex equations , it is most exciting to see whether the 13 days of campaigning by the eight-month old amanah , flanked by the more seasoned partners of dap and keadilan , could stage an upset .  the involvement of dr mahathir mohamad and the selangor menteri besar azmin ali has made their respective contribution in addressing preconceived ideas particularly among certain segments of malay voters .  various polls and opinion pieces of analysts-academics have it that the underdog amanah has an edge over pas , while yet trying to narrow see a heart-throbbing photo-finish ending .  let us all hope that the two by-elections , conducted in the blessed month of ramadan , will not witness any untoward events .  may the best candidate win ...
