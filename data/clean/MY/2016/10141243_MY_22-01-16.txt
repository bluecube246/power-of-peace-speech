the international ratings agency said on friday its revisions were us$40 per barrel of brent crude in 2016 and us$45 in 2017 .  however , it stated the recent revision of its oil price assumptions would not have an immediate impact on petronas ( foreign currency a-/stable/-- ; local currency a/stable/-- ; axaaa/-- ) .  " we expect petronas to maintain its critical policy role for malaysia , its large direct and indirect contribution to the country 's budget , and its integral link with the malaysian government through full state ownership , " it said .  s&amp;p said the ratings and the outlook on the company and its notes would continue to mirror malaysia 's sovereign credit rating on malaysia ( foreign currency : a-/stable/a-2 ; local currency : a/stable/a-1 ; axaaa/axa-1+ ) .  " we expect the rise in petronas ' net leverage to be very gradual over the next two years , given the company 's large cash position of about rm133bil as of sept 30 , 2015 .  " this is despite our forecast that petronas ' earnings rm55bil to rm60bil in 2016 and rm60bil to rm65bil in 2017 under our revised price assumption of us$40 per barrel of brent crude in 2016 and us$45 in 2017 .  " those levels are about 20% lower than we had earlier anticipated and compare with a reported ebitda of about rm125bil in 2014 , " it said .  s&amp;p forecasts petronas ' debt-to-ebitda ratio at 0.5 times to 0.6 times in 2016 under its revised price assumptions . the ratio will rise to about 0.8 times in 2017 because of lower ebitda and higher net debt .  " the ratio remains within our tolerance threshold of 1.0 times for a ' aa ' sacp . nevertheless , it is higher than the debt-to-ebitda ratio of about 0.5 times we had anticipated under our previous price assumptions , " it said .
