The international ratings agency said on Friday its revisions were US$40 per barrel of Brent crude in 2016 and US$45 in 2017 .  However , it stated the recent revision of its oil price assumptions would not have an immediate impact on Petronas ( foreign currency A-/Stable/-- ; local currency A/Stable/-- ; axAAA/-- ) .  " We expect Petronas to maintain its critical policy role for Malaysia , its large direct and indirect contribution to the country 's budget , and its integral link with the Malaysian government through full state ownership , " it said .  S&amp;P said the ratings and the outlook on the company and its notes would continue to mirror Malaysia 's sovereign credit rating on Malaysia ( foreign currency : A-/Stable/A-2 ; local currency : A/Stable/A-1 ; axAAA/axA-1+ ) .  " We expect the rise in Petronas ' net leverage to be very gradual over the next two years , given the company 's large cash position of about RM133bil as of Sept 30 , 2015 .  " This is despite our forecast that Petronas ' earnings RM55bil to RM60bil in 2016 and RM60bil to RM65bil in 2017 under our revised price assumption of US$40 per barrel of Brent crude in 2016 and US$45 in 2017 .  " Those levels are about 20% lower than we had earlier anticipated and compare with a reported EBITDA of about RM125bil in 2014 , " it said .  S&amp;P forecasts Petronas ' debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 0.5 times to 0.6 times in 2016 under its revised price assumptions . The ratio will rise to about 0.8 times in 2017 because of lower EBITDA and higher net debt .  " The ratio remains within our tolerance threshold of 1.0 times for a ' aa ' SACP . Nevertheless , it is higher than the debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.5 times we had anticipated under our previous price assumptions , " it said .
