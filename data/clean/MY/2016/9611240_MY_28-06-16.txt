<h> Swine fever case confirmed in South Korea <p> South Korea 's agriculture ministry today confirmed that a case of swine fever had been discovered on a hog farm on the southern island of Jeju , the first in the country since 2013 . <p> Testing confirmed so-called ' classical ' swine fever , also known as hog cholera , had been found on the farm , the ministry said in a statement . <p> A ministry official who declined to be identified said the disease , which is highly contagious among swine but harmless to humans , was unlikely to be widespread as other regions have vaccinated pigs against it . <p> The ministry statement said Jeju had stopped vaccinating against the fever nearly two decades ago . <p> Some 400 hogs have already been slaughtered in the wake of the discovery , with another 4,700 to be culled as a further precaution , the ministry official said . <p> Earlier this year , Asia 's fourth-largest economy found fresh cases of foot-and-mouth disease on hog farms . But another ministry official today said no new discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People want to lead a peaceful lives . The terrorists are short-sighted , and this is one of the causes of rampant suicide bombings . We can not solve this problem only through prayers . I am a Buddhist and I believe in praying . But humans have created this problem , and now we are asking God to solve it . It is illogical . God would say , solve it yourself because you created it in the first place.So let us work for peace within our families and society , and not expect help from God , Buddha or the governments . " <p> Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , when asked about prayers for those who died in the Paris terrorist attack , says the world must not ask God to fix man-made problems .
