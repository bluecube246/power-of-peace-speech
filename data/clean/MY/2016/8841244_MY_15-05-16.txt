<h> Europe 's top swimmers descend on London ahead of Rio Olympics <p> LONDON : As the Olympic Games loom ever closer , Europe 's best swimmers gather in London on one of the final stepping stones to Rio de Janeiro . <p> When the European Championships start on Monday at the London Aquatics Centre - which staged the swimming at the 2012 Olympics - there will be just 82 days before the Games start in Brazil . <p> Given the proximity , few who are competing in Rio will have rested before the London meet , but are instead in heavy training , eyes planted firmly on what lies ahead in August . <p> Two years ago in Berlin , Great Britain topped the medal table with a haul of 24 . <p> Prominent was 19-year-old Adam Peaty , a fortnight after beating Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh to second in the 100m breaststroke at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . <p> Peaty was a stand-out in Berlin , winning four gold medals and setting a world record in the 50m breaststroke , albeit not ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion Florent Manaudou also made four visits to the top of the podium , while Sweden 's Sarah Sjoestroem claimed three golds . <p> All three have had a stunning couple of years , but for Peaty the summer of 2014 was when he made a deafening entrance onto the international stage . <p> He went on to obliterate Van der Burgh 's 100m world record last year in London before three gold medals at the World Championships in Kazan , where he and the South African went toe to toe like prize fighters , trading 50m world records as boxers trade blows . <p> Now favourite for Olympic gold , Peaty has come a long way . <p> He told AFP : " It 's only two years but I 'm going to Europeans now in a completely different mindset , a completely different athlete . <p> " I 'm a lot more confident about where I 'm going and what I 've done to get me this far so I am looking forward to swimming this meet and I 'm not really focusing on medals or times , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me and Mel ( coach Mel Marshall ) have already got a thing in place to hopefully just race , gladiator-style . <p> " We are all going to be pretty tired but that does n't mean we are going to hand the medals over , we are going to put up a good fight and see what we get . I love competing so I 'll get a little bit more energy out of myself and see what happens . " <p> The last time Peaty competed at the Aquatics Centre he became the first man to go under 58 seconds for the 100m breaststroke , his time of 57.92 seconds taking 0.54secs off Van der Burgh 's mark in the same pool in 2012 . <p> A host of stars <p> The British Olympic team are competing in London , meaning a European debut for double world freestyle champion James Guy . <p> Manaudou is joined on the French team by Fabien Gilot , Jeremy Stravius and Mehdy Metella , the four making up the squad that won the 4x100m freestyle world title in 2015 . <p> Gregorio Paltrinieri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious absence of Sun Yang , spearheads the Italian men along with Gabriele Detti . <p> Hungary 's Laszlo Cseh looks to add to his 12 European titles in the butterfly and individual medley events . <p> Sjoestroem will look to add to her seven medals from Berlin ahead of a much-anticipated Olympics for the Swede after five world medals , including two golds , in Kazan . <p> Hungary 's Katinka Hosszu , nicknamed the Iron Lady because of her gruelling multi-event schedule , has a reduced programme in London , her eyes set on claiming her first Olympic medals .
