<h> LATEST CONTENT <h> " People want to lead a peaceful lives . The terrorists are short-sighted , and this is one of the causes of rampant suicide bombings . We can not solve this problem only through prayers . I am a Buddhist and I believe in praying . But humans have created this problem , and now we are asking God to solve it . It is illogical . God would say , solve it yourself because you created it in the first place.So let us work for peace within our families and society , and not expect help from God , Buddha or the governments . " <p> Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , when asked about prayers for those who died in the Paris terrorist attack , says the world must not ask God to fix man-made problems .
