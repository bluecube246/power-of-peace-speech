Paris to deploy more police to reassure Asian tourists  Source : Reuters  Adjust Font Size :  PARIS , 7 Nov 2016 :  France plans to bring in more police units and surveillance cameras to reassure Asian tourists put off by robberies and militant attacks and avoid a sharp drop in visitor numbers , daily newspaper Le Figaro said yesterday .  France is the most popular country in the world for tourists with almost 85 million visitors last year and the sector employs about two million people .  Tourism companies reckon visitor numbers will fall by 4-5% this year due to deadly militant attacks , notably in Paris and the Riviera city of Nice , coupled with a spate of robberies targeting Asian tourists .  Prime minister Manuel Valls , who will convene a government committee on tourism today , will grant about ? 43 million to fund security as well as an advertising campaign and measures to help restaurants and hotels , Le Figaro said , citing unnamed sources .  The extra police and cameras will mainly be focused , while the government will also develop a tourist security label to communicate the safety of sites , the paper said .  Tourism firms have called for dedicated police to combat robberies which have targeted Asians because of their reputation for carrying large sums of cash and buying luxury gifts .
