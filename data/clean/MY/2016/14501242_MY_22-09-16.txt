Ooi Kin Fai  In a recent interview with Indonesian football website Offside , Andik Vermansyah spoke about the latest in the Selangor camp as well as his new role in the squad .  Selangor beat PKNS FC over two legs to advance to the semi-final stage of the TM Malaysia Cup and will be looking to retain the trophy they won last year . Even with still two more Super League fixtures to go , Andik is well aware which games are the more vital ones .  " The next game for us is the one against Perak in the Super League on the 24th September . But more importantly for us is the one against T-Team who is under Rahmad Darmawan in the semi-final of the Malaysia Cup . "  Selangor are currently fourth in the Super League with a six point gap to third placed , Kedah . On that front it looks unlikely that The Red Giants could overhaul the The Red Eagles .  " The Malaysia Cup is the target for the team this season because the chance league has many good strong teams , especially JDT ( Johor Darul Ta'zim ) . "  Over the course of the season , Selangor not only made changes on the coaching front with K. Gunalan overseeing the team with Zainal Abidin Hassan being let go , Andik has also been given a chance to wear the captain 's armband .  " It did feel awkward at first to be playing as captain . However this is a matter of great hounour to me . I 'm very happy and proud to be able to wear the armband being an import player from Indonesia . "  With the domestic season wrapping up soon , attention will soon be switching towards the AFF Suzuki Cup with Indonesia and Andik looking to make headlines in that tournament .  " Every player is proud to represent their country and that 's the same for me . I 'm hoping I will be able to feature in the Suzuki Cup in Philippines later this year . "
