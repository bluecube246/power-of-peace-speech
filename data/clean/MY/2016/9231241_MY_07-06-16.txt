He said most consumers ended up paying more than the advertised airfare , as most airlines " pre-select " optional extras , such as travel insurance and seat selection .  Idris said these pre-ticked boxes or words with links were often buried in a wordy page and was easy to miss out .  When one realises the extras that have been added into the ticket price , it might be impossible to go back and uncheck the boxes , he said .  Idris said those who went back and unchecked these extras might lose the low airfare offered earlier , which leaves the consumers at the losing end .  " This is an obvious catch , because what you see is probably not what you get .  " Some airlines state the initial fares are merely indicators to help you make your choice , without showing miscellaneous fees -- and a fare higher than what you had bargained for .  " This statement attempts to exonerate the airline for springing last minute surprises , which is unfair to the customer , displayed " timed-out " so fast that customers did not have time to compare prices with other airlines for the best deal . Those who were not tech-savvy , he said , were the biggest losers in the end .  Meanwhile , Idris said the Transport Ministry ought to emulate the UK Consumer Contracts Regulations , where consumers could only be charged for items they choose .  " The legislators must do something to protect consumers . The nonchalance of the Transport Ministry on this issue is sad and worrying , " Idris said .
