<h> Sex workers used as baby factories <p> PETALING JAYA : Sex workers are now used as " baby factories " , with syndicates capitalising on the country 's stringent adoption procedures to make a quick buck . <p> Tenaganita coordinator Aegile Fernandez told theSun that this trend has taken a turn for the worse in the last three years . <p> This is because the pregnant women , who have been coerced into becoming " surrogate mothers " , must also continue to provide their normal sex services to clients while carrying their unborn baby . <p> The worry is that this can lead to problems like health issues or the baby becoming HIV-positive . <p> Another issue is that when , for whatever reason , the baby is rejected , it goes back to the syndicate to become a victim of child trafficking or brought up to be a future sex worker . <p> " The babies ' fate thus hinges on uncertainty even though a ' booking fee ' has been made by potential couples to adopt them , " she said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit , there are children being watched over by another sex worker . When the child is eight years old , they 're sold for sex . This is a ' long-term investment ' for the syndicates , " she said . <p> The whole " adoption " process begins with a word within a community that a childless couple " wants a child " . Often it means adopting one outside official procedures . <p> This is understandable because for some couples , waiting for the official adoption documentation after two years of trudging through paperwork , interviews , and being monitored by the Welfare Department can be agonising . <p> Specifics of a child include their gender , weight , health and sometimes skin colour . <p> For instance , a boy fetches a higher price of between RM12,000 and RM40,000 , while a girl is priced no more than RM25,000 . <p> The booking fee can be from RM5,000 to RM7,000 . <p> Previously , a sex worker found to be pregnant would would be sent to the abortion clinic . <p> " Now the syndicates send her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a doctor would provide a letter furnishing a different identity complementing the new parents , " Fernandez said . <p> The document is then sent to the National Registration Department , after which a birth certificate is issued . <p> Fernandez said it is difficult to obtain hard evidence that an exchange has been made . <p> However , she applauds the government for making the adoption process simpler with the Adoption Act amendments , allowing prospective couples to bring home their adopted child immediately instead of having to wait for the completion of the entire process before being allowed to do so . <p> " ( Nonetheless ) , there 's a belief among some Malaysians that it is better to adopt the child as an infant because they would then be able to shape the infant 's ' mentality ' , even their physical state , in a safe environment . <p> " This is as opposed to the other countries , where it 's considered acceptable to adopt an older child , " she said .
