Sex workers used as baby factories  PETALING JAYA : Sex workers are now used as " baby factories " , with syndicates capitalising on the country 's stringent adoption procedures to make a quick buck .  Tenaganita coordinator Aegile Fernandez told theSun that this trend has taken a turn for the worse in the last three years .  This is because the pregnant women , who have been coerced into becoming " surrogate mothers " , must also continue to provide their normal sex services to clients while carrying their unborn baby .  The worry is that this can lead to problems like health issues or the baby becoming HIV-positive .  Another issue is that when , for whatever reason , the baby is rejected , it goes back to the syndicate to become a victim of child trafficking or brought up to be a future sex worker .  " The babies ' fate thus hinges on uncertainty even though a ' booking fee ' has been made by potential couples to adopt them , " she said .  " Kit , there are children being watched over by another sex worker . When the child is eight years old , they 're sold for sex . This is a ' long-term investment ' for the syndicates , " she said .  The whole " adoption " process begins with a word within a community that a childless couple " wants a child " . Often it means adopting one outside official procedures .  This is understandable because for some couples , waiting for the official adoption documentation after two years of trudging through paperwork , interviews , and being monitored by the Welfare Department can be agonising .  Specifics of a child include their gender , weight , health and sometimes skin colour .  For instance , a boy fetches a higher price of between RM12,000 and RM40,000 , while a girl is priced no more than RM25,000 .  The booking fee can be from RM5,000 to RM7,000 .  Previously , a sex worker found to be pregnant would would be sent to the abortion clinic .  " Now the syndicates send her which a doctor would provide a letter furnishing a different identity complementing the new parents , " Fernandez said .  The document is then sent to the National Registration Department , after which a birth certificate is issued .  Fernandez said it is difficult to obtain hard evidence that an exchange has been made .  However , she applauds the government for making the adoption process simpler with the Adoption Act amendments , allowing prospective couples to bring home their adopted child immediately instead of having to wait for the completion of the entire process before being allowed to do so .  " ( Nonetheless ) , there 's a belief among some Malaysians that it is better to adopt the child as an infant because they would then be able to shape the infant 's ' mentality ' , even their physical state , in a safe environment .  " This is as opposed to the other countries , where it 's considered acceptable to adopt an older child , " she said .
