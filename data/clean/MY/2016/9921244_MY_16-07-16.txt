<h> Education <h> Taking innovations to the market <p> LOCAL innovators are stepping up their game to come up with unique ways to cut costs , boost utilisation of local raw material and improve living standards for Malaysians . <p> Universiti Putra Malaysia 's ( UPM ) recent Innovation Open Day ( IOD ) , showcased a number of promising inventions from its Faculty of Design and Architecture , which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year . <p> The university 's Innovation Promotion and Marketing Division deputy director Dr Mohamad Fakri Zaky Ja'afar said the products were created from ideas and concepts of the faculty 's lecturers . <p> He added that the objective of the event ( IOD ) was not only to showcase the inventions , but also an opportunity to connect with the relevant industries . <p> " This is one of the institution 's efforts to expand its network with industries . Our aim is to find commercial value for the inventions " he said . <p> Dr Mohamad Fakri added that the inventions which are patented under the institution , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ' products ' recognised both locally and globally . Many of our innovations are of high standards and have the potential to appeal to industries and the masses . <p> For better posture : Nik Aizan says that the chair his team designed will prevent pupils from slouching . Inset : Both the table and chair can be disassembled after use and placed into the box . <p> " We intend to promote these new inventions through advertisements , networking with relevant industries , and at local and international exhibitions . " <p> " UPM 's previous innovations have brought about positive outcomes as there are companies which are already in the midst of marketing our inventions , <p> " There have even been talks with Japanese companies . They are interested in a number of new products that were demonstrated and displayed at the recent exhibition , " he said . <p> Interested parties are also encouraged to contact UPM 's Putra Science Park , which is the institution 's in-house commercialisation centre that protects the intellectual property of the varsity 's innovators and inventions , he added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured 13 inventions ranging from useful and simple creations like the Froggy Lamp , to more complex ones such as the Independent Sewerage Treatment Plant for Decentralised Water Residences and more . <p> Building matters <p> Developed with the purpose of translating a conventional training curriculum into an interesting and serious training application , the IBS Foreman is in fact , a virtual reality learning application . Meant for students in the architecture or construction field , it allows for better absorption of knowledge . <p> Dr Golnar Kiani , one of the co-researchers on the project , said that the IBS Foreman had up to 14 design principles . <p> It is to ensure students using the game application retain their interest towards the subject , and are exposed to conditions of the actual industry . <p> " Instead of forcing students to sit in classes for long periods of time and visiting construction sites where hazards are aplenty , they can just use virtual reality to learn all they need to about the field , " she said , adding that students have more fun learning in a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's checklist ensures that the environmental , social and economic aspects are taken into consideration when buildings are constructed . <p> She pointed out that the basic concept of the IBS Foreman is to apply the game factors , tools and context to real and actual activities that are carried out in the construction industry . <p> With the IBS Foreman , students will get their avatar to work in a simulated construction site . They will have to construct a building from scratch based on proper building procedures . <p> " If they fail to do so , they have to repeat the steps correctly within a limited time frame . Only then can they move on to the next stage , " she said . <p> " Students will need to pass the test with flying colours at the end of the game . <p> " They will be evaluated and graded based on their results from the IBS Foreman , " said Dr Kiani , pointing out that it is not " just a game " . <p> Using this game application brings a string of benefits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to Dr Kiani , it is an interesting and fun learning concept which improves accuracy on construction knowledge , improves safety , and helps retain student 's knowledge of the field . <p> " Students have found it much more interesting than actual work , and are able to retain quite a lot of what they 've learnt from the game , " she added . <p> Collecting data <p> With the use of the e-Site Inventory mobile application , built environment professionals and students alike now have a platform to accurately collect information from project sites . <p> Project leader Mohd Johari Mohd Yusof said the mobile application was developed for built environment professionals to conduct site surveying and inventory . It also helps to measure an area , capture images , take notes , do rough sketches of information and ideas . <p> Handy programme : Mohd Johari showing off the application which can gauge and measure a project site with speed . <p> " This all-in-one tool collects data accurately , and is user-friendly and intuitive . It also has high potential to be marketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohd Johari said that his team had come up with the idea following numerous complaints from students and colleagues over the numerous items they had to carry . <p> " Built environment professionals need to take several tools and gadgets to measure an area and collect data whenever they visit a project site . <p> " Sometimes the manual calculations may not be accurate which is why the mobile application is handy . <p> " It will do the work for them while monitoring data and assigning follow-up tasks to colleagues . " <p> He added that the usage of the mobile application also ensures that students are actually on site to carry out their assignments or tasks . <p> Furniture for school kids <p> " There have been cases where students download the site information from the web and pass it off as their own . So , to get the actual axis ( measurements ) , they have to be at the site , " he explained . <p> Mohd Johari added that students who tested the application earlier felt that it took less time . This allowed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be used by social surveyors , design consultants and other professions for work-related tasks , " he said . <p> " We now plan to make a new and improved version of the application . It will be more comprehensive yet applicable to other tasks " . <p> Goodbye to creaky chairs and desks as lecturer Nik Aizan Nik Abdullah and his team have come up with ergonomically-designed furniture for schoolchildren . <p> Made with locally produced rubber wood that has undergone the laminated veneer lumber ( LVL ) process , the chairs and tables feature flexible joining systems which makes them more durable than the existing school furniture . <p> Nik Aizan said that the furniture in government schools use British standards which may not be suitable for Malaysian children who are smaller in size . <p> " The design of the chair helps children to sit better , while the more flexible joining systems enable the furniture to endure rocking and other movements of pupils . " <p> He pointed out that the existing furniture in schools are more prone to damage because many pupils tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enabling pupils to have proper posture , there is hardly any cost involved in the upkeep of the furniture . <p> " The tables and chairs can be easily assembled and disassembled and kept away in slim boxes that do n't take up much space , " he said . <p> Complete checklist <p> As more natural disasters occur , it is now vital to have a " sustainable " building to live or work in . <p> It is a comprehensive framework created by Dr Zalina , its sole inventor . <p> She said the framework incorporates the environmental , social and economic aspects -- factors that must be taken into consideration when high-rise buildings are constructed . <p> The framework targets buildings mainly in developing countries such as Malaysia and Thailand . <p> She added that MyOBSA is like a checklist that determines the safety and condition of a building . <p> " The framework also considers local building sector requirements and expectations . <p> " It also includes national and international research findings , " she said , adding that the assessment covers all three components of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dr Zalina said her product brings environmental , social and economic benefits .
