Paralympian Hannah Cockroft Accuses Sportswear Giants Of ...

Hannah Cockroft has accused the world 's two leading sportswear brands of discrimination after claiming the reason she does not have a kit sponsor is because she does not wear shoes during her wheelchair races .  Cockroft , who is expected to be one of the stars of the Paralympic Games in Rio after winning two golds at London 2012 and three in last year 's world championships , is the dominant figure in her sport but said Adidas and Nike have cited her inability to use their footwear in competition as a justification for not sponsoring her . The 24-year-old , who has cerebral palsy , has been angered by a situation she feels illustrates how disabled athletes are still fighting for greater recognition .  " The real reason ? " the ParalympicsGB athlete said . " I have been told it 's because I do n't wear shoes when I compete . What do I do with that ? I wear a shirt , I wear trousers , I wear shoes on the podium when I 'm collecting a gold medal . But 's not enough . I 've been told this by Nike , Adidas , all the big brands . I told them it was discrimination . It is discrimination .  " Some child somewhere watches every single one of us and is inspired to come into sport . They watch us and think : ' If they 're wearing that top , that 's what I 'm going to wear because if that 's what makes them go faster that 's what will make me go faster . ' That is the mindset . If able-bodied children think that when they look at Jess Ennis , then I 'm pretty sure disabled children must think like that when they look at me . It 's frustrating . You work as hard as you can . You kind of wonder what more can I win to make you want to sponsor me . "  Nike defended its record in disability sport by pointing out it sponsors another British wheelchair racer who does not compete in its footwear , David Weir , and also has deals with ParalympicsGB 's Aled Davies , the USA 's Tatyana McFadden , Lex Gillette , April Holmes , Scout Bassett , Blake Leeper and Alana Nichols , and Brazil 's Ver ? nica Hip ? lito and Fernando Fernandes . The American sportswear giant designed the kit worn by Great British athletes at last year 's IPC world championships in Doha .  " Nike has a long history of working with Olympians and Paralympians who do not compete in Nike footwear , from Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Simone Biles , to six-times gold medal-winning Paralympian David Weir , " a Nike spokesperson said . " Nike works with multiple Paralympic athletes through individual athlete relationships or through partnerships with federations such as USA and Brazil . Nike also supports aspiring Paralympic athletes through sponsorship of the British Athletics futures programme . "  Adidas also rejected Cockroft 's claims , pointing out it has designed ParalympicsGB 's kit for the Games . " As a sports brand we have partnerships with teams , including ParalympicsGB , and individuals across both apparel and footwear , " a spokesperson said . " Whilst we will not discuss number of athletes who do n't wear footwear to compete . "  Yet while Cockroft , who is expected to triumph in the 100m , 400m and 800m T34 events in Rio , has worn Adidas and Nike kit while representing Great Britain in international tournaments , she does not have a kit deal with any company on an individual basis . That leaves her stretched in individual tournaments and during training sessions .  Cockroft has had talks about kit sponsorship in the past but it is understood the companies ' offers have fallen below expectations . She has lost one race in the past four years and there is a belief she deserves a deal befitting an elite athlete . While she hopes success in Rio will enhance her appeal , she finds the situation disheartening .  " It 's frustrating because it 's not my fault that I do n't wear shoes , " she said . " I still get on the track and I still go fast . It should n't really matter what 's on my feet when I 'm doing that . sponsor , that 's when you 've made it . On Twitter everyone is either a Nike athlete or an Adidas athlete . I feel like if someone wants to have you as their athlete and wear their kit for every training session and every competition , that 's when you are a true elite athlete .  " Someone is proud of what you 're doing . It 's something as silly as I do n't use my feet for my events . That ca n't be the be -- all and end -- all . I wear shoes in everyday life . I 'll wear your socks if it 's important what 's on my feet . You just have to fight for it . We 've fought for it for the last four years and have got nowhere .  " It 's back to politics , back to people not seeing us as the elite athletes that we are . It is a little bit of perception . I 'm on a billboard now so I 'm doing something right . I wish I knew the answers ourselves in people 's faces a bit more now , showing them every year that the whole team is breaking world records , getting faster , getting stronger . It 's about making people notice that now . "
