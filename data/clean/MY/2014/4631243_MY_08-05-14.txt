<h> ROS Lboard <h> US takes Indonesia to WTO over import rules <p> May 9 , 2014 <p> WASHINGTON : The United States said today it was taking Indonesia back to the WTO to loosen its rules on the import of agricultural products , saying that reforms have been insufficient . <p> The United States , joined by fellow agricultural exporter New Zealand , said that they were seeking consultations under the World Trade Organisation . If talks fail , the two Western nations could ask for the Geneva-based body to set up a panel to settle the dispute . <p> The United States in early 2013 also held WTO consultations with Indonesia over its " opaque and complex " rules on imports . In response , Indonesia streamlined its import licensing process and removed a number of items from regulation including garlic , chili powder and cabbage . <p> " Unfortunately , the revised system still appears to breach WTO rules and restrict US agricultural exports , " US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement as he announced the new WTO move . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its import licensing system into compliance with WTO rules so that US farmers , ranchers , and businesses are able to have the access to Indonesia 's market that we negotiated in the WTO , " he said . <p> The United States said it was concerned about restrictions on its exports of fruits , vegetables , flowers , beef , poultry and other products to Indonesia , the world 's fourth most populous nation . <p> The action comes ahead of Indonesia 's presidential elections in July in which one issue facing candidates is economic policies seen by foreign investors as nationalist . <p> Indonesia generally has friendly relations with the United States , which has also launched WTO action against India in the midst of national elections . <p> -- AFP <h> Comments <p> Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story .
