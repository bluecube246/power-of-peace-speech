fiat chrysler going for global push  detroit : newly merged fiat chrysler automobiles laid out aggressive plans yesterday , including a revitalisation of the alfa romeo sports-car line and the doubling of jeep sales , mainly in china .  chief executive sergio marchionne said the italian-american carmaker aims to build sales not only in the united states but in other markets as it seeks to rival general motors and volkswagen .  " the history of the automobile industry is littered with alliances that have failed , " marchionne told investors , suppliers and reporters at chrysler headquarters in detroit , newly relabelled fiat chrysler .  " in the past five years , fiat and chrysler have learned to work together and trust each other , " he said .  this has led to a sharing of technical knowledge and market savvy , which is turning the company into a true global automaker , he said .  " in a flat world , you can not be secure in your own market unless you can compete on a global basis , " in january , though the formal corporate union , combining their accounts , will not be completed until mid-2014 . after that the company will list its shares on the new york stock exchange .  yesterday , fiat group released its earnings for the first quarter -- with chrysler still a minority-held subsidiary -- that saw it falling to a loss of 319 million euros ( us$444 million ) mainly on costs associated with its takeover of chrysler .  vehicle shipments were up 9.1% from the year-earlier quarter to 1.1 million units , and net revenues gained 12.3% to 22.1 billion euros .  with the european market in poor shape , and the us market booming , chrysler 's sales and profits have been crucial to its italian parent .  marchionne said the company is determined to build more presence in the world 's strongest markets , including the united states and china , over the next five years .  the combined company wants to increase its market share in the us-canada-mexico market to 15% from 11.5% , helped by an expanded product line .  effort , mike manley , head of the jeep brand , told investors .  jeeps are now built only in the us but the firm expects sales to grow by 20% per year over the next five years , doubling this year 's expected one million units by 2018 , manley said .  in the next five years jeep will begin building cars in brazil , italy , india and china .  " jeep is one of the fastest-growing imported brands in china and this is our largest jeep market outside the us , " manley said .  a separate push is in store for alfa romeo , which has sagged behind rival luxury sports cars in europe and has been virtually absent in the united states while mercedes benz , audi and bmw have enjoyed booming sales .  harald wester , the fiat executive in charge of alfa romeo , said the brand has earned much glory on the race track but has never had much financial success .  " it neglected its roots , " noted wester , adding alfa romeo 's commercial brand so appealing when it went racing .  but a presentation showed a challenging effort to grow alfa romeo sales from 74,000 cars in 2013 to 400,000 in 2018 , introducing eight new models over that time .  " our german competitors have enjoyed phenomenal success , " noted wester . alfa romeo will double its engineering staff to 600 by the end of next year and the goal is to deliver the best rear-wheel-drive automobile architecture in the world , he said .  " our future products will be equipped with cutting-edge powertrains , " he added .  keeping ferrari limited  at the same time , the company will resist bowing to surging demand for its ferrari supercars , limiting production to the current 7,000 a year level at least through 2018 to ensure the brand 's image is protected .  demand in emerging markets like china is strong enough for a 10,000 unit annual output , but that is more than ferrari wants to produce .  " we want to keep production capped to preserve the brand 's uniqueness , while continuing in mature ones , " said marchionne .  marchionne said ferrari will launch a new model every year , with a four-year life cycle for each new model .  it will launch special limited series targeting the wealthiest customers and broaden its " personalization " of key models to boost ferrari 's profit margins .  " that 's very good business for us , " he said .  -- afp  comments  readers are required to have a valid facebook account to comment on this story . we welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate . we want our readers to be responsible while commenting and to consider how their views could be received by others . please be polite and do not use swear words or crude or sexual language or defamatory words . fmt also holds the right to remove comments that violate the letter or spirit of the general commenting rules .  the views expressed in the contents are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of fmt.
