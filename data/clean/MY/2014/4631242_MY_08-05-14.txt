<h> Judge me not for the heels I wear <p> KUALA LUMPUR : I was in the little girl 's room yesterday at the office when a woman who works at the same building started to chat me up on my pregnancy . <p> She said , " Is this your first pregnancy ? How far along are you ? " <p> And I explained , no this is my third and I am in my 28th week . <p> She was shocked and say , " Oh I thought this is your first and that my friends and I saw you yesterday at the cafeteria and we were discussing on how you are risking your baby 's safety with those heels you are wearing . You should n't you know . Stay with your flat shoes .. why are you even wearing those ? You should know better ... " <p> I was washing my hands then , hiding the reaction on my face and asked her , " Really ? How many kids do you have ? " <p> She said , " none " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving her previous questions unanswered . <p> So , why am I even wearing heels when I am pregnant ? ( you may ask ) <p> Humans are creatures of habits right ? I have been wearing heels for the past 17 years and I am unlike other women who can wear flat shoes to work . I feel really uncomfortable and I ca n't walk properly should I wear those heel-less pumps . I need my ' elevation ' . <p> Of course , I know wearing heels can cause back pain , achy joints and even more for a pregnant woman whose body goes all weird with hormonal imbalance etc . But believe me , I am one of those women who are blessed with easy-peasy pregnancy , and I do n't have any of those aside from the occasional leg cramps at night and 2 day morning sickness . Hence , I am undeserving for public scrutiny . <p> But the question here ( for me at least who is going through this hormonal imbalance ) , do I deserve being judged as a lesser mother just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't run at work that I need to put on my running shoes or sneakers . The only walking I do is the usual -- to caf ? , toilets and the occasional location shoot . So why am I the subject of scrutiny by other women just because I am comfortable in the shoes I am in ? <p> I know that at this stage , my pregnancy has altered my center of gravity but believe me , I know what I am doing . My heels are not those towering slim stilettos like Victoria Beckham 's - for which she paid the price of a slip disc due to wearing stilettos during her later stage of her fourth pregnancy . I will certainly not pose that kind of danger to any of my precious babies . <p> I am just taken aback by the fact that there are professional women out there who still lack the skills of communicating , especially to another humans of the same gender and that there are professional women out there who still think and play the role of gossip girls in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest job I have ever have to do and at the same time , the most enjoyable and fulfilling . And having to have a person who has not encountered motherhood to ' preach ' to me on the best interest of my unborn child and relate it to my favourite things on earth which are shoes ? - I find it to be offensive . <p> There are more than one ways to strike a conversation with a stranger , and criticising a pregnant woman 's choice in shoes is certainly not one of the better ways . <p> Kate Middleton , Kim Kardashian , Victoria Beckham ( just to name a few ) were scrutinised for wearing heels during their pregnancy and now I am on that list , I am totally empathic with them . <p> So , no , I am not going to chuck my heels away . I am just fine balancing work and home in my heels and if anybody has a problem with that ... well , they should know better than to get in a row with a pregnant woman .
