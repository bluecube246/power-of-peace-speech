Menkes ' departure comes four months after the 125-year-old Paris-based IHT changed its name to the International New York Times , marking the end of a chapter in newspaper history .  Menkes , who is British , continued in her role as Style Editor after the name change in October 2013 and management stressed at the time that the re-branding would not affect the content of the newspaper .  In a statement on its websites , Vogue said the 70-year-old Menkes would join parent company Conde Nast as International Vogue Editor .  Menkes was " hugely influential " into the fashion industry to the job , said Jonathan Newhouse , Conde Nast International chief executive .  Menkes , who will write for all the international Vogue websites , added in the statement that after " 25 years at the International Herald Tribune " it was the " perfect time to embrace a new challenge in the digital age " .  Founded by publisher Gordon Bennett , the IHT began life as the European edition of his New York Herald newspaper catering for American expats in Paris .  It was known as the New York Herald Tribune in 1960 when actress Jean Seberg appeared in Jean-Luc Godard 's film " Breathless " selling copies on the Champs-Elysees. -- AFP
