2016 should be about fighting corruption -- walter sandosam  this year has been a bumpy ride both on the political and economic fronts . as a nation we should reflect and look ahead positively .  noble intentions are many . these need working on daily and in perpetuity as nothing good evolves from negativity and mutual distrust .  of late , there has been growing intolerance of our diversity on both racial and religious grounds .  on the economic front , the prices of our main export commodities have fallen , affecting the ringgit and cost of living .  if that is not enough , national security is being threatened by extremism and radicalism from external elements .  casting aspersions on any single segment of the population based on religious , political , economic or social leanings do not help in fostering unity .  they , in fact , create mistrust and more headaches for the authorities .  perceived credibility deficits and truth deficits are affecting the psyche of the nation . when trust is low , everyone acts  we as members of civil society have a role to play in building a long-term culture of integrity and good governance .  these are the building blocks of trust . each member of the community has to take responsibility in the building of trust .  high levels of ethics , governance and integrity are components that need to be emphasised to ensure a corrupt-free country . corruption is a scourge which has to be overcome or it will consume us . while greed is insatiable , corruption , on the other hand , is a mindset .  without integrity , corruption thrives . this is the reality , to which some are oblivious .  to build trust , we must strive to address the divisions that exist in society , and which seem to be growing wider over time .  these include not only the familiar ethnic , religious and territorial divisions but also divisions in social class and ideology .  one can not build a high-trust society if we continue to be polarised in so many ways . it can not happen if and groupings .  all institutions of governance have a role to play and they must be seen to be playing it effectively in the in interests of the wider public and not entrenched self-serving pressure groups .  public perception must not be compromised .  as a nation , we have to stand together and be sure of ourselves and not be swayed by negative emotions , especially those which touch on racial and religious diversity . religious values have to be inculcated continuously at all levels  going into 2016 , we should celebrate our differences . do not play up non-existent threats and be afraid of shadows .  the law is there to protect and the police should act fairly and firmly based on the rule of law .  we should focus our efforts on initiatives to building a more harmonious and mature malaysia , which is able to take all challenges in its stride .  good governance and strong positive values related to ethics , morality and integrity are the keys to national development . we have to internalise these values to be it is a monumental task which all should take responsibility for and be accountable . it must be our new year resolution for 2016. -- december 31 , 2015 .  * walter sandosam reads the malaysian insider .  * this is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of the malaysian insider .  please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website . we encourage commenters to use their real names as their username . as comments are moderated , they may not appear immediately or even on the same day you posted them . we also reserve the right to delete off-topic comments
