double joy to indonesia -- the jakarta post  it 's a double celebration in indonesia this week with the nation marking the birth of prophet muhammad on thursday and christmas , the birth of jesus christ , on friday .  both are national holidays to let muslims and christians , the two largest religious communities in indonesia , mark the events with excitement as well as solemnity .  the two religions may have a long history of bloody rivalries -- sometimes inevitable when dealing with claims of truth -- but christians and muslims have had their share of peaceful coexistence as well . look no further than indonesia for evidence .  indonesia may be the country with the largest muslim population in the world , but its religious minorities , particularly christians though also hindus , that account for about 14% of its 250 million people , live in pockets of the archipelago where sometimes they are the dominant religion . the concept of majority-minority religions is therefore irrelevant in indonesia .  what is important is that their presence in the country nation , including during the independence struggle in the 1940s and throughout the nation 's birth and development since then , are well recognised .  with the exception of a few religious conflicts during the 70 years of indonesia 's independence , we can take pride in indonesia 's record of interfaith relations -- the different religious communities have by and large lived peacefully side by side .  this is a feat many indonesians may take for granted , but it is widely admired by other countries where tension , rivalry and conflict between religious communities seem to be the norm .  we have to thank indonesia 's founders for their foresight in laying down the foundations needed for this large and diverse nation to live in peace .  the 1945 constitution guarantees freedom of religion , and the first of the five tenets of the state ideology pancasila is " belief in one god " .  we may be praying differently and have different approaches to truth , but we all worship the same deity . for better or for worse , indonesians of all big nation .  so , what better way of celebrating the birth of prophet muhammad and jesus christ , who muslims also revere as one of their prophets , in the best of indonesian traditions : marking them with joy and mutual respect , tolerance and moderation -- the hallmarks of all peace-loving nations . -- the jakarta post , december 25 , 2015 .  * this is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of the malaysian insider .  please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website . we encourage commenters to use their real names as their username . as comments are moderated , they may not appear immediately or even on the same day you posted them . we also reserve the right to delete off-topic comments
