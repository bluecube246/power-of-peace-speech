" ten years , 100 years , 1,000 years , we will stay faithful to you " declare the billboards going up around beirut as the country prepares to mark the february 14 , 2005 murder of hariri .  in the months that followed , a popular movement that accused damascus of his killing forced syrian troops out of lebanon after a 30-year presence .  many in the country saw the syrian withdrawal as a chance for lebanon to shake off the influence of its larger neighbour and its perpetual status as a pawn in wider regional struggles . cause for hope , with syria 's civil war deepening divisions that emerged after hariri 's death .  lebanon is fractured between hezbollah-led supporters of president bashar al-assad and his regional ally iran , and a camp that backs the syrian uprising and is allied with saudi arabia and the united states .  hariri had close links to sunni-ruled saudi arabia , which vies with shiite iran for influence in the middle east .  after the assassination " lebanon entered the orbit of damascus , tehran and hezbollah , and this axis continues to prevail , " said daoud al-sayegh , a former advisor to hariri .  the division is at the root of ongoing instability , including a string of bomb attacks that have targeted both sides .  it has also contributed to a political stalemate that has left the country without a president for eight months , the longest such vacuum since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war .  on the country 's borders , the under-equipped lebanese army is struggling to keep jihadists from syria at bay , and in the .  " the country has collapsed since hariri 's assassination , " said a resident of beirut 's ain al-mreisse district , where hariri and 22 others were killed by a suicide bomber in a car .  far from bringing together the country and freeing it of syrian influence , analysts say the decade since hariri 's death has served to cement the preeminence of the shiite movement hezbollah , a key ally of damascus .  " this murder has had the effect of a coup d'etat , " said hilal khashan , political science professor at the american university in beirut .  hariri " represented the saudi project , and with him gone , it 's the iranian project that has taken over . "  syria never forgave him  khashan said hariri had sought to " transform the country into a symbol of moderation and a safeguard against extremism . "  " he was assassinated before he could do that , " he said .  nicknamed " mr lebanon , " hariri was known for his patience and " represented a moderate after his murder , extremist sunnis began to appear " in lebanon , he said .  hariri served as prime minister under syrian influence from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2004 .  he was vehemently opposed to damascus 's imposed extension of president emile lahoud 's term in 2004 , but was coerced into voting for it .  angered by hariri 's opposition , syria 's assad reportedly threatened to " destroy lebanon on top of his head . "  with the support of riyadh and his close friend french former president jacques chirac , hariri backed a un security council resolution calling on foreign troops to leave lebanon .  " the syrians never forgave him , " khashan said .  " hariri put lebanon on the international map , and that angered them , " added former advisor sayegh .  in a first for lebanon , the frequent scene of political assassinations and intrigue , hariri 's murder is being prosecuted before the special tribunal for lebanon at the hague .  the court has indicted five hezbollah members for them over , accusing the tribunal of being an " israeli-american tool " .  in the months after hariri 's assassination , the murder was seen as a sort of " founding event for the unity of the country , " according to fares souaid , a member of the movement that emerged against the syrian regime after the ex-premier 's murder .  but " 10 years later , we are seeing the weakening of the state and communities returning back behind their barricades . "  several events will be held in beirut to mark the anniversary including a gathering at the site of the attack , where a flame will be lit in his honour , and a prayer at his tomb .  hariri was often criticised for marrying politics and business and running up huge debts in his reconstruction projects .  but he also attracted investors , many of whom now shy away from lebanon because of the violence , instability and spillover from the syrian war that followed his death .  " the lebanese are unable to free themselves from a situation " said sayegh.
