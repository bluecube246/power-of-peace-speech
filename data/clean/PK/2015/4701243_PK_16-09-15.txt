PHOTO COURTESY : THE MALAYSIAN INSIDER <p> KUALA LUMPUR : Thousands of ruling-party supporters marched through Malaysia 's capital on Wednesday to support the embattled government and assert the political dominance of the Malay majority , in a demonstration whose racial overtones have sparked concern . <p> The demonstration was organised by figures in the ruling United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) in response to massive street rallies last month calling for Prime Minister Najib Razak 's resignation over a financial scandal . <p> The vast majority of those marching in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday were young ethnic Malay men wearing UMNO red , with some carrying banners and shouting slogans such as " Long live the Malays . " <p> " I came to defend Malay rights , " said Aswad Shaari , 25 , who was among large numbers of Malays bussed in by organisers from the countryside . <p> UMNO has controlled multi-ethnic Malaysia for 58 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia also has sizeable ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities . <p> The party has increasingly resorted to racial rhetoric to shore up Malay Muslim support , raising ethnic tensions . <p> The demonstrators had planned to march through commercial and tourist districts dominated by ethnic Chinese-run businesses . Chinese make up about a quarter of Malaysia 's population . <p> But authorities have said they would be diverted from those areas to avoid trouble . <p> Hundreds of police were deployed throughout central Kuala Lumpur , and some Chinese commercial areas were sealed off , leaving bemused tourists to wander among the heavy security and shuttered shops . <p> A rally was scheduled at a central park area later . Organisers have vowed the demonstration would be peaceful . <p> But the rally has been criticised by both ruling-party and opposition figures as racially provocative in a country where deadly sectarian riots in 1969 are still regularly cited as a cautionary tale . <p> Najib , who was already under fire over huge sums of money missing from a state firm he launched , has been deeply tarnished by the revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deposits into his personal bank accounts . <p> His government has called them " political donations " from Middle Eastern sources but has refused to give details . <p> Najib subsequently sacked his attorney general and made other personnel moves critics say were intended to hamper criminal investigations .
