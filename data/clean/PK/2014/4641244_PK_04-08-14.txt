South Africa detains one of Britain 's " most wanted fugitives "  JOHANNESBURG : A South African court on Monday remanded convicted British drug trafficker and fraudster Martin Evans , a phoney ostrich farmer who was on the run for three years before his arrest in Johannesburg at the weekend .  Evans , named by British police in 2012 as one of their " most wanted fugitives " , appeared in a Johannesburg court on Monday but his extradition hearing was postponed until Aug. 11 because he did not have proper legal representation .  The 52-year-old from Swansea was jailed in Britain for 21 years in 2006 for conspiracy to supply cocaine and fraudulent trading , but he escaped in 2011 when he failed to return to prison after being released on a five-day license .  Evans , a former Young Businessman of the Year for Wales , swindled more than 100 investors , many newly-retired pensioners , out of around 900,000 pounds ( $1.5 million ) by promising huge returns from a spurious ostrich-breeding business .  South African police arrested Evans a joint operation with Interpol and British security agencies .  " This arrest shows the NCA and its partners will pursue fugitives wherever they are in the world , " said Hank Cole , Head of International Operations at Britain 's National Crime Agency .  " They can run but they ca n't hide . " ( $1 = 0.59 British Pounds ) - Reuters
