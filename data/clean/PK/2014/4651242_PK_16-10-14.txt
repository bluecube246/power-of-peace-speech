new delhi- india has told the top chinese leadership many times that jammu &amp; kashmir and arunachal pradesh are its " integral and inalienable parts " , adding that the neighbor claims the northeastern state while being in illegal occupation of large tracts of land in kashmir .  " china claims approx 90,000 square kilometers of indian territory in arunachal . indian territory under the occupation of china in j&amp;k is approx 38,000 sq km . in addition , under the so-called china-pakistan ' boundary agreement ' signed between china and pakistan on march 2 , 1963 , pakistan illegally ceded 5180 sq km of indian territory in pakistan-occupied kashmir to china , " foreign minister sushma swaraj has said .  the assertion came in a written response to congress mp mullapally ramchandran who had raised in lok sabha the issue of " distribution of controversial maps by china to its military " . he had brought to the notice of parliament that china had given maps to its army that showed parts of india as its own .  swaraj further added , " parts of india has been clearly conveyed to the chinese side on several occasions , including at the highest level . "  india considers aksai chin as part of its ladakh district in jammu &amp; kashmir but it is under chinese control . in arunachal , china claims most of the state , which is under indian control . the reply comes after the face-off between india and china in chumar in j&amp;k where chinese soldiers came and pitched tents in the indian territory . that it came during the visit of chinese president xi jinping complicated the issue and led to vociferous protests from the indian side .
