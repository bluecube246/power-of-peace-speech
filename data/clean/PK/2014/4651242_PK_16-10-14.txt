<p> NEW DELHI- India has told the top Chinese leadership many times that Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh are its " integral and inalienable parts " , adding that the neighbor claims the northeastern state while being in illegal occupation of large tracts of land in Kashmir . <p> " China claims approx 90,000 square kilometers of Indian territory in Arunachal . Indian Territory under the occupation of China in J&amp;K is approx 38,000 sq km . In addition , under the so-called China-Pakistan ' boundary agreement ' signed between China and Pakistan on March 2 , 1963 , Pakistan illegally ceded 5180 sq km of Indian territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China , " foreign minister Sushma Swaraj has said . <p> The assertion came in a written response to Congress MP Mullapally Ramchandran who had raised in Lok Sabha the issue of " distribution of controversial maps by China to its military " . He had brought to the notice of Parliament that China had given maps to its army that showed parts of India as its own . <p> Swaraj further added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of India has been clearly conveyed to the Chinese side on several occasions , including at the highest level . " <p> India considers Aksai Chin as part of its Ladakh district in Jammu &amp; Kashmir but it is under Chinese control . In Arunachal , China claims most of the state , which is under Indian control . The reply comes after the face-off between India and China in Chumar in J&amp;K where Chinese soldiers came and pitched tents in the Indian Territory . That it came during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping complicated the issue and led to vociferous protests from the Indian side .
