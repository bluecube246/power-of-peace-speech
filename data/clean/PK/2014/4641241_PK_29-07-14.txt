<p> Talking to media at Karachi airport , Barrister Farogh Naseem said the case formed against the MQM chief had no potential . He further mentioned that neither MQM nor Altaf Hussain had pleaded for an extension in bail , rather the Scotland Yard itself extended the bail by five months . <p> Naseem stated this clearly shows that MQM and its chief stand with the truth and righteousness , no matter how difficult the circumstances may be . <p> Earlier , the London Metropolitan Police had extended the bail granted to Altaf Hussain till December , this year , in connection to the money laundering case against him . <p> The MQM chief was initially granted bail till July 30 and he had to appear for a police interview on July 31 ; however the decision came almost a day before his due appearance .
