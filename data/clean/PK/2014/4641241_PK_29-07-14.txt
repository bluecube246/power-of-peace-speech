talking to media at karachi airport , barrister farogh naseem said the case formed against the mqm chief had no potential . he further mentioned that neither mqm nor altaf hussain had pleaded for an extension in bail , rather the scotland yard itself extended the bail by five months .  naseem stated this clearly shows that mqm and its chief stand with the truth and righteousness , no matter how difficult the circumstances may be .  earlier , the london metropolitan police had extended the bail granted to altaf hussain till december , this year , in connection to the money laundering case against him .  the mqm chief was initially granted bail till july 30 and he had to appear for a police interview on july 31 ; however the decision came almost a day before his due appearance .
