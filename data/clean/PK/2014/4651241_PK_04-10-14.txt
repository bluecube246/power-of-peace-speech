email  dera : the pakistani taliban declared allegiance to islamic state on saturday and ordered militants across the region to help the middle eastern jihadist group in its campaign to set up a global islamic caliphate .  islamic state , which controls swathes of land in syria and iraq , has been making inroads into south asia , which has traditionally been dominated by local taliban insurgencies against both the pakistan and afghanistan governments .  the announcement comes after a september move by al qaeda chief , ayman al-zawahri , to name former taliban commander asim umar as the " emir " of a new south asia branch of the network that masterminded the 2001 attacks on the united states .  although there is little evidence of a firm alliance yet between is and al qaeda-linked taliban commanders , is activists have been spotted recently in peshawar distributing pamphlets praising the group .  is flags have also been seen at street rallies in indian-administered kashmir . the trend has been of growing concern to global powers struggling to keep up with the message marking the muslim holy festival of eid al-adha , the tehreek-i-taliban pakistan ( ttp ) said they fully supported is goals .  " oh our brothers , we are proud of you in your victories . we are with you in your happiness and your sorrow , " ttp spokesman shahidullah shahid said in a statement sent to reuters by email from an unknown location .  " in these troubled days , we call for your patience and stability , especially now that all your enemies are united against you . please put all your rivalries behind you ... all muslims in the world have great expectations of you ... we are with you , we will provide you with mujahideen ( fighters ) and with every possible support . "  the statement , released in urdu , pashto and arabic , was sent after islamic state militants beheaded british aid worker alan henning in a video posted on friday , triggering condemnation by the british and us governments .  it also came despite recent speculation that the taliban leadership , whose goal is to topple actually wary of is , which is driven by different ambitions that have little to do with south asia .  the pakistani taliban , funded by local as well as foreign charity donations from wealthy supporters in the gulf and elsewhere , operate separately from the afghan insurgents of the same name , but are loosely aligned with them .  there are concerns about further turmoil in the region as most us-led foreign troops withdraw from afghanistan this year , with groups like the haqqani network likely to exploit the security vacuum to strengthen their hold on afghan regions .  the haqqani network , despite being based in pakistan , is narrowly focused on its insurgency in afghanistan and has not commented on is-related developments .  the ttp has been beset by bitter internal rivalries over the past year , with the influential mehsud tribal faction of the group refusing to accept the authority of mullah fazlullah , who came to power in late 2013 .  is , in an effort to extend its global reach , could exploit these rivalries to its advantage , wading of young unemployed men ready to take up guns and fight for islam .  comments ( 87 ) closed  now this is serious for someone with my name . eliminate them as fast as possible , do n't bother about collateral damage . killing them is essential , if you do n't do it now , you will repent later .  recommend0  sayyar khan  oct 04 , 2014 08:54pm  well they have things in common they all wear shalwar kameez . some how shalwar kameez has become trade mark uniform for all these groups around the world .  recommend0  mohsin  oct 04 , 2014 09:00pm  @ akhand bharat ,  please worry about your own terrorists , such as the genocidal maniac sitting in your highest office right now .  @ pak forces :  after you wipe out the ttp , please consider joining turkey 's ( possible future ) ground operations against is in syria and iraq .  recommend0  kiwi  oct 04 , 2014 09:01pm  not surprising . afterall feathers of the same birds recommend0  kashmiri  oct 04 , 2014 09:03pm  if kashmir problem is solved , will these groups disappear . i wonder . will is and ttp have no more agenda left and will they allow pakistan to be peaceful and march ahead .  recommend0  ash  oct 04 , 2014 09:05pm  these filthy mouths and brains , tell them to leave pakistan and go wherever they want to go .  recommend0  karmat  oct 04 , 2014 09:12pm  will these groups the is and ttp disappear into thin air if kashmir problem is resolved , and are these created due to kashmir issue and will normalcy return if kashmir is solved .  recommend0  arif khan  oct 04 , 2014 09:15pm  i request dawn to please stop printing such stories as this provides opportunity to terrorists to carry out their false and baseless propaganda .  recommend0  bitter but true  oct 04 , 2014 09:16pm  i don , t know as to when these thick headed paid killers will learn that the evil minded people are using  oct 04 , 2014 09:19pm  is this person not a suspected terrorist and what are pakistan fighter jets and operation zarb-i-azb doing , did they not find this guy anywhere even if he is giving interviews to all news channels .  recommend0  usman khan  oct 04 , 2014 09:22pm  is anyone actually surprised ?
