<h> Email <p> DERA : The Pakistani Taliban declared allegiance to Islamic State on Saturday and ordered militants across the region to help the Middle Eastern jihadist group in its campaign to set up a global Islamic caliphate . <p> Islamic State , which controls swathes of land in Syria and Iraq , has been making inroads into South Asia , which has traditionally been dominated by local Taliban insurgencies against both the Pakistan and Afghanistan governments . <p> The announcement comes after a September move by al Qaeda chief , Ayman al-Zawahri , to name former Taliban commander Asim Umar as the " emir " of a new South Asia branch of the network that masterminded the 2001 attacks on the United States . <p> Although there is little evidence of a firm alliance yet between IS and al Qaeda-linked Taliban commanders , IS activists have been spotted recently in Peshawar distributing pamphlets praising the group . <p> IS flags have also been seen at street rallies in Indian-administered Kashmir . The trend has been of growing concern to global powers struggling to keep up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message marking the Muslim holy festival of Eid al-Adha , the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) said they fully supported IS goals . <p> " Oh our brothers , we are proud of you in your victories . We are with you in your happiness and your sorrow , " TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said in a statement sent to Reuters by email from an unknown location . <p> " In these troubled days , we call for your patience and stability , especially now that all your enemies are united against you . Please put all your rivalries behind you ... All Muslims in the world have great expectations of you ... We are with you , we will provide you with Mujahideen ( fighters ) and with every possible support . " <p> The statement , released in Urdu , Pashto and Arabic , was sent after Islamic State militants beheaded British aid worker Alan Henning in a video posted on Friday , triggering condemnation by the British and US governments . <p> It also came despite recent speculation that the Taliban leadership , whose goal is to topple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually wary of IS , which is driven by different ambitions that have little to do with South Asia . <p> The Pakistani Taliban , funded by local as well as foreign charity donations from wealthy supporters in the Gulf and elsewhere , operate separately from the Afghan insurgents of the same name , but are loosely aligned with them . <p> There are concerns about further turmoil in the region as most US-led foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan this year , with groups like the Haqqani network likely to exploit the security vacuum to strengthen their hold on Afghan regions . <p> The Haqqani network , despite being based in Pakistan , is narrowly focused on its insurgency in Afghanistan and has not commented on IS-related developments . <p> The TTP has been beset by bitter internal rivalries over the past year , with the influential Mehsud tribal faction of the group refusing to accept the authority of Mullah Fazlullah , who came to power in late 2013 . <p> IS , in an effort to extend its global reach , could exploit these rivalries to its advantage , wading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young unemployed men ready to take up guns and fight for Islam . <h> Comments ( 87 ) Closed <p> Now this is serious for someone with my name . Eliminate them as fast as possible , do n't bother about collateral damage . Killing them is essential , if you do n't do it now , you will repent later . <p> Recommend0 <p> Sayyar Khan <p> Oct 04 , 2014 08:54pm <p> Well they have things in common they all wear Shalwar Kameez .

So what was achieved other than disruption of so many lives ? There is a cheering crowd for the army 's action but what 's the end point ?
