Email  DERA : The Pakistani Taliban declared allegiance to Islamic State on Saturday and ordered militants across the region to help the Middle Eastern jihadist group in its campaign to set up a global Islamic caliphate .  Islamic State , which controls swathes of land in Syria and Iraq , has been making inroads into South Asia , which has traditionally been dominated by local Taliban insurgencies against both the Pakistan and Afghanistan governments .  The announcement comes after a September move by al Qaeda chief , Ayman al-Zawahri , to name former Taliban commander Asim Umar as the " emir " of a new South Asia branch of the network that masterminded the 2001 attacks on the United States .  Although there is little evidence of a firm alliance yet between IS and al Qaeda-linked Taliban commanders , IS activists have been spotted recently in Peshawar distributing pamphlets praising the group .  IS flags have also been seen at street rallies in Indian-administered Kashmir . The trend has been of growing concern to global powers struggling to keep up with the message marking the Muslim holy festival of Eid al-Adha , the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) said they fully supported IS goals .  " Oh our brothers , we are proud of you in your victories . We are with you in your happiness and your sorrow , " TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said in a statement sent to Reuters by email from an unknown location .  " In these troubled days , we call for your patience and stability , especially now that all your enemies are united against you . Please put all your rivalries behind you ... All Muslims in the world have great expectations of you ... We are with you , we will provide you with Mujahideen ( fighters ) and with every possible support . "  The statement , released in Urdu , Pashto and Arabic , was sent after Islamic State militants beheaded British aid worker Alan Henning in a video posted on Friday , triggering condemnation by the British and US governments .  It also came despite recent speculation that the Taliban leadership , whose goal is to topple actually wary of IS , which is driven by different ambitions that have little to do with South Asia .  The Pakistani Taliban , funded by local as well as foreign charity donations from wealthy supporters in the Gulf and elsewhere , operate separately from the Afghan insurgents of the same name , but are loosely aligned with them .  There are concerns about further turmoil in the region as most US-led foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan this year , with groups like the Haqqani network likely to exploit the security vacuum to strengthen their hold on Afghan regions .  The Haqqani network , despite being based in Pakistan , is narrowly focused on its insurgency in Afghanistan and has not commented on IS-related developments .  The TTP has been beset by bitter internal rivalries over the past year , with the influential Mehsud tribal faction of the group refusing to accept the authority of Mullah Fazlullah , who came to power in late 2013 .  IS , in an effort to extend its global reach , could exploit these rivalries to its advantage , wading of young unemployed men ready to take up guns and fight for Islam .  Comments ( 87 ) Closed  Now this is serious for someone with my name . Eliminate them as fast as possible , do n't bother about collateral damage .

They are the USA , EU and all other white people who nourished them and now Khan Arabs look upon Pakistanis as naukars or as " lower caste muslims " at best . They would be insulted by your claim that they have adopted the Pakistani dress . Trouble is too many Pakistanis also consider arabs to be " upper caste muslims " and are flattered at the delusion ( like you have ) that Arabs adopt any part of Pakistani culture .

They are more like the Khwarijites against whom the Prophet ( S ) warned his followers .  That region was once very much influenced by the Sufis who generally practiced enlightened and very peaceful and universal forms of Islam .  I personally do not see any other remedy than a mass change in direction to the Sufi Tariqahs .  Sadly , the effects of puritanical forms of Islam have become deeper than was the case a few decades ago .  Moreover , there are external influences as well , which the governments have not been able to deal with .  Having said that , I do not see any other remedy than for people to go back to the various forms of Sufi Islam for their cleansing of the heart , so that it reflects the higher consciousness .  I realize it 's not easy , but I see no other solution .

It is beyond doubt that some kind of international great game is all behind this . Just like the 9/11 . How can a camel runner hit 100+ floor ? Even the Afghans did n't know how use the electric lifts .  Recommend0  Krishna Prasad  Oct 04 , 2014 09:58pm  Let us see what Pakistan - state and its establishment would respond to these groups . If your government has a direction and action plan . If these institutions are pro-active be removed once for all and ensure that there is clarity as regards its approach and timeliness , it would be better for entire Pakistan 's population and entire world . Trust me a good dead is supported by 1000 others once they see the intent and will of the government . Sitting on the fence and not knowing what to do will not take away the problem on hand .  Recommend0  Gaz  Oct 04 , 2014 09:59pm  IS are the enemies of Islam and if it was not for a bad economy Pakistan ground forces should have joined the up coming assault on them cuz you can not rely on the arab armies they experts in defeat and in oppressing their own people .

Bombings are still going on and innocent lives are being lost . Does any one care ? I do n't think it was very wise move to send in the troops and destroy legitimate businesses and properties of ordinary people . Every day there are reports of bombings . So what was achieved other than disruption of so many lives ? There is a cheering crowd for the army 's action but what 's the end point ? Was army given a specific mission or is it another occupation by the state . In the later case , do n't expect peace any time soon .

It should be great concern to us . The Government and the people of Pakistan should see this unholy trend as a dire away . They may loose some people here and there but our people are and would remain the main target of these madness . STOP it . TTP and IS are working against the basic and long-term interests of countries with Muslim majorities .

Hope Indians will understand that Pakistan itself is biggest sufferer of terrorism .  Recommend0  Bharat Kumar Jaiswal  Oct 04 , 2014 11:36pm  @karmat It is not related to Kashmir .
