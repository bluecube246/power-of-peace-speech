<h> Malik calls for probe into sacking of man who expelled him from flight <p> Senator Rehman Malik says he has asked for a parliamentary committee to investigate allegations that he politically influenced the job termination of a man who led and filmed his expulsion from a PIA flight . <p> The video clip , filmed by former Gerry 's Group general manager Arjumand Azhar Hussain and showing irate passengers expelling Malik for a delay of a PIA flight , had gone viral on the social media . <p> Hussain was fired from his job at the Gerry 's Group earlier this week , with rumours circulating that the termination was the result of political pressure exerted by Senator Malik , who was the federal interior minister from 2008 to 2013 during the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) led government . <p> Malik took to social media early Friday , tweeting a letter he said he has written to the Senate chairman asking him to form a parliamentary committee to probe the media reports and ' false allegations ' against him . <p> " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electronic media reports wherein a false allegation has been levelled that I got Arjumand Azhar terminated from his job by using my political pressure , " he writes in the letter addressed to the Senate chairman . <p> " I had earlier stated in the media that I have no role whatsoever in his termination . I would like to request you to kindly have the following investigated by a Parliamentary Committee to bring the real facts in front of the public , " writes Malik . <p> He further asks the committee to determine the " real facts " behind Hussain 's termination , and to ascertain if any political pressure or influence was exerted by him for Hussain 's termination . <p> Malik also tweeted two other similar letters -- one addressed to Hussain expressing his sympathies over his termination and offering legal help , and the other asking the chairman of the Travel Agents Association of Pakistan ( TAAP ) to investigate the matter . <p> Earlier this week , Gerry 's Group denied that the sacking was due to political influence or that it had anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " purely based on merit " . <p> In a post on Facebook , Gerry Group said Hussain " was a new employee whose services were subject to successful completion of probation and his performance was under review at which point the company decided not to confirm his appointment " . <p> " We realise that the timings of his employment probation and his video recording are not too distant hence Arjumand Hussain has used this to politicise the matter to his advantage , " said the Gerry 's group . <p> Hussain has not yet responded to Malik 's offer of help or call for an investigation into the allegations .
