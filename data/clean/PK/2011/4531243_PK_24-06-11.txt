http://www.greatreporter.com/content/launch-new-uk-christian-music-magazine

the magazine is available to purchase now at **29;288;toolong and soon from major christian booksellers , with a view to getting the magazine on the newsagent shelves .  " it 's about time " says editor/owner dee blackmore . " there are no christian music magazines on the shelves at the moment and i do n't know why this is the case . i would love to see my magazine sit alongside the nme , and mojo in the ' music ' section . some people say it is too niche , but so is classical music and its there . "  " it has long been my intention to showcase to anyone who wants to listen , the variety and quality of ' christian music ' and this meaning ' music made by christians ' . there is no such thing as ' christian music ' per se , unless you 're defining it as ' worship music ' , or ' gospel ' . i 'd like to say to christians and non-christians alike buy the magazine , visit my websites , in christians . pop , rock , ska , r&amp;b , i 'm sure you 'll find something you 'll like " .  " this magazine is the culmination of what i 've been striving for for the past few years - to get contemporary christian music into the mainstream . i have been perplexed that such multi-award winning and album selling bands like jars of clay , skillet , mercyme , casting crowns , and third day - people who happen to be christians and who may not necessarily write overtly christian songs , are relatively unheard of in the uk . i have also wondered why christian artists did not want their music defined as ' christian ' . i now know that being ' labelled ' as such , meant that their music simply was n't being listened to by non-christians and therefore did n't receive the same coverage as that of their mainstream counterparts . i 'm sure this must be frustrating , as every musician wants their music to be heard by as wide an audience as possible . "  dee is also calling for official christian music chart in the uk . amazon and itunes have us equivalents , and there 's the billboard chart , which we use . if there was a chart that was readily accessible , we will know of and see more of these artists in the mainstream .
