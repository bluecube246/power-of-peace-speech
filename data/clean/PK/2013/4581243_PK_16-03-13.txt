Are we Conscientious as a Nuclear Power ?  No matter what potential insecurities Americans might have with our nuclear safety , Pakistan accords the highest priority ensuring a foolproof nuclear security mechanism . And it 's no wonder that Pakistan has the reputation of being an active member of the Nuclear Security Summit ( NSS ) and Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism ( GICNT ) .  According to Strategic Planning Division ( SPD ) , over 8000 additional professionals are being trained at Pakistan 's specialized Nuclear Security Training Academy to assume their duties proficiently in a short period of time . This brings the number of specially trained personnel to the figure of over 20,000 personnel . Besides , a Nuclear and Radiological Emergency Coordination Center ( NRECC ) with fully equipped mobile labs , is working on technical assistance with law enforcement agencies and the first responders .  The conscientious Pakistan continues to refine and upgrade its technical and human resources and mechanisms on safety and security of nuclear weapons , materials , facilities , and assets . As Pakistan has it has established a " Center of Excellence " ready to share nuclear experience and training facilities . Pakistan has subscribed to the IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources , and the IAEA Illicit Trafficking Database ( ITDB ) .  The escalation of the arms race in South Asia commenced when Obama administration signed US-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement . In order to put right the balance of power , Pakistan demanded for a similar civil-nuclear deal . But the administration deflected on it . As Pakistan lives in a tough neighborhood , therefore , it will never be oblivious to its security needs and should have deterrent capabilities as a nuclear power . Pakistani leadership is suspicious of US aims of controlling or limiting its weapons programme while favoring India .  In the backdrop of Mumbai terror attacks-2008 , India 's threats of carrying out surgical operation inside Pakistan if action is not taken against the perpetuators , clearly shows that India wants to assert itself as a super power capable of conducting an unchecked forays into foreign domain . According to would be to " roll the nuclear dice " . It could trigger the world 's first use of nuclear weapons . This alarming scenario point Pakistan in the direction of a larger nuclear force that requires a greater amount of fissile material .  While analyzing the nuclear threat , it was generally agreed in the London meeting-2009 , that India and Pakistan view each other as enemies . Nuclear weapons are crucial to Pakistan , because Pakistani military is no match for the Indian army .  Therefore , Pakistan is justified to work on producing smaller tactical nuclear weapons that can provide ' deterrence ' against Indian nuclear might . However , Pakistan is determined to continue to follow a responsible policy of maintaining credible minimum deterrence in the nuclearized environment of South Asia . The spokesman of Pakistan Foreign Office said , " Pakistan is mindful of the need to avoid an arms race with India but would never compromise on its national security . "  All States need to shoulder their shared responsibility to strengthen regulatory mechanisms and establish effective barriers against the common threat an Indian delusion -- just as Pakistani nuke is a delusion against India -- " sub thath puRaa ruh jaavegaa jub laad chaley gaa banjara " .  Nukes are instruments of collective suicide .  Farooq Hashmi  Noted for compliance .  Farooq Hashmi  Lalaji , Just provoke Pakistan to try them .  Farooq Hashmi  Vulpine Gandhiji and his sidekick Mr.Nehru outwitted a fox in their filthy design of keeping Muslims under Hindus ' thumb for ever ..  http : **30;162;TOOLONG Shivanshu Goswami  Then why did Gandhi stand so vehemently for rights of muslims . Its funny to see Indians hating Gandhi for supporting muslims , and Pakistanis hating him for supporting Hindus .  M.Saeed  Gandhi hated his own son who adopted Islam !  Farooq Hashmi  Caravans march and dogs bark .  Farooq Hashmi  The blogger has remarked that in a conciliatory tone . It 's not seventies of the 20th century . It 's teen years of the 21st century in which both the countries are armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons . Any war between be obliterated . Jingoism of you and some other numb-skulls of country are dangerously fanning the belligerent sentiments  http : **30;194;TOOLONG Shivanshu Goswami  Most people in the two counties are so misfortunate , that a jingoist/heroic death seems better than living their miserable lives .  Farooq Hashmi  His comment is the stink of the oral diarrhea of ' The Hindu ' newspaper of Bharat .  http : **30;226;TOOLONG Shivanshu Goswami  " The Hindu " is a very responsible , leftist inclined newspaper and never publishes such hate filled words . Blame your own notorious moderator for this .  Wan na quote a bad Indian newspaper ? Quote the " Times of India " .  M.Saeed  My dear Goswami , I also maintained the same views about " The Hindu " , not long ago and tried to register for my comments after getting fed-up with TOI 's lack of decency/decorum . But then , I saw some readers ' comments published that even crossed the TOI 's limits ! You can check yourself simply by observing any news now published in it  Poor thing Bharat ! How cruel the world is that it 's knitting its eye-brows at Bharat for keeping " a few " nukes " as a deterrence against China " , and how war-hysteric Pakistan is that it has 200 nuclear war-heads to " brow-beat " Bharat ! Pakistan 's security apprehensions at Bharat 's nukes are unfounded , The posterity of the " angel " Kotylia , the " noble-hearted " Bharatis are keeping them only " as a deterrence against China , yes , only " as a deterrence against China . " Pakistanis should not take Bharatis ' " assurance " with a grain of salt .  http : **30;258;TOOLONG Shivanshu Goswami  Yeah , they should prepare for genocide instead , while millions are without electricity or education in Pakistan . Please compare the % spending on defense education and poverty reduction by the two countries .  As an honest enemy , I suggest you to not take chances with your security . But as a human being , I implore you to see reason and stop this madness .  M.Saeed  Hyderabad-Duccan on majority Hindu basis and did the opposite in Muslim majority J&amp;K ?  Do n't you see the Junagardh example of Pakistan 's fairness on principles ?  Mirza Baig , India  Where are these presently being used freely and excessively ? Be prepared at the same place they would be used /experimented first . What you have been sowing , so shall you will be reaping . Congratulations  Mirza Baig , India  And what about innocents being butchered daily in Balochistan , Karachi , Gilgit , FATA in sectarian killings and that also not other than by our own Muslims . Muslims are killing Muslims . Is it not a shame for you .  http : **30;290;TOOLONG Shivanshu Goswami  " Innocent people in India ? "  So the excessive actions of a few Indian army men makes everyone in India guilty . By your logic , the actions of a handful of terrorists are sufficient to call all muslims terrorists . You are making the logical fallacy of generalization .  Also , you conveniently ignore the countless murders of Kashmiri pandits  I agree , with every word . Saner people need to raise their voices . Most people in the two counties are so misfortunate , that a jingoist/heroic death seems better than living their miserable lives .  Nasir Amin  Well Indians I wish your lovely , golden words and comments are reflected in the policies of your policy makers and actions of your government as well .
