A totally insane person has no value of human life does n't know how people are living in the country and how many are committing suicide due poverty , unemployment and hunger . Only cares is about is his damn money and bank accounts . He is certainly an inspiration for thieves that how a lotter and theif can become a President .

Comment by Tariq : ( April 17th , 2012 at 7:55 pm )  I agree with the writer above . Zardari thinks either people of Pakistan are insane or blind . As they do n't know what is going around them . Zardari is the most shameless person ever born . Who is not afraid to lie in front of thousands of people . I feel sad that our Armed forces , and Judiciary are sitting , and watching these group of hand to destablise our beloved Pakistan . Allah bless &amp; protect Pakistan
