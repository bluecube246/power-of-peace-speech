Accountability for Alesha's death

the tragic murder of alesha , a prominent member of peshawar 's transgender community , on may 26 , represented bigotry and discrimination against the community at various levels . alesha was firstly a victim of a hate crime when she was shot six times by assailants . she then became a victim again at the hands of the staff at the lady reading hospital ( lrh ) , which wasted precious time ridiculing her and debating whether to treat her in the male or female ward , instead of providing immediate treatment that could have saved her life . this behaviour rightly invited uproar and scorn , and while an earlier inquiry into the affair was dismissed for not being impartial , the latest investigation of the matter has laid bare the facts of what went on at the lrh and has also pinned responsibility for the bigoted treatment that alesha received . the khyber-pakhtunkhwa health department has now urged the lrh 's board of governors ( bog ) to act on the findings of the inquiry report and take action against the negligent individuals . , alesha could have survived . she was n't treated as an emergency patient and a recommendation to initiate criminal cases against the medical director , hospital director and professors of surgical and orthopaedic wards has been made . as lrh is subject to the 2015 medical teaching institutions reforms law , the government is unable to take direct action against those responsible . however , that does not mean that the hospital has blanket impunity to do as it pleases . the bog must take action against the concerned individuals as recommended by the inquiry report . according to universal oaths , hospital staff must treat all patients regardless of their gender and socio-economic backgrounds . it is important now to set the right precedent against bigoted and incompetent behaviour so that other health establishments fine-tune their protocols in case they face a similar situation .
