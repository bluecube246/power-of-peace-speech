mullah akhtar death likely to enrage pakistan  on wednesday , sartaj aziz , pakistan 's de facto foreign minister , told a gathering of top diplomats from afghanistan , the us and china that the 2015 leak of news that former taliban leader mullah omar had been dead for more than two years " not only scuttled the afghan peace process , it also let to the splintering of the taliban " . days later a us drone fired a missile at omar 's successor , mullah akhtar mansoor , as he travelled in the southern pakistan province of balochistan . the attack , which the taliban have confirmed killed mansoor , marks an extraordinary escalation of a drone campaign that appeared to be winding down and has in the past been a running sore in us-pakistani relations . the government in islamabad did not immediately respond to the news whilst pakistan 's media , which often follows directions from the country 's security establishment , did not rush to condemn the strike as a breach of the country 's sovereignty . many of the country heavily pakistan invested in helping mansoor secure the leadership of the taliban after a power struggle broke out following the announcement of omar 's death . islamabad has long argued the only way to end the war in afghanistan is to try to coax a united taliban to the table for peace talks . it has dismissed calls to take military action against an insurgent group whose support networks operate freely in pakistan , saying attempts to start negotiations must be exhausted first . but amid deadly taliban attacks , including an april suicide bombing in kabul that killed 64 people , the afghan government has run out of patience with islamabad and has demanded firm action against taliban networks based on pakistani soil . the killing of mansoor suggests the us agrees with the demands of the afghan president , ashraf ghani , that " irreconcilable " insurgents based in pakistan should be targeted . in a highly unusual public statement about a drone strike , a pentagon official described mansoor as " an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of afghanistan and the taliban , prohibiting taliban " . but is far from clear whether mansoor 's death will smooth the way to an end to the conflict . he has no obvious successor , though one of his two appointed deputies may assume power in the immediate aftermath . neither is known as a proponent of reconciliation . one , haibatullah akhundzada , a renowned cleric from the taliban heartland of kandahar , is a relatively unknown figure outside the movement . according to the un , haibatullah is the taliban 's former chief justice . though he was seemingly close to the movement 's founder , mullah omar , it is unclear how much influence he holds over taliban foot soldiers . the other deputy , sirajuddin haqqani , is the leader of the haqqani network , which has risen to prominence in the taliban in recent years and taken on a more central role in the insurgency . while the haqqanis do not have clout over fighters in the south , mansoor 's death could further strengthen the group 's position within the insurgency , making reconciliation even more unattainable . the killing of mansoor happened well outside the tribal agencies of north and south waziristan where nearly all known strikes have taken place , usually focusing on al-qaida and allied groups . us officials said the attack took place near ahmad wal , suggesting it was the first ever known strike in the vast southern province of balochistan , where the insurgency 's " quetta shura " leadership council is thought to be based , and one of very few to target a senior member of the afghan taliban . the drones were described as having been piloted by us special forces -- suggesting it was not a cia operation , as is usually the case with attacks inside pakistan . -- courtesy : the guardian
