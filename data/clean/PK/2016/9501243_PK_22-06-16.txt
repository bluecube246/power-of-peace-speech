canada has ' real concerns ' about russia : trudeau  ottawa : canadian prime minister justin trudeau on wednesday expressed " real concerns " over a more assertive russia , as his government reportedly considers taking command of a new nato battalion in the baltics .  " we have real concerns about russia and about its actions and we will be thoughtful and firm , as i have always been , on how we re-engage with russia , " trudeau told a press conference .  speaking ahead of a landmark summit in warsaw on july 8-9 , the prime minister reiterated canada 's demand that russia abide by the minsk agreement , which called for a ceasefire and a range of political , economic and social measures to end the conflict in eastern ukraine .  the ethnically russian region remains a flashpoint , and violence there occurs almost daily .  russia is accused by ukraine and its western allies of fomenting trouble on the heels of its annexation of crimea after the pro-moscow regime in kiev was ousted by a popular revolt illegitimate and irresponsible . "  earlier , russian president vladimir putin slammed nato for its " aggressive actions " close to russia 's border , warning that it was forcing russia to increase its military capacity .  nato said last week that it would deploy 4,000 troops to estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland to deter russia and reassure allies .  ottawa has reportedly been asked to command one of the four battalions .  france 's government , meanwhile , said on wednesday that a new summit on ukraine is possible next month in light of " progress " in the crisis .
