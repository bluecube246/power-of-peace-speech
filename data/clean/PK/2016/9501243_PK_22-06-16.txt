Canada has ' real concerns ' about Russia : Trudeau  OTTAWA : Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday expressed " real concerns " over a more assertive Russia , as his government reportedly considers taking command of a new NATO battalion in the Baltics .  " We have real concerns about Russia and about its actions and we will be thoughtful and firm , as I have always been , on how we re-engage with Russia , " Trudeau told a press conference .  Speaking ahead of a landmark summit in Warsaw on July 8-9 , the prime minister reiterated Canada 's demand that Russia abide by the Minsk agreement , which called for a ceasefire and a range of political , economic and social measures to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine .  The ethnically Russian region remains a flashpoint , and violence there occurs almost daily .  Russia is accused by Ukraine and its western allies of fomenting trouble on the heels of its annexation of Crimea after the pro-Moscow regime in Kiev was ousted by a popular revolt illegitimate and irresponsible . "  Earlier , Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed NATO for its " aggressive actions " close to Russia 's border , warning that it was forcing Russia to increase its military capacity .  NATO said last week that it would deploy 4,000 troops to Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland to deter Russia and reassure allies .  Ottawa has reportedly been asked to command one of the four battalions .  France 's government , meanwhile , said on Wednesday that a new summit on Ukraine is possible next month in light of " progress " in the crisis .
