<p> LONDON : Footballing powerhouse the Premier League weighed into the EU referendum debate on Monday , saying a departure from the European Union would go against the " openness " of the league and all of its clubs . <p> " Nobody bears the scars more than me of having to go and negotiate in Brussels and try and organise things a little bit in our interests in terms of the European machine , " Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore told BBC radio . <p> But he added : " Ultimately you ca n't break away , you ca n't just pull out , you have to get in and negotiate and try and organise and try and influence . <p> " There is an openness about the Premier League which I think it would be completely incongruous if we were to take the opposite position , " he added . <p> Scudamore : " We 'd rather be in there arguing with the European Commission than out and having things impact on us with no voice "
