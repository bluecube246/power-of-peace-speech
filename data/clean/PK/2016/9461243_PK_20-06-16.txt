london : footballing powerhouse the premier league weighed into the eu referendum debate on monday , saying a departure from the european union would go against the " openness " of the league and all of its clubs .  " nobody bears the scars more than me of having to go and negotiate in brussels and try and organise things a little bit in our interests in terms of the european machine , " premier league executive chairman richard scudamore told bbc radio .  but he added : " ultimately you ca n't break away , you ca n't just pull out , you have to get in and negotiate and try and organise and try and influence .  " there is an openness about the premier league which i think it would be completely incongruous if we were to take the opposite position , " he added .  scudamore : " we 'd rather be in there arguing with the european commission than out and having things impact on us with no voice "
