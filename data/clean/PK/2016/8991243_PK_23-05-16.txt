Blessings of Shab-i-Barat  As it always happens when Shab-I-Barat comes , people start to explode crackers . It seems not the blessed night but the night of crackers . Shab-I-Barat is a blessed night and Muslims celebrate this night with prayers and charities . But has anybody ever considered what the purpose of this night actually is ? This night is the night of forgiveness . But today the Muslims have forgot the reality and they instead of prayers cook sweet dish and explode crackers . Today when we ask somebody why they celebrate this night , the usual answer is that our ancestors celebrated this night therefore we do it as well . Illiterate as well as educated people buy crackers for their children gladly so that they explode them , causing great trouble for their neighbours . They should think of their neighbours where someone may be sick or preparing for exams . May Allah bless us with right thinking and courage to act on it . -- Rawalpindi
