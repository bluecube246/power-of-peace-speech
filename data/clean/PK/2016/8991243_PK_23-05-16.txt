blessings of shab-i-barat  as it always happens when shab-i-barat comes , people start to explode crackers . it seems not the blessed night but the night of crackers . shab-i-barat is a blessed night and muslims celebrate this night with prayers and charities . but has anybody ever considered what the purpose of this night actually is ? this night is the night of forgiveness . but today the muslims have forgot the reality and they instead of prayers cook sweet dish and explode crackers . today when we ask somebody why they celebrate this night , the usual answer is that our ancestors celebrated this night therefore we do it as well . illiterate as well as educated people buy crackers for their children gladly so that they explode them , causing great trouble for their neighbours . they should think of their neighbours where someone may be sick or preparing for exams . may allah bless us with right thinking and courage to act on it . -- rawalpindi
