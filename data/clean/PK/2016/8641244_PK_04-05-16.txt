However , due to a mismanagement of funds which resulted in a bankruptcy last summer , 50 Cent was superseded by Drake , who has increased his net worth through touring , music releases and business deals with popular beverage and athletic clothing brands .  Drake , a Toronto native who prefers going by his middle name , recently released his fourth album titled Views , which sold an estimated 630,000 copies on its April 29 release date , according to Vibe Magazine .  With each album selling at $13.99 exclusively on iTunes , the 29-year-old made about $800,000 that very night . The rapper stepped into the limelight with the launch on his first solo album Thank Me Later in 2010 . The album debuted at the top of the US Billboard 200 list during its first week .  Business mogul and rap artist Diddy continued to hold the number one title with a net worth of $750 million thanks to his agreement with a vodka brand , stakes in his music television network Revolt , his clothing line Sean John and more Jay Z in third place with $610 million and finally Birdman , who falls in fourth place with $110 million .
