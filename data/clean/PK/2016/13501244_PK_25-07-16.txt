http://tribune.com.pk/story/1148882/analysis-america-hillary-trump/

the race for the white house has come down to its former resident and a loudmouth celebrity . while one is well versed with norms of international law and diplomacy , the other is very much a dark horse . hillary clinton is an establishment candidate while donald 's trump-ism is new to the grand old party , or more commonly the republican party . the country 's first female presidential nominee has already withstood a robust revolt within the democratic party with the rise of senator bernie sanders .  nonetheless , us voters are bracing for a very close contest . by far , the presidential election will be the most globally followed event in history , courtesy donald trump 's meteoric ascent . devoid of consistency and ignorant of the state system , the man has bulldozed every opponent in his way . however , after winning the party nomination and choosing a running mate , things may change for the better . the republican campaign will be more coherent in conduct and consistent in policy formulations than trump 's .  owing to and losing to senator barack obama , hillary will have to make a few alterations , which may include embracing some of bernie 's discourse . though her stint as secretary of state was not the most incredible one , she set the record for racking up the most air miles . the democratic nominee is an experienced white house insider , equally at ease with national matters and international politics .  for the next administration in washington , the south china sea and the middle east will be two key areas of anxiety . presidential debates will shed some light on how the either camp comprehends both the issues . while hillary is least likely to continue obama-kerry russia-leaning policy on syria , the trump side has yet to articulate its consistent stance on the matter .  though the democrats ' stance has been relatively softer and pragmatic on china , the republican approach continues to be hostile . during both his terms in office , obama has consolidated washington 's india policy to counterweigh china in the region . the republicans are set to up the ante is weighing in big time on either side of the race . during the 2008 campaign , obama attacked hillary for her relations with wealthy indian-americans and her support for outsourcing to india . she was also taunted as a democrat from indian province of punjab . her indian lobbyists are sprinting to seize the opportunity this time around .  on the republican side , there seems to be no dearth of enthusiastic indians and their donations . shalabh kumar , founder of republican hindu coalition , has so far raised $899,000 for trump campaign and has set a target of $1.1 million for trump 's presidential bid . kumar is keen to see profiling and ejection of muslims alongside monitoring of their religious gatherings and institutions . much to the joy of his pro-modi lobbyists , trump has already branded pakistan a ' semi-unstable ' country with nuclear weapons . he even hinted at seeking india 's help in fixing pakistan . the so-called billionaire may be widely popular in india ; however , many believe he will act differently in the oval office .  on the contrary indian-americans , new delhi sees her as a mature and dependable politician . despite her chief of staff , huma abedin , being of pakistani origin , the democrat nominee has been tough on islamabad during her stint as secretary of state . yet , a sizeable pakistani diaspora supported her campaign for nomination . the clintons have had quite a few close pakistani-american friends .  contrary to the indian community in america , there are few pakistanis supporting trump bid for the white house . however , much depends on how his camp articulates the policies as so far his statements have not only been factually incorrect but also contradictory .  with pakistan offering economic corridor to china , islamabad has been facing renewed ire from the us as well as india . pakistan also supports china 's position in south china sea . conservatives in the us believe islamabad will offer gwadar as a naval base at a later stage . the likes of zalmay khalilzad , former bush era top diplomat , demand denuclearising pakistan and branding it alongside north korea .  undoubtedly , pakistan-us with the likelihood of a fresh set of nuclear or security related sanctions . either side is faced with some crucial questions : will pakistan be able to de-hyphenate itself from china while conducting diplomacy with the us ? can washington abandon islamabad yet again , while afghanistan is still marred with insurgency ? how far will us-india partnership help resolve the jammu and kashmir and water-sharing dispute ? how wise will it be for hillary or trump 's america to push an ally state in chinese bloc ?  naveed ahmad is a pakistani investigative journalist and academic with extensive reporting experience in the middle east and north africa . he is based in doha and istanbul . he tweets @naveed360
