Tips for happier tenants  1 There is a lot of ignorance and prejudice about renting . Look and learn for yourself . Learn about costs , savings , rights and duties . Think about long-term as well as short-term issues - especially about your home and where you work .  2 One of the best places to learn about renting is from the PRTB on prtb.ie . It 's the Private Residential Tenancies Board - they give an authoritative and independent overview for both landlords and tenants .  3 Renting gives predictability , choice , flexibility and value . Research the advantages of renting - there are surprisingly many at different stages of your life . Renting does n't always mean an apartment - it can also mean a house .  4 Long-term renters need to make pension or saving provision for accommodation after retirement when income reduces significantly . Homeowners eventually have an asset once they have paid off their mortgage - make sure that you make long-term income plans if you are making long-term rental plans .  5 Rent within not cost more than 30-50pc ( max ! ) of your income . Location is the single biggest factor in cost - however , time and travel are also costs , a monthly short hop ticket will cost ? 119 . Factor this into your calculations .  6 Have realistic rent expectations - places are smaller , older and more expensive nearer city centres - further out they are bigger , newer and cheaper . " Older is colder " is a good general rule - modern accommodation can cost significantly less to occupy than older places .  7 Renting is changing quite quickly in Ireland because of changes in law and practice . As more and more people rent , it is likely to continue to change .  8 Renting gives important flexibility for some types of employment . Patterns of employment see many people changing jobs more and more frequently - especially in the high-tech sectors . Renting can make this easier , especially if you are likely to spend time working abroad .
