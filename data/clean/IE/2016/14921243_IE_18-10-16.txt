Little Mix 's Jade takes the piss out of Zayn and it 's gas  Our all-time favourite girl band are making headlines this week for their scathing new single which undoubtedly takes down Zayn Malik .  The lyrics are CUTTING with powerhouse Perrie belting out " I hope she gettin ' better sex . Hope she ai n't fakin ' it like I did , babe . Took four long years to call it quits.Forget that boy , I 'm over it . "  And , in case the band did n't make it clear that they hate the former 1D singer , a new video of Jade ripping it out of Zayn has emerged .  In the clip uploaded to the bands snapchat , Jesy can be heard telling Jade to " do her audition . " Her bandmate then launches into a superb imitation of Zayn 's awkward X-Factor audition .  The Little Mix ladies have just released a book , entitled Our World , where they discuss the various highs and lows throughout their time as a band . on the internet , Perrie has talked about the breakdown of her and Zayn 's coupledom and how that came about by text message .  Part of the extract reads :  " I 'm single at the moment and in a really good place . I feel like I 'm stronger and happier than I 've been in a long time . I 've bought a house and it 's like I 've found my independence after going through a really rough time . '  " It was horrible , the worst time in my life . A four-year relationship , two-year engagement ended by a simple text message . Just like that . Even though things in my career were going really well , it was incredibly difficult for me " .  At the time of their break-up , it had been suggested that the split happened through a text but Perrie had n't addressed the issue until now .  The hashtag #PerrieExposedZaynParty started trending as screen grabs of the aforementioned extract were posted by numerous Twitter users .
