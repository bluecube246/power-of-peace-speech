<h> Here 's why your boss should let you listen to music at work <h> But happy music . <p> MUSIC CAN DRASTICALLY enhance the spirit of co-operation in a workplace , a new study suggests . <p> In the paper newly published by the Journal of Organizational Behavior , Cornell researchers Kevin Kniffin , Jubo Yan , Brian Wansink and William Schulze describe two studies they conducted to test the effect of different types of music on the cooperative behavior of individuals working as a team . <p> For each study , participants were grouped into teams of three . Each team member was given multiple opportunities to either contribute to the team 's value using tokens or keep the tokens for personal use . <p> When happy , upbeat music was played -- researchers chose the Happy Days theme song , Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison , Yellow Submarine by the Beatles and Walking on Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves -- team members were more likely to contribute to the group 's value . <p> When music deemed unpleasant was played -- in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- participants were more likely to keep tokens for themselves . <p> The researchers found contribution levels to the public good when happy , upbeat songs were played were approximately one-third higher compared to the less pleasant music . <p> When researchers conducted a second experiment testing how people react when no music is played , the results were the same . The researchers conclude that happy music provokes people to more often make decisions that contribute to the good of the team . <p> " Music is a pervasive part of much of our daily lives , whether we consciously notice it or not , " said Kniffin , a behavioural scientist at Cornell and lead author on the paper . <p> The researchers suggest managers consider not only the customer experience but also workers ' when picking the day 's music . <p> TheJournal.ie is a full participating member of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman .
