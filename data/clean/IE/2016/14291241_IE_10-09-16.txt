Here 's why your boss should let you listen to music at work  But happy music .  MUSIC CAN DRASTICALLY enhance the spirit of co-operation in a workplace , a new study suggests .  In the paper newly published by the Journal of Organizational Behavior , Cornell researchers Kevin Kniffin , Jubo Yan , Brian Wansink and William Schulze describe two studies they conducted to test the effect of different types of music on the cooperative behavior of individuals working as a team .  For each study , participants were grouped into teams of three . Each team member was given multiple opportunities to either contribute to the team 's value using tokens or keep the tokens for personal use .  When happy , upbeat music was played -- researchers chose the Happy Days theme song , Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison , Yellow Submarine by the Beatles and Walking on Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves -- team members were more likely to contribute to the group 's value .  When music deemed unpleasant was played -- in this -- participants were more likely to keep tokens for themselves .  The researchers found contribution levels to the public good when happy , upbeat songs were played were approximately one-third higher compared to the less pleasant music .  When researchers conducted a second experiment testing how people react when no music is played , the results were the same . The researchers conclude that happy music provokes people to more often make decisions that contribute to the good of the team .  " Music is a pervasive part of much of our daily lives , whether we consciously notice it or not , " said Kniffin , a behavioural scientist at Cornell and lead author on the paper .  The researchers suggest managers consider not only the customer experience but also workers ' when picking the day 's music .
