<p> Former stable companion Val De Ferbet , who is having his first run for trainer Andrew McNamara , was the best of these over hurdles , but is entitled to need this run -- his first for nine months . <p> Stowaway Shark can take the two-and-a-half-mile maiden hurdle for Shark Hanlon . <p> The seven-year-old won a point-to-point in late 2013 and made a promising bumper debut in early 2014 , but was off for more than a year and a half until making his comeback in December . <p> He has had three runs since his return , all over hurdles , and there was increasing promise with each experience . <p> Last time , he finished fourth of nine behind smart prospect Jett , and that line of form stands out in the context of today 's race . <p> He can be expected to take another step forward , and is preferred to Gran Cavallo , who ran well behind Oscar Lantern on his track debut , but was a touch below that form next time . <p> Captainofthefleet could represent some value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-year-old struggled to find his form on his first two runs of the season , but there was more promise in his latest effort , just eight days ago , when he finished eight behind Total Recall in a hot handicap at Naas . <p> That was over two miles , and the return to three miles will suit the course and distance winner . <p> While Dallas Cowboy is likely to prove popular in the betting , Captainofthefleet will be a much bigger price , and is preferred on those grounds .
