former stable companion val de ferbet , who is having his first run for trainer andrew mcnamara , was the best of these over hurdles , but is entitled to need this run -- his first for nine months .  stowaway shark can take the two-and-a-half-mile maiden hurdle for shark hanlon .  the seven-year-old won a point-to-point in late 2013 and made a promising bumper debut in early 2014 , but was off for more than a year and a half until making his comeback in december .  he has had three runs since his return , all over hurdles , and there was increasing promise with each experience .  last time , he finished fourth of nine behind smart prospect jett , and that line of form stands out in the context of today 's race .  he can be expected to take another step forward , and is preferred to gran cavallo , who ran well behind oscar lantern on his track debut , but was a touch below that form next time .  captainofthefleet could represent some value nine-year-old struggled to find his form on his first two runs of the season , but there was more promise in his latest effort , just eight days ago , when he finished eight behind total recall in a hot handicap at naas .  that was over two miles , and the return to three miles will suit the course and distance winner .  while dallas cowboy is likely to prove popular in the betting , captainofthefleet will be a much bigger price , and is preferred on those grounds .
