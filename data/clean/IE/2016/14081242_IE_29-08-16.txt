blue economy synergies prompt ucc-led maribe to seek ? 120m funding  emboldened by synergies between researchers and start-ups targeting the ? 500bn european marine or " blue " economy , the ucc-led maribe consortium is to seek ? 120m in funding to be made available in the next round of horizon 2020 funding .  maribe ( marine investment in the blue economy ) is led by the marine renewable energy ( marei ) centre in university college cork . a total of 11 partners from ireland , uk , belgium , spain , italy , malta and the netherlands contribute to the project .  at a final meeting in cork this week , maribe will discuss the outcomes of its research , as well as the progress of nine fledgling companies that are seeking funding .  according to the european commission , the blue economy represents roughly 5.4m jobs and generates a gross added value of almost ? 500bn a year . maribe suggests that the recent announcement by the port of cork that its profits for 2015 have increased by 79pc is activity increases , so does the competition for space as coastal areas become overcrowded .  overcrowded coastal areas threaten blue economy windfall  this fact led the european commission to publish a call in 2014 asking researchers to prepare for the future innovative offshore economy . expecting economic activities to move further offshore as competition for space increased , this call was designed to promote smarter and more sustainable use of our seas .  maribe will recommend in its report to the european commission that ? 120m be made available in the next round of horizon 2020 funding for further development of multi-use ocean space projects .  it pays particular attention to new and emerging industries that can benefit greatly from the synergies created , increasing their chances of survival and enabling future growth .  these sectors are often referred to as blue growth industries : marine renewable energy , aquaculture , marine biotechnology and seabed mining . by developing blue growth industries and encouraging smarter use of our seas , maribe hopes to fulfil its aim of promoting job growth .  examples of the blue industries as competition for space increases , a norwegian seaweed company ses has been investigating the potential of moving their seaweed farms further offshore .  by combining with wave dragon , a very large wave energy device , the seaweed company could locate farms in areas not normally considered viable and where space remains abundant . the wave dragon protects the seaweed from large waves and creates energy at the same time .  maribe pointed out that 70pc of the world 's surface is covered by water and yet 98pc of our food energy comes from agriculture on land . at a time when climate change and sustainability issues are coming to the fore , seaweed farming presents a sustainable and renewable source of biomass to meet the demands of a growing population .  by sharing space and working together , wave dragon and ses could share installation and maintenance costs , reducing the overall cost to each .  " it is hoped to pilot the wave dragon project off the welsh coast , " said ucc 's dr gordon dalton , principal investigator of the programme the welsh scheme to prepare plans to secure the funding they require . "  another example of the synergy between the aquaculture and wave industry is a project that is being developed by albatern ltd and the aquabiotech group .  albatern 's wave energy devices could be installed close to a fish farm in locations ( ireland , scotland , wales and malta ) up to 6km offshore . the new wave energy device could then provide electricity directly to the fish farm , reducing its costs and ensuring a supply of sustainable energy . surplus energy could also be brought onshore to satisfy the energy needs of the farm 's onshore facilities .  " the multi-use of space projects that maribe works with offers the potential for great benefits in the form of clean energy and sustainable food sources . we have demonstrated that the projects are financially viable at commercial stage and that real cost savings are produced as a result of the shared use of space , " said dalton.
