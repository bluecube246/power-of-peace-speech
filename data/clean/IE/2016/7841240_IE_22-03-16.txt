<h> Brussels in state of chaos as police search for perpetrators of the attacks <h> Sarah Collins in Brussels <p> In this photo provided by Ralph Usbeck travellers stand in a smoke filled terminal at Brussels Airport , in Brussels after explosions Tuesday , March 22 , 2016 . <p> Brussels remains in a state of chaos this afternoon as army and police lock down the city following a succession of bomb blasts at the airport and a metro station that Belgian prime minister Charles Michel called " blind , violent and cowardly " . <p> Police cars and ambulances wail across the city while helicopters criss-cross the sky as police search for the perpetrators of the attacks . <p> All public transport has been suspended , children are being kept inside school gates and government and EU buildings have been put on high alert . <p> The Belgian federal public prosecutor has opened up a criminal inquiry into the attacks and Belgian media are reporting police raids are taking place across the city . <p> Eyewitnesses at the airport said the blast occurred near the entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where travellers access city centre train and bus links . <p> All passengers have now been evacuated from the scene , and all flights cancelled until at least tomorrow , the Brussels airport authority confirmed . <p> In Brussels city , EU institutions are in lockdown , with their internal terror alerts raised a notch following the blast at the Maelbeek metro station , which is located at the heart of the EU district . <p> One Irish official working in the institutions said he was advised not to leave the building , and to move away from offices with street-facing windows . <p> The Irish embassies in Brussels - both the bilateral embassy to Belgium and the Permanent Representation to the EU - say they have established the safety of all staff and have set up a Dublin-based number for people to call if they are worried about relatives and friends in the Belgian capital . <p> A spokesman for the European Commission said there was " no indication this was a terror attack on the EU institutions " and that the Belgian security services were in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness and agitation inside the Commission 's Berlaymont headquarters , where the 28 commissioners and their staff are housed . <p> Flags are flying at half-mast outside , and people are being advised not to leave if they are already inside the building and to stay home if they have not yet arrived . <p> Two of the European Commission 's offices - those closest to the Maelbeek metro station , where an explosion hit just after 9am local time - have been evacuated . <p> The staff canteen in one of the buildings , at 86 Rue de la Loi , is being used to treat the injured from the blast . <p> A hotel close to the metro station , the Thon Hotel on Rue de la Loi , is also acting as a makeshift hospital for the Maelbeek metro victims . <p> All qualified doctors from the EU institutions have been sent down to help deal with the carnage as the death toll mounts . <p> Many people on the street feel bewildered by the attacks , which seem to have been orchestrated to coincide with the busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Easter holidays . <p> They follow four days after the arrest of the most wanted man in Europe , Salah Abdeslam , a development which had brought the country - and the beleaguered security services - a mild sense of relief . <p> All that has evaporated now as Belgians prepare for another period of high alert , with army patrols on the streets , cancelled public events and public transport chaos . <h> Your Comments <p> Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted .
