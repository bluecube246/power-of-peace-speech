<h> The Ronan Lyons column : Feeding a rental market starved of homes <h> Ronan Lyons <p> The first two weeks of this column were focused on a perhaps unfamiliar measure of how healthy the housing sector is , by looking at how often the typical property changes hands . That , though , is a measure focused exclusively on the sales segment . As we know from the 2011 Census , nearly one third of households are renters . <p> This week and next , I 'll be taking a look at the health of the rental sector . The focus today will be to look again at quantities rather than prices . The latest edition of the Daft.ie Rental Report , which I author , was released earlier this week and showed a combination of rapidly rising rents and incredibly tight supply in the rental market . <p> The story about rental prices is , perhaps , reasonably well-known . In short , rents in Dublin have risen by more than 40pc since 2010 and are effectively back at their 2008 peak . The picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it so in Dublin 's commuter counties . Elsewhere in the country , rents began rising later - typic- ally in 2013 or 2014 - and remain more than 10pc below the peaks of nearly a decade ago . <p> But what about the availability of rental property ? There are two ways of looking at this . The first is to look at the stock of properties available to rent at any given time and track that . This is done in the Rental Report , taking the first of the month as a barometer , and figures go back to the start of 2006 . What this series shows is startling . <p> On February 1 , 2016 there were fewer than 3,600 properties available to rent nationwide . To put this in perspective , three years ago , nearly 12,000 were available to rent , and on the same date in 2009 there were more than 20,000 rental properties on the market . Perhaps a fairer comparison is with the last time rents were rising rapidly , in 2006 and 2007 . However , even in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . <p> This shows just how starved the rental market now is . In Cork , Galway , Limerick and Waterford cities combined , there were only 322 properties available to rent on February 1 this year . For some perspective , these four cities had more than 50,000 rental homes in the 2011 Census . <p> What makes this even more concerning is that the number of households renting has , in all likelihood , increased substantially over the five years since the last Census . During that period , the population of the country has increased by almost 100,000 people - roughly 40,000 households - but at a time when access to the owner-occupier market has been limited . <p> I have mentioned that the first way of viewing rental supply is to look at the stock available at any particular time . The second is to look at the flow - how many properties are put up for rent in a given period ? The figures accompanying this article show the total number of rental listings nationwide , each quarter , from the start of 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there is a dwindling number of properties being put up for rent . In the final three months of 2011 , more than 30,000 properties were advertised for rent . In the final three months of 2015 , just over 16,000 were listed . In a country with a growing number of renters , there is a decreasing number of properties available to them . <p> Over the course of 2015 , 80,000 properties were advertised for rent . With more than half-a-million households now renting in Ireland , this means only one in six rental properties was put up for rent . <p> Put another way , each rental property is changing hands once every six years . Renters who find somewhere to live are not interested in moving in a hurry . This undermines one of the advantages the rented sector has over the owner-occupied sector - mobility when needed . <p> Taken together , the signals from the rented sector in terms of availability are bad . This is the opposite to the owner-occupier segment where , despite the lack of new homes being built , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The rental sector , however , is where those at the margins live . This means policy-makers have an extra responsibility to ensure affordability and availability , particularly for those on lower incomes . Unfortunately , that is not the case . <p> Next week , we 'll connect up the rented and owner-occupied sectors and look at perhaps the single most important metric of the health of the housing sector - the ratio of prices to rents . <p> Ronan Lyons is Assistant Professor of Economics at Trinity College Dublin and author of the Daft.ie Reports <h> Your Comments <p> Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted .
