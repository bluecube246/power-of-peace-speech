<h> At The Centre Of It All : The History Of The Rugby Ball <p> It has witnessed thousands of moments of pure brilliance , been the source of controversy throughout rugby 's history and ultimately contributes to the uniqueness of the sport we all adore . <p> The humble rugby ball , formerly known as a ' quanco ' , is iconic in the game for its odd shape , completely different to almost every other sport . Whilst cricket , football , tennis and more use traditional spheres for their playing equipment , the rugby ball is an ' elongated ellipsoid ' or basically oval . <p> So why does the sport employ such a strange-shaped object ? Well , it turns out the ellipsoid makes it easier to pass with . Having said that , some of the world 's best players have made it seem like a doddle to kick such a bizarrely crafted ball . Yet there are some other curious reasons as to how the modern day ball evolved . <p> The history of the rugby ball goes back to some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Richard Lindon and Bernardo Solano used pigs ' bladders and leather casings . The original rugby balls were more plum shaped than oval . The pig 's bladder was inflated by mouth via the stem of a clay pipe then surrounded by panels of stitched leather , and the ball was not of a uniform size due to the variations in pig bladders used . <p> Lindon opened his first boot and shoemaker business at 6/6a Lawrence Sheriff Street , Rugby , England , straight across the road from the now famous Rugby School . Originally , Lindon supplied footwear to the people of Rugby , including staff and students at the School . <p> Lindon 's wife was responsible for inflating the pigs ' bladders . Unfortunately , this job did n't exactly meet current health and safety standards ; if the bladder was diseased , this was going into Mrs Lindon 's lungs . Eventually Mrs Lindon fell ill as a result and later passed away . <p> Roughly around 1862 Richard Lindon was desperate to find a replacement for the pig 's bladder and used an India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflate by mouth and so having been inspired by air syringes , he created a larger brass version to inflate his rugby balls . <p> The Rugby School wanted an oval ball produced to further distinguish their game from that of soccer football , so Lindon designed a more egg-shaped buttonless ball to be manufactured . This was the first specifically designed four-panel rugby ball and the start of sizes being standardised . In 1892 the RFU made it compulsory for all rugby balls to be oval in shape . <p> Continue reading below <p> Make sure to check the latest episode of our weekly rugby podcast , The Oval Office , where we look ahead to the Championship Cup , review the Rugby Championship and we catch up with Ireland prop Jack McGrath . <p> At the same time as all this was happening , Gilbert were manufacturing rugby balls to be used at Rugby School and by 1877 the family business was hand-stitching over 2,800 balls a year . ' Gilberts ' then began exporting their balls to Australia as the sport itself was growing . <p> The Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most international teams and by 1970 the company began to manufacture the balls in white as well as the traditional leather colour previously used . <p> Eventually , in 1980 leather casings were replaced with synthetic materials in times of poor weather conditions , including the new Gilbert ' Barbarian ' ball . However , all leather balls were later phased out . <p> In 1994 Gilbert first began using the coloured ' trims ' that have become so iconic in the sport of rugby . Their rugby balls have been used in every Rugby World Cup since 1995 . <p> Other businesses have also forayed into the rugby ball market with Adidas , Mitre and Webb Ellis all making headway in particular tournaments and competitions , but for many the Gilbert brand remains synonymous with rugby and rugby balls . <p> The humble rugby ball is just a small footnote in the glorious history of the sport , but its past really is fascinating . It will continue to change and to evolve , just as the game does , but it 's come an awfully long way since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heineken Rugby Club celebrates and rewards real supporters who make the game what it is.
