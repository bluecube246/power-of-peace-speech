Brendan - a lifetime of commitment to the cause

<h> Brendan - a lifetime of commitment to the cause <p> It intrigues when people outside the county wonder about the reasons why Kilkenny hurling is enjoying such a rich vein of success . <p> Many would present ideas as numerous as the colours in Joseph 's dream-coat . <p> But irrespective of the pontifications , the answer simply swirls around a couple of major issues . They are endemic in the old adage that reads " fail to prepare , prepare to fail " . <p> It really does come down to preparation of mind and body , and nobody addresses that idiom with a greater verve and concentration than Kilkenny . <p> The county has records , a super-star aura , a rich hurling history , legends and what have you . <p> The great Phil ' Fan ' Larkin would have you believe that there is no such thing as a bad Kilkenny hurler . Reference the life-span of most of us ; it is difficult not to agree with ' Fan ' . <p> It is not taxing either to present the whys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words about the imperious Liam ' Chunkey ' O'Brien , and how at Christmas time , most of his friends of five and six years of age were getting guns , holsters , lorries and trains as presents , while he always got the same present - a hurley and sliotar . <p> He spoke too of playing under the Railway bridge day and night on the O'Loughlin Road , and how the Insurance Agent , the iconic County Board secretary of the day , Paddy Grace would always have a sliotar for him when he passed along the road . <p> The game is in the DNA . <p> Take a stroll along Ormonde Street on any school lunch break , and have a look . Then tell me your impressions . <p> Students from the Christian Brothers and St Kieran 's College , many of them armed with hurleys tip-tapping a sliotar to each other , or pucking the same sliotar on to the walls of high buildings with tremendous accuracy and concentration . <p> In a game where failure to hit the third story walls is temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only be seen in a county like Kilkenny . <p> In very simple terms , these young men have been doing such practices at home , and in their clubs a million times over . <p> Recently I met with one of the modern-day development gurus - he will hate that description - who has been central to the development of under-age hurling in Kilkenny . It is Brendan O'Sullivan . <p> The popular ' Sully ' was begot , bred and welded in Thomastown lore . He attended primary school in the town . <p> Later when he qualified as a primary school teacher , the bus back to his native sod could n't travel fast enough . <p> You start talking to Brendan about hurling in Thomastown , and you have a tough job fining the full stop . And can he find that reverse gear in a heartbeat ? <p> Tell me about it dear reader ! <p> Before returning to his home patch , Brendan furthered his second level education in De La Salle in Waterford as a boarder . There he befriended two people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first was Liam Griffin , the former Clare and Wexford hurler , Wexford All-Ireland-winning manager , and one of Ireland 's leading hoteliers . The other was Ned Quinn , the Kilkenny GAA Boad chairman . <p> Brendan O'Sullivan cemented a friendship that continues to this day . <p> De La Salle were defeated in a Harty Cup final by ? rdscoil Ris , and an All-Ireland colleges football final by Belcamp College , for whom one Frank Cummins clattered home a superb goal . <p> Brendan conceded that the pursuit of education was often parked while a Leinster Railway Cup team was selected , or an Ireland team to play the Combined Universities got assigned much of the time that should have been allocated to the m ? dh cinnealach , or the Pythagoras Theorem . <p> " But we got there nonetheless , " he smiled philosophically . <p> We need to clutch and engage the rev gear . While in school with Peadar Laffin ( RIP ) and Tom Comer , Brendan hurled in numerous schools finals , winning a fist of them . Schools hurling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen schools championship on the bounce , with the much admired MrLaffin in charge . <p> " We lost the first one the year Mr Laffin passed away , " Brendan recalled . " I remember it was against Mooncoin . <p> " But there were great schools teams around at the time in place like St Patrick 's , Rower Inistioge , Mooncoin , Kilkenny CBS , Ballyhale and Jim Neary 's lads in Kilmanagh . <p> " That time it did n't matter what parish a lad came from , as long as he was on the roll call at the start of the year . The first win I had , we had Jim ' Boxer ' Walsh at centre -back . He is from Bennettsbridge , but he went to school in Thomastown . <p> " It was the same in every parish , " he reminded . <p> When Brendan finished playing he was already immersed in the hurling life of his own school . <p> " We had a great run of school wins during the early seventies , " he recalled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had tremendous youngsters there . <p> " We had Paudie Lannon , probably the most talented all-round sportsman this county has ever produced , and we had Dick O'Hara , John Costello , the Hoynes , the Walshes and others . <p> " As well as the hurling championships , we also won plenty of football championships too , with practically the same players . They were great times with great players . " <p> The Kilkenny Schools Board organisation , started by people like Tom Waldron , was the template many others copied . <p> " Certainly , " Brendan said when it was put to him . " Much of the heavy lifting in that regard was done by people like Tom . Then when we came home to take up our positions in our respective schools , most went in to join up with the Schools Board . <p> " Lads like Paul ( Kinsella ) , Jimmy Neary , John Knox ( Gowran teacher ) , Tommy Hayes , Dick O'Neill and others were young , ambitious and focussed on the core issue of the betterment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new innovative ideas that you initiated , which was the provision of hurling equipment to schools , and by definition children at a very affordable price , we suggested . <p> " Paul was the instigator of that , " Brendan revealed . " Families were finding life difficult , with low wage packets , or unemployment . Paul approached hurley makers in Kilkenny with a proposition to purchase good quality hurls for juveniles . <p> " There was no profit accruing to anyone . We let the hurleys off at what was paid for them . He also negotiated a price for helmets . <p> " They too were sold with no profit . To be fair to all the Kilkenny hurley makers , they extended a credit facility that you would get nowhere else . <p> " Bank interest rates at the time were over 17% , so normal credit was expensive . But the Kilkenny hurley makers were very understanding , and very decent . <p> " People like Ramie Dowling , Pat Delaney , Michael Brennan of Castle Hurleys were marvellous to us . They extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would eventually get paid . <p> " Paul was brilliant that way , and in many other elements of the schools operation . It was an organisation built on trust and friendship , where the chairmanship alternated on an annual basis . <p> " The secretary and treasurer never changed for 30 years , with Paul and John Knox in situ for all of that time . It was n't all about teachers either . <p> " We had great people involved like Billy Phelan from Mooncoin , Joe Quinn from Kilmacow and others . They worked away for the good of hurling in their own schools . <p> " We had a brilliant minder in Paddy Grace ( Co . Board secretary ) . Even when there was n't a bob in the County Board , Paddy always said there would be money found for schools hurling . He never , to his eternal credit reneged on that promise . " <p> How did you arrive at the County Board initially ? <p> " If I was honest , I would have to admit that I probably got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the marvellous Joe Walsh , secretary of the South Board ? He insisted that I run for the Leinster Council . <p> " I found out afterwards that my running guaranteed that another delegate would not win the election . So I really came in on the back of a little subterfuge , in-house politics , and some naivety . " <p> There were times Brendan , certainly when you attended County Board meetings , that you were on a kind of crusade which at times was very much viewed by the elder statesmen as arrogant and even disruptive ? <p> " Maybe so , " he said . " We were young , with some different ideas . I can see how we could have been seen thus , but it was a tough arena at meetings under the old stand . <p> Brendan remembered the chairman of the Leinster Council in his time , Tom Loftus . <p> " He was a far-seeing man , " he insisted . " I remember that there were five Leinster counties , including Kilkenny , who were absolutely broke . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years of grants to the counties in one offering , with the proviso that they would be returned whenever their circumstances allowed . <p> " He was a great man , as was the then young secretary called Michael Delaney . " <p> Again , we go back a little . Progressing to the under-16 grade , and then minor , Brendan O'Sullivan played with the celluloid star of the land , one Ollie Walsh , goalie supreme . <p> " Ollie was a hero to all , " he beamed at memories of the great one . " We looked up to him as if he was a God , and to many around Thomastown and further afield , he was . He was the original GAA pin-up star . <p> " He was a marvellous hurler , with flowing blonde hair , a tremendous sidestep . He was a terrific human being , who never lost his love , or never failed to announce that he was from Thomastown . As young lads we would go down to Grennan to watch him train . <p> " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the age ranks and found myself playing on the same team , it was pure exhilaration . <p> " Thomastown were asked to play in loads of tournaments , but it was Ollie that everyone wanted to see . Thousands would turn up to the games . Lads would be talking about the big crowds , but in honesty , if Ollie travelled alone there would still be the same numbers . <p> " He was admired , loved and enjoyed everywhere he went . He was a brilliant outfield hurler too . " <p> Brendan continued with the stories of his beloved Thomastown . He spoke of how they got to and lost the senior hurling final in 1967 , for instance . <p> " Fate and downright bad luck denied us our chance of senior glory , " he ventured . " We lost Tom ( Walsh ) because of that dreadful accident in the ' 67 All-Ireland final . He was a terrible loss . <p> " He had not even reached his prime . He was so dedicated that there is no doubt in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hurling . He was such a lovely fellow , and still is . <p> " We lost Ollie because of suspension after the National League final against Tipp the following year . I have no doubt , but that if both were available , we would have won . <p> " That setback had a deep effect on the hurling life of our town . It dealt a blow that took a long time to get over . The effect lingered too long in the minds and hearts of the staunch hurling people . <p> " For a very long time the scars were very raw , " he insisted . <p> Brendan played with the Thomastown seniors before he was 17 . He was sharing the same dressing room ( a skeough bush or the back of a parked van , if lucky ) with some of the greats of the day like Ollie , Tom ' Blonde ' Walsh , ' Cha ' Whelan , Dick Blanchfield and Dick Walsh . <p> He played on successive Kilkenny minor teams in 1964 and ' 65 . The former were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the All-Ireland in ' 65 , having beaten Kilkenny on the way . <p> He progressed to the under-21 team in ' 67 , again with limited success . Ironic then that the Thomastown man could n't buy an All-Ireland victory as a player , but could n't miss All-Irelands as a selector with the entire spread of county teams at all levels , except junior . <p> He even won two titles with the greatest camogie team the country has ever known in 1976 and again in ' 77 . <p> " They were an amazing team , " Brendan recalled . " I have been involved with many championship winning teams , and while they were all superb athletes , none of the team was better at what they did than those camogie players . <p> " They had very little support financially , although to be fair to Paddy Grace , he never saw them stuck . Ann Carroll and Bridie McGarry would drive from Dublin to Kilkenny to train on a Wednesday evening , pick up Liz Neary in whatever hospital she was in training to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was replicated on many nights and days through the campaigns . Then you had Biddy ( O'Sullivan ) coming up from Tullogher on a bone shaker of a Honda 50 . The Downeys , Fennelly , Kavanagh , Martin , Conway , O'Neills , Carey , Holden , Ryan and the rest knew no limits of the energy and dedication that was needed to win titles . <p> " I treasure every memory I shared with those girls - truly awesome . Amazing people to know and work with . " <p> Brendan was appointed Leinster Hurling Officer by the Leinster Council . His remit was all about improving the state , and standard , of the game in Leinster . <p> He spent many , many hours on the roads preaching the gospel . To this end , he elicited the help of his hurling friends in his native place to give a hand . <p> " The likes of Noel Skehan , Georgie Leahy , ' Fan ' Larkin and Tony Doran never failed to honour their word when asked to give a hand in other counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great friend of Georgie Leahy ? <p> " Of course , " he replied . " He is one of the most loyal , trustworthy , honourable , decent people that I have had the pleasure of working with . But you see , that is no State secret . <p> " There are literally thousands of people with whom Georgie has worked or helped who would say the same . Some would say it better . I am always honoured to say to people when they ask if I know him , that he is one of my greatest friends . " <p> On his time with the winning minor team of 1988 he offered : " They were a smashing bunch of young lads . They had great talent . Lads like D.J . ( Carey ) , Adrian Ronan , Pat O'Neill , Charlie ( Carter ) , John Conlon , Declan Roche , Jimmy Conroy , Patsy Brophy , Pat O'Grady were terrific , but the real engine room of that minor team was Briain Ryan . What a player . Brilliant ! " <p> Brendan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 83 . <p> " I 'm going to say something , and many will take exception , but it is an opinion of mine that the best Kilkenny team ever was the double-double winning team of that time , " he insisted . " They were magnificent players with a ferocious will to win . <p> " We had Pat ( Henderson ) as our manager , and the rest of us did n't really matter . He never believed in this shouting and roaring , or breaking tables with hurleys . <p> " He established a trust in the players , and they responded . Look at the players he had , and tell me that Kilkenny have produced better ? " <p> I can hear the arguments starting . Give the man credit for courage and honestly held conviction . <p> Back to the goal by Frank Cummins which denied De La Salle the All-Ireland football title . <p> " I remember one evening at training ' threatening ' Frank Cummins with dropping him because he beat us with that fantastic goal , " he said as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't that brave , but we often had a good laugh about it . " <p> Name one major change in the game that you have noticed over the years , we urged . <p> " I 'll give you two , " he answered . " I think the fun has gone out of the game , but particularly at the younger age levels . It has become too serious too early for the youngsters . <p> " Now they are pumping iron , following dietary specialists and specialised programmes . There is something very wrong with that progression . <p> " It is still about enjoyment . It is still about friendships . It is about being a part of something enjoyable . If it is supposedly about enjoyment , how do I hear terminology like hard work being used ? <p> " The second element I worry about is that the core element is slowly but surely being eroded by a lack of acknowledgement and encouragement . <p> " How often do you hear the words ' grass roots ' mentioned ? <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' being manured with any worthwhile significant growth hormones ? " <p> I asked one final question ! Why is Kilkenny so far ahead of others in many elements ? <p> " We have great people making telling contributions to every element of the GAA in the county , " he insisted . " At club level , at schools level , at development level , at administration level , at Supporters Club level . They are tremendous . <p> " Take , for instance , the development of Nowlan Park . Is there a better , more appropriate stadium in any code in the country ? <p> " They do n't all have to be as big as Croke Park or Thurles . Look at the achievement in Dunmore ? <p> " Take a simple matter like the Yearbook that a few of you are involved with . Nobody does a better job . It meets the need to publicise a yearly record of our activities . <p> " The Kilkenny system is a long way removed from a castle built on sand . Everyone has bought into the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even supporters - there are plenty of acolytes ready and willing to take up the mantle . <p> If you wish , you can contact us using any of the methods below : Kilkenny People , High Street , KilkennyEmail : **33;38;TOOLONG : 056 7791000 <p> This website and its associated newspaper are full participating members of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman .
