Bank of Ireland claims firms connected to Blake and Bruce O'Donnell may get as much as ? 6 million ( ? 7.6m ) from the sale of Columbus Courtyard , Canary Wharf , after substantial debts on the building , valued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ireland claims . <p> The bank , which is pursuing Brian and Mary Patricia O'Donell for repayment of a judgment of some ? 70million , obtained temporary orders last Friday preventing dissipation of any monies received from the sale by Blake and Bruce and three British Virgin Island ( BVI ) registered companies . <p> The bank said it feared residual sale proceeds could go to the companies as part of an alleged fraudulent scheme by the parents , who are bankrupt and would not be entitled to deal in the assets , to put monies beyond the reach of the bank . <p> Blake O'Donnell has described the bank 's claims as " scurrilous " . <h> Temporary injunction <p> The bank wants the Columbus Courtyard sale to proceed , as do the O'Donnells and the court-appointed official administering the bankruptcy , the court heard on Wednesday . <p> The bank previously got undertakings from Blake and Bruce in 2012 not to deal in the BVI assets . <p> It says , when it learned last week the sale of Columbus Courtyard was imminent , it obtained ex parte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BVI companies and Blake and Bruce dissipating any sale proceeds . It took separate proceedings in the BVI on the same day . <p> When the matter returned before Mr Justice John Hedigan on Wednesday , Blake O'Donnell complained , on behalf of himself and his brother , they had received only an order made by the BVI Supreme Court but none of the details of what the bank based its case on . <p> The order sought by the bank in the BVI was " a backdoor way " of getting a receiver appointed over the companies and was inappropriate , he said . <p> He did not understand why the 2012 undertakings given by his brother and himself were not enough , Mr O'Donnell added . The bank could simply have asked the brothers to agree to continue them . <p> The bank was trying to damage their reputations , he said . Despite bankrupting his parents , the bank was still pursuing them and pursuing him and his brother though " a derivative action " , he added . <p> The bank 's actions in seeking these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus Courtyard in excess of Stg ? ? 100m , he also said . <h> Full determination <p> Cian Ferriter SC , for the bank , said it had met the tests for securing an injunction pending full determination of the matter . <p> The judge said that what happened in the BVI was not really relevant to the bank 's application to continue the orders ontained here on Friday . He believed the orders being sought were essentially the same as the undertakings previously given by the brothers and would grant them pending a full hearing . <p> He did not see how these proceedings could have any affect on the sale of the property , the judge added .
