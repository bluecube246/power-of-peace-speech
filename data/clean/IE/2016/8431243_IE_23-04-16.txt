<h> Gaoth Dobhair set the pace in All County League Div 1 <h> ANOTHER BUSY PROGRAMME OF FIXTURES THIS WEEKEND <p> Gaoth Dobhair are the early pace-setters in the AllSportStore.com Division One of the Donegal All County Football League after four rounds of games . <p> They are followed closely by Kilcar and St Eunan 's who are level on points , and one ahead of Naomh Conaill , who have a game less played . <p> Of the top four , Kilcar who are managed by Martin McHugh this season , are the only team to lose a game . . <p> Even at this early stage it is difficult to look past the leading four for the league title . Last year 's champions St Michael 's lost their opening game , but have won their last two and received a big boost with the return to action last weekend of Colm McFadden . <p> However , the word around the Bridge is that the championship is the main focus this season . <p> The other big story so far is the form of Glenswilly who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaoth Dobhair will expect to bag two more points this weekend when they host great rivals , Dungloe , in Magheragallon . <p> Time was this fixture took on a life of its own and it was easier to pick the six numbers in the Lotto than choose the winner of a Gaoth Dobhair , Dungloe game . <p> But with county seniors Neil and Eamon McGee , Odhran MacNiallais , Ciaran Gillespie and Michael Carroll in their line-up , Gaoth Dobhair simply have too much power for an injury-struck Dungloe . <p> Without Noel McBride , Cory Gallagher , both injured and Martin Redmond currently soccer tied with Home Farm , Dungloe are going to have to play out of their skins to take anything from this tie . <p> St Eunan 's are showing good early season form under new manager David McGinley and with Rory Kavanagh , looking lean and fit and with veteran John Haran playing as well as ever they should have a little too much power and pace for St Michael 's , especially on the wide open spaces of O'Donnell Park . <p> Naomh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intermediate champions , Realt Na Mara , Bundoran expect to be back to full strength after fielding a shadow team last weekend against St Michael 's . <p> If there is to be a surprise result this weekend , Realt Na Mara might just pull it off , but Leo McLoone , Dermot ' Brick ' Molloy and Anthony Thompson should power Naomh Conaill to victory . <p> Former playing mates Martin McHugh and Seamus Gallagher go head to head for the first time when Kilcar host Ardara , in Towney , with McHugh expected to be holding the bragging rights at the final whistle . <p> Termon host Glenswilly , in what promises to be tasty encounter at the Burn Road . Termon have one win from their three outings . They also ran Gaoth Dobhair to a point at the Burn Road and with this kind of form they should have the edge against Glenswilly , who are still chasing their first points after four defeats . The outcome may very well hinge on the availability of Michael Murphy and Neil Gallagher . <p> Other divisions <p> In Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Cloughaneely should have the measure on home soil of Four Masters , Milford , St Nauls , Naomh Columba , and Cloughaneely respectively . <p> This website and its associated newspaper are full participating members of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman .
