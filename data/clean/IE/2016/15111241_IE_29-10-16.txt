<p> On Tuesday , Fabricio Werdum decided to make his feelings about the UFC 's exclusive apparel deal with sports clothing giant Reebok known to the world . <p> Werdum posted a picture of himself wearing a UFC t-shirt to Instagram , but it had been photoshopped so that the Reebok logo was replaced by the famous Nike tick on the front of the garment . Alongside the shot , the former UFC heavyweight champion had written " N ? o sou gen ? rico , sou @nike desde criancinha ! " , which translates to " I 'm not generic , I 'm Nike since childhood ! " <p> On Facebook later that day , the Brazilian revealed that his post represented a protest of sorts . <p> " We used to get real good money , it was a lot different from Reebok , " said Werdum , who claimed that he was able to accumulate six-figure sums from sponsorship deals for every fight before the Reebok era began . " Today , with Reebok there is a pay scale , if you have a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it 's good money , but nothing like it was before , so of course it was a protest ( via MMAFighting ) . " <p> For his last octagon appearance , Werdum 's athlete outfitting payout was $10,000 ( via MMAJunkie ) . <p> Werdum urged other fighters to speak out against the Reebok deal as well , assuring them that they would not be punished for doing so . <p> It seems that Werdum has been punished however . The Kings MMA representative , who faces Cain Velasquez in a highly-anticipated rematch at UFC 207 in Las Vegas on December 30th , revealed through another Instagram post on Friday that he will no longer be a part of the UFC 's Spanish language broadcast team . Werdum claimed that his removal was a direct response from the promotion to his rebellious social media activity . <p> It 's difficult to predict whether these events will encourage or discourage Werdum 's peers from following his lead . The fact that he was punished could give those who were considering a protest of their own pause for thought , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UFC 's treatment of a former champion in some quarters . <p> Werdum last saw action at UFC 203 in September , when he scored a unanimous decision victory over Travis Browne . Just four months prior to that win , the 39-year-old veteran lost the heavyweight title when he was knocked out inside a round by Stipe Miocic at UFC 198 in Curitiba , Brazil .
