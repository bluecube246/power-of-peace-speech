A family affair as TDs pick siblings to ' guard patch ' in Cork County Council  Six councillors triumphed in the general election and had to vacate their council seats . However , three of them will have close relatives watching their home patches while they are in Dublin .  Two political dynasties have their bloodline continued in County Hall , in particular the Moynihan clan from Ballyvourney . Aindrias Moynihan ( FF ) won a seat in Cork North West and he is replaced on the council by his sister , Gobnait .  The social care worker was heavily involved in her brother 's election campaign and previously campaigned for her father , Donal , who won several terms in the D ? il . If Gobnait , or any other member of the Moynihan clan , manages a few more years on the council they will set a remarkable 100 years of unbroken service by the family on the local authority .  Another Fianna F ? il political dynasty has ensured it will keep a presence on the local authority for higher house -- representing Cork East -- has paved the way for his sister , Deirdre O'Brien , to take over in County Hall , just as Kevin did when his father , Ned , was elected to the D ? il in the early 1980s . She works for Laya Healthcare in Little Island .  A third co-option might signal the start of a new political dynasty . It 's been a meteoric rise for Michael Collins ( Ind ) , who was only elected to the council in 2014 and now finds himself in the D ? il as a TD for the Cork South-West constituency . His brother , Danny , 40 , who replaces him , runs the Boston Bar in Bantry .  Margaret Murphy-O'Mahony ( FF ) , who was also elected in the same constituency , is being replaced by Gillian Coughlan , who lost the nomination race against her to contest the general election . A former Bandon town councillor , Gillian teaches at Col ? iste an Phairsaigh , Glanmire .  Sinn F ? in got two councillors into the Buckley . The former is replaced by Eoghan Jeffers , 27 , who lost his job as a mechanic during the recession . Danielle Twomey , a part-time student in CIT , takes up the latter 's seat .
