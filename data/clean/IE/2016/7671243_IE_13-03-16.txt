has a middleweight fighter just revealed the bumper card for ufc 200 ?  ufc 200 is getting closer and closer , and speculation mounts as to what fights will headline the card . regardless of what happens , it is going to be a massive line-up , and will probably be the promotion 's biggest ever event .  we do n't know much about the card so far , other than the fact that it will take place at the new t-mobile arena in las vegas on july 9 , and that conor mcgregor will be fighting at it , after dana white confirmed this news .  however , the number 6 ranked middleweight fighter tim kennedy has posted a photo to his instagram claiming that event will play host to some gargantuan bouts , including his fight with anderson silva . silva recently lost to michael bisping in london , a fighter kennedy defeated two years ago .  conor mcgregor is expected to defend his featherweight title at the bout , but the only thing up in the air is whether he suggests that ' the answer ' will get his tilt , while aldo faces max holloway , in a fight which one would assume the winner will be given the next title shot .  the other bout which would garner huge interest would be georges st-pierre 's return to the octagon to face mcgregor 's conquerer , nate diaz . gsp has not fought since 2013 , defeating johny hendricks and nate 's older brother nick diaz in his last two fights .  this card is far from confirmed , and it is merely doing the rounds on social media .
