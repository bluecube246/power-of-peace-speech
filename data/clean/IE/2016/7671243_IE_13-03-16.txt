Has A Middleweight Fighter Just Revealed The Bumper Card For UFC 200 ?  UFC 200 is getting closer and closer , and speculation mounts as to what fights will headline the card . Regardless of what happens , it is going to be a massive line-up , and will probably be the promotion 's biggest ever event .  We do n't know much about the card so far , other than the fact that it will take place at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on July 9 , and that Conor McGregor will be fighting at it , after Dana White confirmed this news .  However , the number 6 ranked middleweight fighter Tim Kennedy has posted a photo to his Instagram claiming that event will play host to some gargantuan bouts , including his fight with Anderson Silva . Silva recently lost to Michael Bisping in London , a fighter Kennedy defeated two years ago .  Conor McGregor is expected to defend his featherweight title at the bout , but the only thing up in the air is whether he suggests that ' The Answer ' will get his tilt , while Aldo faces Max Holloway , in a fight which one would assume the winner will be given the next title shot .  The other bout which would garner huge interest would be Georges St-Pierre 's return to the octagon to face McGregor 's conquerer , Nate Diaz . GSP has not fought since 2013 , defeating Johny Hendricks and Nate 's older brother Nick Diaz in his last two fights .  This card is far from confirmed , and it is merely doing the rounds on social media .
