Matteo Darmian is starting in place of the Ecuador international , who joins fellow defenders Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling on the sidelines through injury .  " They were the three players that start almost every match in the Premier League and now we lose all three in the same period , " manager Jose Mourinho told broadcasters .  " But that 's football and it 's an opportunity for others to play . We trust Darmian and we trust Marcos Rojo to have a positive influence . "  Attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan was among the other notable absentees from the United squad on Saturday .  Much was expected of the 27-year-old following his summer arrival from Borussia Dortmund , yet his playing time has been restricted .  While a thigh injury played a part , Mkhitaryan 's return to fitness has not brought with it a recall to the squad and that absence continued when Burnley arrived on Saturday .  Mourinho said on the eve of the match that the player was taking time to get used to Premier League has suggested the player is puzzled by his exclusion .  " I can not know what the Manchester United manager is thinking about , " Hayrapetyan said , according to Armenpress .  " I have talked with Mkhitaryan . He also does n't know what Jose Mourinho is thinking .  " Mkhitaryan trains and is in good shape , but no-one knows the reasons . "
