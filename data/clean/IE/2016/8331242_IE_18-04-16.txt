21 things you 'll hear during every episode of dragons den  it 's a brilliant programme that combines two of my favourite things : desperation and money . i wish more television shows were like dragons den . imagine if the x factor judges had wads of cash on the desk in front of them during auditions . beggars belief !  the dragons are stern but fair , meaning the people looking for investments are generally quivering with nerves . all it takes is a free sample to have those dragons warming to them like a rabbit to a balloon .  1 . it 's a family run business , i 've always had a passion for shoelaces , from a very young age it was all i could think about .  2 . i 'm looking for ? 1.6m for 5% of the business . i think it 's a fair margin and i 'm not willing to negotiate .  3 . what i 've got here is a product that can and will change life as we know it : ) .  4 . i want a dragon with the expertise and market knowledge to help me bring my waterproof sponges all the way to the top .  5 . there is a patent pending for the last 37 years so we 're hopeful that it will come through in the next few months , please god .  6 . i 'm going to make you an offer of ? 12 but in return , i want 90% of your company . do we have a deal ?  7 . these multicoloured dishwasher tablets have a very special place in my heart . when i was younger , i ate a dishwasher tablet and was excreting bubbles for days . i told my mam we should have multicoloured tablets so if it happened again , i would have rainbow farts .  8 . sorry to cut across you michael , but who 's annette profit ?  9 . now i know nothing about technology , so explain this to me as if you were talking to a child . a multimillionaire child .  advertisement plasters out there and if you guys ca n't see it , maybe i 've brought my million euro idea to the wrong place .  11 . this is a massive opportunity and i 'm happy to welcome any questions that the dragons might have .  12 . at what point will we get to see some actual dragons ?  13 . i like to think of myself as a young bill cullen .  14 . my projected profit for year three is ? 10b and i am confident we will get there .  15 . i 'd like to take a minute to have a think about this if it 's ok ? *walks over to wall and bangs head against it repeatedly until the producer forces him to stop*  16 . i 've a lot of interest from all the big supermarkets so to be honest , i 'm just here to be on the telly .  17 . hi paul , my name is gavin . " hi gavin , i know " .  18 . it 's a special it 's like nothing you 've ever seen before .  19 . i tweeted a picture of this product to paul walker before he died and he said it looked cool . if you refuse to make me an offer , you are doing his memory a disservice .  20 . please , i need this . my family are starving . i 've put all of our money into these glow-in-the-dark yo-yos and if i return home without so much as a tenner i am dead meat .  21 . i 've never seen the need for one justin bieber , so the idea of a second one just is n't for me . it is for this reason , i 'm out .
