<p> Baby Lynlee Boemer was born 12 weeks after doctors temporarily removed her from her mother 's uterus to operate on a life-threatening tumour , sacrococcygeal teratoma . The tumour , which was the same size as the foetus , was competing for the her mother 's blood flow which compromised the child 's growth and chance of survival . <p> The growth on the foetus ' tailbone was identified during a routine ultrasound , 16 weeks into her mother Margaret 's pregnancy . The tumour was targeted in a five hour surgery in Texas Children 's Foetal Centre , which saw 1lb Lynlee removed from the womb before being returned . Twelve weeks later , the child was delivered via Caesarean section on June 6 . <p> Speaking to CNN , mum Margaret from Plano , Texas said : " Lynlee did n't have much of a chance . At 23 weeks , the tumour was shutting her heart down and causing her to go into cardiac failure , so it was a choice of allowing the tumour to take over her body or giving her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision for us : We wanted to give her life , " said Margaret . <p> Eight days after Lynlee 's arrival , the baby underwent further surgery to remove further fragments of the tumour , which had been missed during the initial surgery , but has since made a full recovery . <p> " It was her second birth basically , " said Margaret . <p> " It was a relief to finally see her and to see that she had made it through after the open foetal surgery her heart had time to heal while I was still pregnant with her so she has no heart issues now and is just doing amazing .
