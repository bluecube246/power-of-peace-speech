<h> David Gibney writes that if you scrap the USC , the revenue must be found elsewhere or we will face deteriorated public services . <p> And the reason why is because people know it 's one of the fairest and most progressive taxes in Ireland and could go a long way to solving our housing , education and healthcare crisis . <p> Ahead of last year 's Budget , an Irish Times MRBI Poll asked the question : How should the Government spend the promised ? 1.5bn in the budget ? <p> 27% answered saying investment in healthcare -- including the hiring of nurses and doctors . <p> A further 31% said they wanted the government to scrap water charges , increase funding for education , increase social welfare , increase the state pension , invest in childcare , invest in back-to-work schemes and create employment and invest in roads . <p> 12% said they wanted investment in housing . <p> Only 8% said they wanted to cut or scrap the USC . <p> Despite this , the government cut USC and did n't sufficiently invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare crisis this year . <p> Last week , ahead of Budget 2017 -- where the USC was cut by 0.5% across the three lowest bands -- another MRBI poll revealed that only 10% wanted a cut in the USC , whereas 72% prioritise higher spending on public services , particularly health care . <p> So why all the talk of cutting USC ? <p> The USC raises ? 4 billion in revenue every year and is the most progressive income tax -- meaning the higher your income , the more you pay . <p> It is so progressive that 75% of the USC raised ( ? 3bn ) comes from the top 20% of earners and 43% comes from those earning more than ? 100,000 . <p> The simple fact of the matter is , if you scrap the USC then that revenue must be found elsewhere or we will all face deteriorated public services . <p> Documents recently drawn up by the Department of Finance for the Irish Government explained options available for the replacement of the USC : <p> Increased take on property and capital taxes , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increasing stamp duty on shares <p> An increase in indirect taxes including VAT and excise on petrol and diesel ( by ? 0.18 per litre ) , and beer ( by ? 1.50 per pint ) <p> The USC is a progressive tax , therefore abolition of , or substantial reductions in the USC would be regressive . For example if the USC were abolished a person on minimum wage would benefit by ? 316 , whereas an employee earning ? 150,000 would benefit by over ? 9,500 . <p> The reason for such a high contribution from high earners is because the USC has very few tax avoidance loopholes for the wealthy to exploit , unlike income tax . Low paid workers can not avail of income tax loopholes because many of them do not earn enough to pay tax in the first place . <p> Furthermore , the list of representative bodies opposed to tax cuts is growing . The Irish Congress of Trade Unions ( ICTU ) has opposed a cut in the USC , as has employers ' group IBEC . <p> Also , in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has publicly warned of the dangers of tax cuts at a time of economic growth , where there are rising levels of personal consumption and retail sales combined with an acceleration in employment growth : <p> " This suggests that economic activity does not need to be further stimulated by reducing personal taxation levels . " <p> Squeezed middle <p> So why is it the narrative that we should cut the USC ? Well , abolishing the USC would benefit the highest earners most who tend to have louder voices than low income households or the actual ' squeezed middle ' . <p> For instance , abolishing the USC would mean a substantial increase in take home pay for many people who do not depend on public services : <p> A TD would benefit by ? 4,523 ; <p> A government Minister by ? 10,145 ; <p> The Taoiseach would benefit by ? 12,370 ; <p> RTE 's highest paid presenter , Ryan Tubridy , would benefit by ? 37,142 ; <p> Richie Boucher -- CEO of Bank of Ireland -- would benefit by ? 64,982 : <p> Meanwhile , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' benefit ' by ? 668 . <p> The cuts to the USC in Budget 2017 will mean a net benefit to a worker on ? 70,000 of ? 353 , whereas a retail worker on ? 25,000 per year will only benefit by one third of that figure -- ? 128 . <p> Combined with the cuts to USC last year , a worker on ? 70,000 is now ? 1,255 better off , whereas someone earning ? 25,000 is only ? 355 better off . <p> However , it is the retail worker who can not afford private healthcare , private pensions and private housing options . To illustrate this point further , the USC allows the State to hire two nurses based on Richie Boucher 's contribution alone . Without those nurses , low-paid workers would no doubt receive reduced care levels while relying on public health services . <p> What should be done with the USC ? <p> Fine Gael Minister for Public Expenditure Pascal O Donohue(R) with Minister for Finance Michael Noonan at the final press conference about the Budget Source : RollingNews.ie <p> In terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sense to continue the USC but the income from it should be ring-fenced to provide better vital public services in health , education , housing , transport and also social security . <p> Rather than scrap the USC , as has been proposed by Fine Gael , over the next five years , the USC 's ? 4 billion in revenue could be invested to do all of these : <p> Initiate a public housing programme and build an extra 6,000 homes per year for the next five years ( ? 1bn approximately ) . <p> Increase funding for water services by ? 500m allowing the scrapping of domestic water charges which was set to raise only ? 271m per year . <p> Increase funding for the public healthcare system by ? 1 billion which could help to eliminate waiting lists and save lives . <p> Increase funding for education by ? 1bn which would allow us to reduce our class sizes from the highest in the EU with 25 pupils per teacher , to a target of the EU average of 20 . <p> The remaining revenue could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport , among other areas in dire need of investment . <p> So the question for us all is , what type of society do we want to live in ? <p> One where we cut taxes that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest in our society at the expense of those who rely on public services and social protection ? Or one where we ask the richest to contribute that little bit more so that we can protect the most vulnerable and have decent public services ? <p> David Gibney is communications officer with Mandate Trade Union and a Right2Water coordinator . <p> TheJournal.ie is a full participating member of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman .
