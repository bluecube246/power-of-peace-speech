david gibney writes that if you scrap the usc , the revenue must be found elsewhere or we will face deteriorated public services .  and the reason why is because people know it 's one of the fairest and most progressive taxes in ireland and could go a long way to solving our housing , education and healthcare crisis .  ahead of last year 's budget , an irish times mrbi poll asked the question : how should the government spend the promised ? 1.5bn in the budget ?  27% answered saying investment in healthcare -- including the hiring of nurses and doctors .  a further 31% said they wanted the government to scrap water charges , increase funding for education , increase social welfare , increase the state pension , invest in childcare , invest in back-to-work schemes and create employment and invest in roads .  12% said they wanted investment in housing .  only 8% said they wanted to cut or scrap the usc .  despite this , the government cut usc and did n't sufficiently invest in healthcare crisis this year .  last week , ahead of budget 2017 -- where the usc was cut by 0.5% across the three lowest bands -- another mrbi poll revealed that only 10% wanted a cut in the usc , whereas 72% prioritise higher spending on public services , particularly health care .  so why all the talk of cutting usc ?  the usc raises ? 4 billion in revenue every year and is the most progressive income tax -- meaning the higher your income , the more you pay .  it is so progressive that 75% of the usc raised ( ? 3bn ) comes from the top 20% of earners and 43% comes from those earning more than ? 100,000 .  the simple fact of the matter is , if you scrap the usc then that revenue must be found elsewhere or we will all face deteriorated public services .  documents recently drawn up by the department of finance for the irish government explained options available for the replacement of the usc :  increased take on property and capital taxes , including and increasing stamp duty on shares  an increase in indirect taxes including vat and excise on petrol and diesel ( by ? 0.18 per litre ) , and beer ( by ? 1.50 per pint )  the usc is a progressive tax , therefore abolition of , or substantial reductions in the usc would be regressive . for example if the usc were abolished a person on minimum wage would benefit by ? 316 , whereas an employee earning ? 150,000 would benefit by over ? 9,500 .  the reason for such a high contribution from high earners is because the usc has very few tax avoidance loopholes for the wealthy to exploit , unlike income tax . low paid workers can not avail of income tax loopholes because many of them do not earn enough to pay tax in the first place .  furthermore , the list of representative bodies opposed to tax cuts is growing . the irish congress of trade unions ( ictu ) has opposed a cut in the usc , as has employers ' group ibec .  also , in recent has publicly warned of the dangers of tax cuts at a time of economic growth , where there are rising levels of personal consumption and retail sales combined with an acceleration in employment growth :  " this suggests that economic activity does not need to be further stimulated by reducing personal taxation levels . "  squeezed middle  so why is it the narrative that we should cut the usc ? well , abolishing the usc would benefit the highest earners most who tend to have louder voices than low income households or the actual ' squeezed middle ' .  for instance , abolishing the usc would mean a substantial increase in take home pay for many people who do not depend on public services :  a td would benefit by ? 4,523 ;  a government minister by ? 10,145 ;  the taoiseach would benefit by ? 12,370 ;  rte 's highest paid presenter , ryan tubridy , would benefit by ? 37,142 ;  richie boucher -- ceo of bank of ireland -- would benefit by ? 64,982 :  meanwhile , an ' benefit ' by ? 668 .  the cuts to the usc in budget 2017 will mean a net benefit to a worker on ? 70,000 of ? 353 , whereas a retail worker on ? 25,000 per year will only benefit by one third of that figure -- ? 128 .  combined with the cuts to usc last year , a worker on ? 70,000 is now ? 1,255 better off , whereas someone earning ? 25,000 is only ? 355 better off .  however , it is the retail worker who can not afford private healthcare , private pensions and private housing options . to illustrate this point further , the usc allows the state to hire two nurses based on richie boucher 's contribution alone . without those nurses , low-paid workers would no doubt receive reduced care levels while relying on public health services .  what should be done with the usc ?  fine gael minister for public expenditure pascal o donohue(r) with minister for finance michael noonan at the final press conference about the budget source : rollingnews.ie  in terms makes sense to continue the usc but the income from it should be ring-fenced to provide better vital public services in health , education , housing , transport and also social security .  rather than scrap the usc , as has been proposed by fine gael , over the next five years , the usc 's ? 4 billion in revenue could be invested to do all of these :  initiate a public housing programme and build an extra 6,000 homes per year for the next five years ( ? 1bn approximately ) .  increase funding for water services by ? 500m allowing the scrapping of domestic water charges which was set to raise only ? 271m per year .  increase funding for the public healthcare system by ? 1 billion which could help to eliminate waiting lists and save lives .  increase funding for education by ? 1bn which would allow us to reduce our class sizes from the highest in the eu with 25 pupils per teacher , to a target of the eu average of 20 .  the remaining revenue could be transport , among other areas in dire need of investment .  so the question for us all is , what type of society do we want to live in ?  one where we cut taxes that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest in our society at the expense of those who rely on public services and social protection ? or one where we ask the richest to contribute that little bit more so that we can protect the most vulnerable and have decent public services ?  david gibney is communications officer with mandate trade union and a right2water coordinator .  thejournal.ie is a full participating member of the press council of ireland and supports the office of the press ombudsman . this scheme in addition to defending the freedom of the press , offers readers a quick , fair and free method of dealing with complaints that they may have in relation to articles that appear on our pages . to contact the office of the press ombudsman lo-call 1890 208 080 or go to www.pressombudsman.ie or www.presscouncil.ie  please note that thejournal.ie uses cookies to improve your information on cookies please refer to our cookies policy .  journal media does not control and is not responsible for user created content , posts , comments , submissions or preferences . users are reminded that they are fully responsible for their own created content and their own posts , comments and submissions and fully and effectively warrant and indemnify journal media in relation to such content and their ability to make such content , posts , comments and submissions available . journal media does not control and is not responsible for the content of external websites.
