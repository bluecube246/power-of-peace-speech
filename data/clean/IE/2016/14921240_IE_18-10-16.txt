Respect not ' name calling ' is required on abortion issue  Dear Editor , I appreciate Dr Ruairi Hanley 's opinion , and indeed applaud his call to action on all sides of the debate regarding the repeal of the 8th Amendment , as espoused in his recent article in the IMT ( ' Why every life counts ' , September 30 , 2016 ) .  However , I object to his use of the term ' pro-abortion activists ' . There are few , if any , ' pro-abortion ' activists . All that is sought is constitutionally protected bodily autonomy for the rather than pro-abortion .  Would n't it be wonderful if we lived in a place and time where women did n't want or need abortions ? But we do . And these women are travelling in great numbers to the UK and elsewhere to have them . Sometimes alone , sometimes frightened , sometimes at great expense , but always illegally . We need to stop the name-calling and have a respectful debate that recognises the reality of the situation in Ireland .
