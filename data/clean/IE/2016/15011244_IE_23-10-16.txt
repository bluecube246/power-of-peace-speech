this is what jose mourinho reportedly told antonio conte at the final whistle  the world saw jose mourinho yank antonio conte in for a few short , sharp words after his manchester united side were thumped 4-0 by chelsea .  jose mourinho returned to stamford bridge and was serenaded with ' you 're not the special one ' for most of the afternoon as he witnessed his new side implode against the team he could not control last season .  chelsea mauled united from start to finish and players like chris smalling , daley blind and jesse lingard will not relish the video reviews .  gary neville called some of united 's efforts to repel chelsea as ' absolute garbage defending ' and that was being kind .  the travelling united support did their best to rally and back their team despite their woeful display on the pitch . in return , conte was seen urging the chelsea fans to match the away section in terms of passion and singing .  that , it seems , is what riled mourinho and  mourinho was asked about the conversation on sky sports , after the game and initially attempted to brush off the question . asked by geoff shreeves if he was happy with conte 's tub-thumping actions , mourinho replied :  " of course not . that chat was between antonio and myself . "  this was a home-coming to forget but we do n't suspect mourinho will forget , or forgive , this one in a hurry .
