<h> This is what Jose Mourinho reportedly told Antonio Conte at the final whistle <h> The world saw Jose Mourinho yank Antonio Conte in for a few short , sharp words after his Manchester United side were thumped 4-0 by Chelsea . <p> Jose Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge and was serenaded with ' You 're not the Special One ' for most of the afternoon as he witnessed his new side implode against the team he could not control last season . <p> Chelsea mauled United from start to finish and players like Chris Smalling , Daley Blind and Jesse Lingard will not relish the video reviews . <p> Gary Neville called some of United 's efforts to repel Chelsea as ' absolute garbage defending ' and that was being kind . <p> The travelling United support did their best to rally and back their team despite their woeful display on the pitch . In return , Conte was seen urging the Chelsea fans to match the away section in terms of passion and singing . <p> That , it seems , is what riled Mourinho and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mourinho was asked about the conversation on Sky Sports , after the game and initially attempted to brush off the question . Asked by Geoff Shreeves if he was happy with Conte 's tub-thumping actions , Mourinho replied : <p> " Of course not . That chat was between Antonio and myself . " <p> This was a home-coming to forget but we do n't suspect Mourinho will forget , or forgive , this one in a hurry .
