Brock Lesnar made a triumphant return to the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the early hours of Sunday morning as he defeated Australian heavyweight Mark Hunt by unanimous decision , but it proved to be a different Lesnar to the one who dominated MMA during his title reign .  Lesnar looked tentative on his by serious health issues when he was diagnosed with the intestinal condition diverticulitis , resulting in 12 inches of his colon being removed .  Having been a keen trash talker and one to speak his mind during his first stint in the UFC , Lesnar cut a much calmer figure , displayed by his respect for Hunt in touching gloves at the start of each round and embracing him despite doing his best to split his head wide open with a barrage of thudding right hands late in the third round .  Yet it was his comments after the fight that proved to be the biggest sign of his change in attitude , as he took the opportunity of his in-ring interview with the UFC 's Joe Rogan to pay tribute to the five policeman shot in Dallas earlier in the week .  " It took me a little while to get out here , " Lesnar said after the victory . " Words ca n't describe this , thank you everybody , so much .  " I 'm taking it One day at a time . do want to do , America , a shout out for all the men that protect the country , from sea to sea , from one white boy to all nationalities , we 've got to stick together . "  The harrowing scenes in Dallas on Thursday night saw four gunmen armed with sniper rifles and other firearms kill 11 police officers and injure six more in a choreographed attack during a Black Lives Matter " parade . The UFC held a moment 's silence before the start of UFC 200 in memory of those who died in the attack .
