"  More than 300 were injured in the attack , many seriously , after a device was detonated near children 's rides while families celebrated Easter .

British prime minister David Cameron , who used his Easter message to urge Britons of all faiths to stand up for Christian values , said the attack shocked him .

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said : " My thoughts are with the victims and the family of the victims of the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has spoken out against the " fear and distrust " spread by the recent wave of terror attacks -- and called for love and empathy to combat them .

"  At least 70 people were killed when a Taliban splinter group detonated a bomb in Lahore , Pakistan , on Easter Sunday .
