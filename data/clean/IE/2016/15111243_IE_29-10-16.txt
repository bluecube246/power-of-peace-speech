<p> Arsenal took on Sunderland at the Stadium of Light knowing that a point would see them return , temporarily at least , to the top of the Premier League table . <p> Sunderland , for their part , were looking to avoid the ignominy of having the worse record after ten games than any side in Premier League history . <p> Once the visitors took the lead after 20 minutes , courtesy of Alexis S ? nchez after a fine team move , this game was becoming a procession for Arsenal . <p> However , such is the danger of a tight lead , Sunderland equalised just after the hour mark through a Jermain Defoe penalty after Petr Cech brought Duncan Watmore down in the box . <p> Arsenal restored their lead several minutes later as substitute Olivier Giroud scored with his first touch of the game , and by God did the floodgates open then . Giroud added his second from another header on the 76th minute , before Alexis doubled his own tally less than two minutes later after some shocking Sunderland defending . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble while Arsenal go top once more . <p> Sunderland Player Ratings : <p> Jordan Pickford -- 4 : Started well , but his confidence eroded throughout the match and then the mistakes started happening . <p> Billy Jones -- 4.5 : Might as well have stayed in the dressing room at half time . Jones was lucky that Iwobi was having an off-day , bur Gibbs punished him at every opportunity . <p> Lamine Kon ? -- 4 : Lost Alexis for the goal , got away with a foul on the forward in the box right before the equaliser . Pathetic performance . <p> John O'Shea -- 5 : Withdrawn through injury before half time , sparing him the headache of dealing with Arsenal 's pacey attack in the second half . <p> Patrick van Aanholt -- 4.5 : Lost Oxlade-Chamberlain for the opener , and looked to be in a mild panic whenever he had the ball . <p> Jack Rodwell -- 4 : Sunderland have n't won in the 33 league games Rodwell has started . Not to suggest that 's his fault per se , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Didier Ndong -- 5 : Earns a 5 for bombing forward looking to create something at times in the game , but he did so aimlessly.
