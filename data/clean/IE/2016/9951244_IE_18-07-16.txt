By Kevin Galvin at Turner 's Cross  Kenny Jackett 's youthful side continued their pre-season preparations with a narrow victory at Turner 's Cross  Wolverhampton Wanderers strolled to a one goal win over Cork City at Turner 's Cross , with Wolves boss Kenny Jackett calling on a number of fringe players ahead of the new Championship season .  With the domestic season well underway in Ireland , these cross-channel friendlies are often known for their lack of competitiveness , and when Bright Enobakhare put the ball through the legs of Shane McInerney before squaring for 17 year-old Niall Ennis to finish from close range , the miniscule home attendance must have been fearing the same .  City however , fielding some first-team players including Karl Sheppard , Gavan Hoolahan and Colin Healy amongst their ranks battled back , and on the half-hour mark Conor Ellis found himself unmarked from Ian Turner 's cross , but could notkeep his header down from the apex of the six-yard box .  The hosts had legitimate shouts for a penalty just before the half , with his back to goal , was dragged down by Wolves centre-back Aaron Hayden , however referee Anthony Buttimer was unsympathetic to his claims .  Visiting Wolves then doubled their advantage right on the hour mark , as man of the match Ben O'Hanlon 's cross found the onrushing head of Enobakhare who simply could not miss from six yards out .  City introduced four Under-19s graduates into the game , and some wonderful play by Chiedoze Ogbene saw him cross to the back post for Aaron Drinan ; Drinan was perfectly positioned tp head the ball for Cian Coleman to nod home to cut the deficit .  With Wolves keeping things tight at the back , the game fizzled out to a rather anti-climactic finish , as the visitors eased to victory .  A tiny , and unreported attendance was indicative of the opinion of Cork CIty fans , as they look ahead to Thursday 's Uefa Europa League second leg against BK Hacken.
