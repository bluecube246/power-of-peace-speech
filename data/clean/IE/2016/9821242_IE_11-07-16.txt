<h> Ex-commissioner McCreevy calls for ' common sense ' Brexit talks <p> Charlie McCreevy said it was too early to say whether Ireland will be a big beneficiary of Brexit <p> Former EU commissioner Charlie McCreevy said it would be " the height of folly " if parts of the 28-member European Union took a " vindictive " approach to talks on the UK 's exit . <p> " The UK is and will remain one of the world 's largest economies and thus it would make no sense for either the EU or the UK not to have a close relationship into the future , " Mr McCreevy told reporters in Naas , Co . Kildare as he was appointed as chairman of financial services firm Murray Spelman . <p> Mr McCreevy , who was the European commissioner for internal market and services from 2004 -- 2010 , said he hopes common sense will prevail on both sides of the talks , when they happen . <p> While Ireland was in a " difficult position " during the negotiations given its close links to the UK and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enda Kenny 's Government has taken a pragmatic approach . <p> " Britain came to the support of its European partners in the two World Wars of the 20th Century . Given that history , it would be more than ironic if countries on mainland Europe did not treat the UK in a very fair manner in the upcoming negotiations , " Mr McCreevy said . <p> He said it was too early to say whether Ireland will be a big beneficiary of Brexit as multinational companies , particularly banks and financial services groups , look at moving business out of London following the vote . He also declined to comment on Fianna Fail 's recent surge in opinion polls and mounting speculation in recent days on Mr Kenny 's future as Taoiseach .
