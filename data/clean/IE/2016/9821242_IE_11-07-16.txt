ex-commissioner mccreevy calls for ' common sense ' brexit talks  charlie mccreevy said it was too early to say whether ireland will be a big beneficiary of brexit  former eu commissioner charlie mccreevy said it would be " the height of folly " if parts of the 28-member european union took a " vindictive " approach to talks on the uk 's exit .  " the uk is and will remain one of the world 's largest economies and thus it would make no sense for either the eu or the uk not to have a close relationship into the future , " mr mccreevy told reporters in naas , co . kildare as he was appointed as chairman of financial services firm murray spelman .  mr mccreevy , who was the european commissioner for internal market and services from 2004 -- 2010 , said he hopes common sense will prevail on both sides of the talks , when they happen .  while ireland was in a " difficult position " during the negotiations given its close links to the uk and enda kenny 's government has taken a pragmatic approach .  " britain came to the support of its european partners in the two world wars of the 20th century . given that history , it would be more than ironic if countries on mainland europe did not treat the uk in a very fair manner in the upcoming negotiations , " mr mccreevy said .  he said it was too early to say whether ireland will be a big beneficiary of brexit as multinational companies , particularly banks and financial services groups , look at moving business out of london following the vote . he also declined to comment on fianna fail 's recent surge in opinion polls and mounting speculation in recent days on mr kenny 's future as taoiseach .
