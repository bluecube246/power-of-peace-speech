<p> Peter Capaldi 's remarks to a South American outlet had been interpreted as suggesting that the Doctor 's new assistant had been recruited with the Scottish-born actor set to be paired with a replacement for Jenna Coleman . <p> The Blackpool-born actress left the long-running sci-fi series in 2015 . <p> " Peter gave an interview to a South American outlet called Omelete because he is on a South American press tour promoting season nine of Doctor Who at the moment , " the spokeswoman said . <p> However , the spokeswoman could not comment on whether the new Doctor Who companion has been cast . <p> After the Omelete story was picked up in the UK , it sparked a good deal of speculation on social media . <p> One Twitter user offered a theory that the forthcoming companion could be John Malkovich . <p> Capaldi , 57 , had appeared in the American 's 1988 blockbuster movie Dangerous Liaisons . <h> Your Comments <p> Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concise and to the point .
