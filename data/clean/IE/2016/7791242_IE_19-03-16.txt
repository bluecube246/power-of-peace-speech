Peter Capaldi 's remarks to a South American outlet had been interpreted as suggesting that the Doctor 's new assistant had been recruited with the Scottish-born actor set to be paired with a replacement for Jenna Coleman .  The Blackpool-born actress left the long-running sci-fi series in 2015 .  " Peter gave an interview to a South American outlet called Omelete because he is on a South American press tour promoting season nine of Doctor Who at the moment , " the spokeswoman said .  However , the spokeswoman could not comment on whether the new Doctor Who companion has been cast .  After the Omelete story was picked up in the UK , it sparked a good deal of speculation on social media .  One Twitter user offered a theory that the forthcoming companion could be John Malkovich .  Capaldi , 57 , had appeared in the American 's 1988 blockbuster movie Dangerous Liaisons .
