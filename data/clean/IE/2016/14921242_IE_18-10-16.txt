Graham Norton was in town last night for an event to launch his debut novel ' Holding ' in the Round Room of Dublin 's Mansion House . It marks the broadcaster 's first work of fiction and is already earning critical acclaim and he has even sold the production rights already .  Over the course of the evening , he talked about his much-loved BBC chat show and some of his favourite guests , saying ; " Madonna was amazing . I wanted Brad and Angelina but I feel the chances are a bit slim now " .  He was also asked his opinion on The Late Late Show , which of course the entire country seems to love to hate at times , but Norton was quick to defend the RTE show ; " You can not compare , " he said .  " They are not like for like . We 're in London so these people are in town . I think The Late Late Show punches well above its weight . "  A fair point , and one Late Late Show of a Friday . Although they really do n't help themselves when they give away a bag of spuds to everyone in the audience .  Graham is also set to host a new Saturday night show in the New Year on the BBC alongside Great British Bake Off 's Mel Giedroyc which will see Gary Barlow on the search for an actor for his musical ' The Band ' , about the rise of Take That .
