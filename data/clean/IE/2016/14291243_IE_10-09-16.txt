donald cerrone wants to fight . he wants to fight you . he wants to fight me . he wants to fight everybody . he wants to fight anybody . he will do it on a couple of weeks notice . he will do it on a couple of days notice . hell , he will do it on a couple of hours notice .  cerrone has become famed in recent years for his hyperactivity and his willingness to dive headlong into fights on short notice . the line " i know a guy " has become something of a social media catchphrase for ' cowboy ' and he throws it out there every time there is even a hint that the ufc might be looking to replace an injured or otherwise debilitated fighter .  cerrone 's ever-burning need to punch faces was once again evident in a text message exchange with ufc president dana white on friday , a screenshot of which white posted to instagram shortly after .  though the promotion has yet to officially acknowledge it , cb dolloway may be 203 -- that is at least what is implied in the texts between white and cerrone .  folks , in case you are n't aware , barroso is a light-heavyweight ! while cerrone is a welterweight who campaigned at lightweight until this year . and , just as importantly , the show was about 24 hours away at the time of this exchange .  now , maybe cerrone is just having a little fun , but white did n't seem to be taking it that way , as he begged the question " who is better , crazier or more bad ass than @cowboycerrone ? "  ufc vice president of public relations , athlete marketing and development , dave sholler also tweeted this out shortly afterwards .  does white 's post add weight to a recent report that cerrone 's scheduled ufc 205 opponent robbie lawler has withdrawn from their fight ? it 's hard to imagine that the jackson-wink fighter would be volunteering to do something like this if he had such a big showdown to look forward to in a couple of months .
