Taking the Homer Simpson approach to bin collection
http://www.businesspost.ie/taking-the-homer-simpson-approach-to-bin-collection/

that was the catchcry of homer simpson , who promised a simple solution to springfield 's waste crisis .  in one of the most famous episodes of the simpsons , homer promised to deliver an all-singing , all-dancing bin collection service and was quickly elected as the town 's sanitation commissioner . but it all went horribly wrong . he cut corners by stuffing the waste into disused mines under springfield -- eventually causing an explosion of trash which destroyed the town .  it is a clear attempt to push back the problem -- but this minority-government does n't exactly have a strong hand . but so far it is still at least trying preserve the principle of pay-by-weight bin charges .  in contrast , some of the opposition parties seem to be adapting homer 's slogan of " ca n't somebody else do it ? " into " ca n't somebody else pay for it ? " . and the results could be just as damaging in the long term .  sinn f ? in have signalled their opposition to the concept leader mary lou mcdonald saying it could be funded instead through general taxation .  the anti-austerity alliance and people before profit alliance , who are bringing forward a d ? il motion today on bin charges , want bin collection services to be run again by councils rather than private firms . but many of their members were to the forefront of the campaign in the late 1990s to refuse to pay bin charges to councils . the councils were starved of income and pulled out , leaving the market to the private waste collectors . of course , the argument here is that councils should have got more funding from government to provide the service . so it is back to the " general taxation " argument here too . as social protection minister leo varadkar has pointed out , that is a code for saying the middle class should pay for everything and that others should pay nothing .  so far fianna f ? il have supported the introduction of pay-by-weight charging , through its environment spokesman barry cowen . but it will be interesting to see ? in and the aaa-pbp .  the bin charges controversy is another sign of course that the government appears to have learnt very little from the water charges debacle .  just like with water charges , there appears to have been a deliberate attempt to introduce them with minimal publicity . there was a publicity campaign launched last month at council level , but it is fair to say that most people would have never heard about it .  just like water charges , there has been no clarity provided on the actual cost . bin companies have sent out letters with their new prices per kilo , and their increased standing charges . but it is far from clear to many households what their final annual bill will be .  and just like water charges , there has also been a failure to provide the clear environmental justification for the charge . the need to upgrade the country 's creaking water infrastructure was only really demonstrated after there were huge anti-water charge protests .  similarly , there have already been outraged callers to rte 's to explain the reasons for the pay-by-weight system .  there is clear evidence that pay-by-weight is the best way of keeping as much waste as possible out of black bins -- which usually ends up in dumps . one study published in 2011 said it could keep 446,000 tonnes out of dumps , which are due to be completely full within ten years anyway . that is because households have a financial incentive to put as much food waste into the brown bin and as much recyclables into the green bin .  some are already doing this . but there are other households who do not put out their brown bin at all . and in other parts of the country , waste collectors are still not offering a brown bin collection service despite much pressure to do so from the department of the environment . pay-by-weight is an attempt to put in a national system to improve the country 's very patchy waste collection system .  but just like water charges , a botched roll out has put the entire project under threat . as homer would political editor with the sunday business post . a native of milltown , co galway , he attended st jarlath 's college in tuam and has a degree in journalism from dcu . after working with mid west radio and the irish emigrant newspaper in boston , he joined the examiner in cork , where he won the young journalist of the year award in 2004 . he later spent two years as a reporter with the press association in dublin , and worked for the irish independent for seven years as political correspondent and then deputy political editor .
