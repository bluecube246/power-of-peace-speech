<p> When it came to family matters , she said that her two offspring were now in their 30s and both had jobs which seemed to suit them quite well . " But I wish to God they 'd settle down and start having babies ! I mean , while we 're still young enough and fit enough to be active grandparents . " Gemma and her husband are heading for their mid-60s . <p> Gemma was n't so sure , though . She observed that this 30-something generation seem to set up in relationships , live together for a few years , and then break up . Then it 's back to square one : looking for the right partner with whom to embark on nesting , and perhaps reproducing , if all parties are agreed . <p> And then there 's the mortgage problem . The job , the mortgage , the relationship : all the ducks have to be in line , it seems . It takes time . Maybe Gemma and Peter would be hitting 70 by the time they could call themselves Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an active toddler once they had the hip replacements , the knee replacements , the hearing aids , and all the rest of the paraphernalia that goes with declining years ? <p> " Now is the time for me to grandparent , " she insisted . <p> But of course , she had n't said any of this to her grown-up kids . There 's a freemasonry rule among oldies who came to adulthood in the 1960s and 1970s : we do n't interfere in our adult children 's lives . We do n't tell them to do this , that or the other " for their own good " - because we swore on a metaphorical stack of bibles , back then , that we would never be like our own mothers and aunts , fathers and uncles , trying to direct and " control " our destinies . <p> It 's their life ; it 's their choice . That 's the mantra . Our role is to maintain omerta . So the parents of adult offspring prefer to confide in one another . " When is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's broken up with that lovely , suitable , girl - when will he commit ? " " Do n't they read the statistics about older mothers ? " " Are they going to leave it so long they 'll be queuing up at the IVF clinic ? " <p> The statistics about older mothers ! We now have the oldest Irish mothers on record - Irish women are having their first babies at a later age than ever before . <p> The Master of the National Maternity Hospital , Dr Rhona Mahony , noted recently that the proportion of women giving birth over 35 has " surged " in the last decade - up 20pc since 2003 . And while babies are surely always welcome at Holles Street - it 's their business - Dr Mahony also added that the trend towards older mothers has caused a " huge amount of complications " in maternal care . <p> And then there is this knock-on problem with the next generation up . To become a grandparent in your 60s is , usually , great timing . The demographic of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , and often comfortably off - and thus in an ideal position to support parents in their 30s . <p> But push it a decade later and it ai n't so simple . The oldies have often become less fit , and instead of being a support and a help to the young parents , may become more of a worry . Thus you get the " sandwich generation " of exhausted women in their 40s looking after their young children , and their old parents , simultaneously . <p> I sympathise with Gemma ( and I know at least two other couples in their 60s with similar complaints ) but it 's not easy to see an immediate solution . Jobs , houses , partners in life may need luck , opportunity and serendipity as well as timing . Not to mention the stewardship of the economy . <p> Yet we could generally put it about a bit more emphatically that men , especially , should feel some obligation to commit to relationships , after a given length of time . And especially once they hit 30 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning counsellor once told me that many of the " unplanned pregnancies " she works with are more likely to be , in truth , " relationship testing " pregnancies . Consciously , " an accident " , or " contraceptive failure " may be offered as the reason for the pregnancy being unexpected - and yes , genuine accidents do happen - but the couple 's reaction , as a couple , was still very significant . The baby is the test of the relationship . <p> For many , that 's not the way they want to start their settled-down life together - with an unplanned or crisis pregnancy . They want to be responsible . They want to plan . They want to be ready to become parents . And fair play to those who prefer to be organised about these things . <p> Yet : the admirable war historian , Barbara Tuchman , wrote that she found she was pregnant just as war broke out and her husband was drafted into the military . Not the best time to have a baby , was her first reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a perfect time , and sometimes you just have to go with nature 's prompting . <p> To whom it concerns , perhaps an appropriate message for Valentine 's Day in a Leap Year : get breedin ' ! <h> Your Comments <p> Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted .
