<h> Tom Hiddleston reportedly in advanced negotiations for Bond role <p> Bookies have stopped taking bets on Tom Hiddleston becoming the next James Bond , and the official announcement seems to be getting ever closer with the news that Hiddleston is now in advanced negotiations to take up the role . <p> Sources close to the actor have confirmed that the negotiations are taking place , and Hiddleston himself has stated he would like the role . <p> Despite Jamie Bell throwing his name into the ring earlier this week , Hiddleston has long been the forerunner . He 's not a bad choice either ; his work in this year 's High-Rise and The Night Manager showed what he could bring to the role . However , you 'd have to admit that he is a conventional choice . <p> Anyone who hoped that the character of James Bond might be taken in a new direction , even transformed into a Jane Bond , will probably have to wait a few more years . <p> Either way , we hope that an announcement is made soon so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the next Bond film .
