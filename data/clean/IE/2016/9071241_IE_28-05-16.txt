tom hiddleston reportedly in advanced negotiations for bond role  bookies have stopped taking bets on tom hiddleston becoming the next james bond , and the official announcement seems to be getting ever closer with the news that hiddleston is now in advanced negotiations to take up the role .  sources close to the actor have confirmed that the negotiations are taking place , and hiddleston himself has stated he would like the role .  despite jamie bell throwing his name into the ring earlier this week , hiddleston has long been the forerunner . he 's not a bad choice either ; his work in this year 's high-rise and the night manager showed what he could bring to the role . however , you 'd have to admit that he is a conventional choice .  anyone who hoped that the character of james bond might be taken in a new direction , even transformed into a jane bond , will probably have to wait a few more years .  either way , we hope that an announcement is made soon so about the next bond film .
