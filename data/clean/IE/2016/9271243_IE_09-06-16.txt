paul pogba opens up on his manchester united exit  sir alex ferguson will not have many regrets in his career , but allowing paul pogba to leave manchester united so easily will surely be one of them .  the french midfielder was criminally underused during his time at old trafford , with ferguson preferring the likes of tom cleverley and even right back rafael da silva as central midfield backup .  pogba grew tired of a lack of opportunities at the club ( a fact he has never been shy in discussing ) , so he departed for juventus where he became one of the biggest stars in the game .  speaking to espn recently , pogba revealed that ferguson had wanted to keep him at the club , and while the france international respected him as a person and coach , he had made up his mind to depart :  " ferguson 's a coach i respect a lot . but he 's a human . i 'm someone who says what he thinks .  " ferguson came to my . he wanted to keep me , but i 'd made my decision to leave . "  pogba 's latest insight into his manchester united departure comes after the player 's mother revealed on tuesday that ferguson had made her son cry .  speaking to french news agency afp , yeo moriba stated that ferguson arrived at their house in an effort to persuade him to sign a manchester united contract , but after discussing it as a family , turned him down :  " i said : ' what ? ferguson coming to my house ! he came alone ' ,  " we had got together with his brothers and we decided : he wo n't re-sign .  " ferguson punished him , he did n't play him , paul was alone . he even cried in ferguson 's office over the way he was treated . "  in the espn interview , pogba also paid tribute to legendary midfielder scholes . whom he played alongside in the early stages of his career . scholes ' own career was winding down at that point -- but the young superstar still felt he learned a lot from watching him train :  " with them scholes and ryan giggs you train to the end , up to perfection , because paul scholes -- despite his age -- was still there at the end of practice , hitting long passes , shots . he did n't miss one . when you 're there , you have to adapt fast . i like that -- always challenges . "  since moving to juventus in 2012 , pogba has won four serie a titles , two coppa italias. and was in the starting lineup as the bianconeri lost the 2015 champions league final .  his future has been the subject of much speculation already this summer , with manchester city , real madrid and former club manchester united all being linked with a move . reports even suggest that pogba could move for as much as ? 100m.
