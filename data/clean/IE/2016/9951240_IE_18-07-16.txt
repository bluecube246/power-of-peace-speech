US secretary of state John Kerry says Erdogan must provide ' evidence , not allegations '  John Kerry and Federica Mogherini ahead of a EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels yesterday . Photograph : Laurent Dubrule/EPA  The US and the European Union toughened their stance against Turkey yesterday as they urged Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to " not go beyond the rule of law " as he deals with the aftermath of the failed military coup .  Speaking in Brussels where EU foreign ministers gathered for a scheduled meeting , US secretary of state John Kerry urged the Turkish government to " uphold the highest standard of respect . . . for the rule of law . We support bringing the perpetrators of the coup to justice , but we caution a reach that goes beyond that . "  Amid deepening tensions between Washington and Ankara over the status of Islamic cleric Fetullah G ? len , whom Mr Erdogan has accused of plotting the coup , Mr Kerry said Turkey must provide " evidence , not allegations " about Mr consider his extradition .  Extradite The Turkish president has called for the US to extradite his former ally who is living in exile in Pennsylvania . " The US has a formal process for dealing with extradition requests , " Mr Kerry said , noting that Ankara had not yet requested the extradition .  In an indication of the diplomatic sensitivities surrounding the Turkish-US relationship the US secretary of state expressed support for Turkey as a fellow Nato member , noting that the country is a " key partner to the EU " . " We stand squarely on the side of elected leadership , " he said .  As EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels also responded to Friday 's events , Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan warned against any moves to reintroduce the death penalty would be in breach of Turkey 's EU obligations as an accession country . Freedom " I along with my EU partners call upon the Turkish authorities , police and security to show restraint , and to respect democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to obligations which preclude the application of the death penalty , " he said .  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Turkey 's " democratic and legitimate institutions need to be protected " . But she added : " This does not mean obviously that the rule of law and the system of checks and balances in the country does not count . On the contrary , it needs to be protected for the sake of the country itself . . . We will send a strong message on that . "  While EU and world leaders broadly backed Mr Erdogan 's government in the wake of the failed weekend coup , there is growing unease that a backlash from Erdogan 's government could breach democratic standards , a development which would almost certainly undermine the EU 's promise of visa-free travel for Turkey , a key part of the EU-Turkey migration deal .  In one of the strongest interventions by a senior EU figure , EU commissioner Johannes Hahn , who is responsible for relations with Turkey , suggested that Mr Erdogan had already planned a list . " It looks at least as if something has been prepared , " he said . " The lists are available , which indicates it was prepared and to be used at a certain stage . I 'm very concerned . It is exactly what we feared . "  Boris Johnson , who attended his first meeting of EU foreign ministers since his appointment as British foreign secretary last week , called for " restraint and moderation on all sides " .  Abandoning Mr Johnson , whose arrival in Brussels on Sunday night was delayed for several hours after his plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Luton airport , said Britain would be in no sense leaving Europe , despite last month 's decision to leave the European Union . The government must " give effect to the will of the people and leave the European Union , " he said . " But that in no sense means that we are leaving Europe . We are not going to be in any way abandoning our leading role in European co-operation and participation of all the failed coup in Turkey , saying that a military coup was not acceptable . But he added " at the same time , we have to be vigilant that the Turkish authorities do not put in place a political system that could derail democracy .
