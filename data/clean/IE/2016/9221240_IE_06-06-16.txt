the weekly protests resumed on monday after attempts to start negotiations between the government and the opposition on how to reform the independent electoral and boundaries commission failed .  police initially barred the demonstrations , but a court ruled that the constitution allows picketing and ordered police to provide protesters with security .  opposition leader and former prime minister raila odinga led peaceful demonstrations in the capital , nairobi , but police in kisumu tear-gassed demonstrators who responded by throwing stones .  a witness said two protesters were shot dead . police said the protesters had attacked them .  two weeks ago , one protester died in kisumu , an opposition stronghold , and two in neighbouring siaya county in similar protests .  the electoral commission 's chairman , issack hassan , said the commission will not be disbanded and challenged the opposition to provide evidence of the alleged corruption and bias .  some commission members have been named in a case in which two executives of british printing firm smith and ouzman were convicted in the uk for making corrupt to win business for the company .  mr odinga , who lost the 2013 presidential election to uhuru kenyatta , said the protests will continue until the commission is disbanded .  mr kenyatta has said he does not have the power to disband the commission and all negotiations should be done in parliament .  the opposition says the government has a majority in parliament and will ensure the motion does not go through .
