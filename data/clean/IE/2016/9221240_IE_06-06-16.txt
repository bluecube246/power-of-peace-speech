The weekly protests resumed on Monday after attempts to start negotiations between the government and the opposition on how to reform the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission failed .  Police initially barred the demonstrations , but a court ruled that the constitution allows picketing and ordered police to provide protesters with security .  Opposition leader and former prime minister Raila Odinga led peaceful demonstrations in the capital , Nairobi , but police in Kisumu tear-gassed demonstrators who responded by throwing stones .  A witness said two protesters were shot dead . Police said the protesters had attacked them .  Two weeks ago , one protester died in Kisumu , an opposition stronghold , and two in neighbouring Siaya county in similar protests .  The electoral commission 's chairman , Issack Hassan , said the commission will not be disbanded and challenged the opposition to provide evidence of the alleged corruption and bias .  Some commission members have been named in a case in which two executives of British printing firm Smith and Ouzman were convicted in the UK for making corrupt to win business for the company .  Mr Odinga , who lost the 2013 presidential election to Uhuru Kenyatta , said the protests will continue until the commission is disbanded .  Mr Kenyatta has said he does not have the power to disband the commission and all negotiations should be done in parliament .  The opposition says the government has a majority in parliament and will ensure the motion does not go through .
