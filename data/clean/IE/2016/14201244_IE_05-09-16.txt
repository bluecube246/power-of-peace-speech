cavan slips in latest litter rankings  co cavan has dropped a further seven places , the third slip in successive years in the latest irish business against litter rankings .  the county now sits at 31 out of over 40 towns surveyed across the county , in a list which saw neighbouring monaghan bump up from its previous position to 19 .  both towns are " clean to european norms " .  cavan is a four time winner of the anti litter league , and up until last year had consistently held a top three position in the league and has only twice finished outside the top 4 .  while nearly all of ireland 's main towns are now clean , ibal says pockets of our major cities continue to suffer from significant levels of litter . a study , conducted by an taisce , showed only two of 25 towns surveyed to be littered , but 7 of the 8 bottom places in the rankings to be occupied by city areas . ibal says councils need to concentrate on those specific taisce report on cavan stated ; " there were some moderately littered sites in cavan which just missed getting the top litter grade e.g. bridge street , church street and cavan bus station ( interior ) -- with a little extra care and attention this could easily be achieved . the library &amp; environs was an excellent site with all aspects in very good order . cavan bus station ( exterior ) was seriously littered and certainly had the appearance of a lack of thorough cleaning for quite some time . "  the report on monaghan stated : " all the approach roads to monaghan town got the top litter grade , creating a positive first impression of the town . other top ranking sites included the diamond town centre , peter 's lake , monaghan museum and tourist office at market square and lidl on coolshannagh road -- these sites were n't just clear of litter but very nicely presented and maintained . peter 's lake , in particular , is a lovely waterside resource right in the centre of the town . the one grade d site has site commonly known as ' sam 's diner ' behind maxol/ mace just beside coolshannagh roundabout has been seriously neglected over a prolonged period of time .
