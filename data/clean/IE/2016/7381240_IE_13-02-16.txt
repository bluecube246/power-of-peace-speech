' I 've lived here for just under a year , and I rent because I do n't currently have a strong interest in investing in property . It 's a beautiful place , and I enjoy the hustle and bustle in the day time and the dramatic stillness of the area at night . I love the modern landscape , the views and the general vibe of the Silicon Docks .  Proximity to work is important for me too ; it 's about a 30-minute commute to work now , but previously it would have only been 10 or 15 minutes .  Renting suits my needs right now ; I like the flexibility of the location , the freedom from a long contract and it 's cheaper than a mortgage in the short term when you consider taxes and maintenance costs . I also like the included amenities - the security and handyman aspect . The cons are the restrictions of landlords and letting agents , and the possibility of rent rising . In the long term , all rent payments amount only to for me , it 's just a ? temporary solution . The plan is to own one or even multiple properties someday ; I guess another upside to renting is that it allows me to focus my investments in other markets now and look into property later .  My tips for happy renting would be to make multiple viewing appointments before signing on the dotted line , and make sure you 're fully informed of what your rent covers .
