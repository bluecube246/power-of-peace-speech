' i 've lived here for just under a year , and i rent because i do n't currently have a strong interest in investing in property . it 's a beautiful place , and i enjoy the hustle and bustle in the day time and the dramatic stillness of the area at night . i love the modern landscape , the views and the general vibe of the silicon docks .  proximity to work is important for me too ; it 's about a 30-minute commute to work now , but previously it would have only been 10 or 15 minutes .  renting suits my needs right now ; i like the flexibility of the location , the freedom from a long contract and it 's cheaper than a mortgage in the short term when you consider taxes and maintenance costs . i also like the included amenities - the security and handyman aspect . the cons are the restrictions of landlords and letting agents , and the possibility of rent rising . in the long term , all rent payments amount only to for me , it 's just a ? temporary solution . the plan is to own one or even multiple properties someday ; i guess another upside to renting is that it allows me to focus my investments in other markets now and look into property later .  my tips for happy renting would be to make multiple viewing appointments before signing on the dotted line , and make sure you 're fully informed of what your rent covers .
