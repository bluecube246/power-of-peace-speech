Oh when the Delta Saints come .... ....  The Smithwick 's Kilkenny Roots Festival has built its reputation on bringing performers to Ireland before anyone else has noticed them .  In the past acts such as Ryan Adams , Calexico , Ray LaMontagne and Alabama Shakes have all made their Irish festival debuts in Kilkenny before going on to huge acclaim around the world .  This year a new clutch of acts arrive in Kilkenny that will be unknown to all but the most discerning music fans , but are very likely to make a big impression in the coming years .  The Delta Saints are a case in point . The Nashville based band has been around for a few years , but arrive in Kilkenny with a new record deal and a new album to promote .  " We 've tried for years to get into Ireland and the UK , but have only played mainland Europe up until his year , " said the band 's bass player , David Supica , on the phone from Nashville . " able to make Ireland due to financial reasons in the past . But  luckily , our time has come and we get to enjoy our Irish debut in a few short weeks . "  Nashville to Kilkenny for two nights and then straight back home seems like a tough schedule , but it does n't seem to bother the Delta Saints .  " Honestly , it 's pretty ideal ! " says David . " Our typical US tour schedule can involve some insane drives ( sometimes 10 and 12 hours ) in our van which we 're driving ourselves . I 'd much rather just sit on an airplane for 8 hours and arrive at our beautiful destination after a few beers and a couple of  hours sleep . Obviously the jet lag is never fun , but it 's worth it to finally get to Ireland . We 've been looking forward to this day for quite some time . "  The typical Kilkenny Roots Festival programme ranges from the quiet , introspective solo artists through to louder , rocking bands , particularly for latter . We 've grown a lot as a band over the years . Our first EP would be considered extremely rootsy , but since then our sound has gotten a bit more experimental and a much more electric . We 're proud of our roots in blues music , but have been trying to push the bounds of the genre in recent years . "  Trying to describe their style is not so easy . They have drawn comparisons to bands as diverse as Led Zeppelin and African band , Tinariwen . " We 're all very dedicated to constant evolution and change . If two albums sound the same , then what 's the point of releasing a new album ? It 's really quite a balancing act . To put out new material that will both please fans of our older music , but push them to new musical territory . Sometimes we 're more successful than others , but we 're always trying to bring our old fans with us into our newer sound . If you listen to Pray On ( our oldest release ) we want you to hear the same band but in a completely new light . "  Despite the strains of constant touring and the financial pressures of the current music business , the band have managed to keep going and have now signed a deal with the prestigious Loud and Proud label ( which has been home to Lynyrd Skynyrd , KISS , Robert Plant and Lenny Kravitz ) in the USA .  " We were lucky to find a home at L&amp;P . Releasing music independently is rewarding but ridiculously hard work . With how demanding our tour schedule is , it 's nice to be able to hand over the reins to a competent company and just focusing on writing music and touring . We 've been hard at work demoing some new songs ( that we may debut in Kilkenny ! ) and looking toward recording a new album . " The Delta Saints will arrive in Kilkenny next weekend for two shows and will be back home in Nashville at the same time as the festival concludes . Their first show is at Kytelers at The Set Theatre on Sunday May 1 at 11pm .
