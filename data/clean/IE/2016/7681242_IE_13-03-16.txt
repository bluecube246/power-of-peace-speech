DONAL O'GRADY : A step in the right direction for rising Cork  This was a superb contest last Saturday night . Cork were six points up and it looked as if they were going to hold out for a much needed win with five minutes remaining in normal time .  The League points on offer were of little consequence to Cork but putting one over on the All-Ireland champions would have given them a much needed boost .  Cork were the better team in the first period . Kilkenny 's management restructured the forward line at half time and it had a better balance thereafter . Walter Walsh , now right half forward , helped out in midfield while replacement James Maher operated on the left flank of the attack and brought more strength and industry . Richie Hogan went to top of the left , effectively playing a free role .  Colin Fennelly , one of their most effective attackers in the first-half , went to full-forward while midfielder Lester Ryan , an early replacement for the unfortunate Conor Fogarty , pushed Paul Murphy held his position well : he did n't follow Luke O'Farrell out the field and swept up in front of the full back line .  Kilkenny ran more directly at the Cork defence in the second-half and probed for weaknesses . Their hard work was rewarded with two goals as the clock ticked down . Colin Fennelly played a lovely ' one two ' with Richie Hogan who delayed his ' over the top ' pass just long enough to put Fennelly through with the ball being knocked over the line by the scrambling defence . Moments later TJ Reid released John Power . His miss hit pass fell to the supporting Reid , who goaled .  They snatched victory at the death and ultimately it was the small things their experience gave them that saw them home .  At the other end Cork showed some inexperience . Bill Cooper shot wide from a tight angle and O'Farrell went for a ' hail Mary ' from the wing when a cross towards the excellent Seamus Harnedy would have been the better option . Cork struck 12 and Conor Lehane were costly . They shot too quickly when a little extra composure might have paid dividends at a time Kilkenny were under pressure . I wrote on Saturday the game was all about guts , effort , being highly competitive and learning for future battles .  Whether Cork learned a lot will be determined later in the season but no one could fault them on the competitive aspects of their performance .  Their application and commitment was high from the throw in and they won the first half battle . It was obvious the hosts were up for this and Midleton pair , O'Farrell and Conor Lehane set the work rate standard .  In general play the half back line of Cormac Murphy , Christopher Joyce , who looks much more at home in this line , and Lorcan McLoughlin led a heroic defence , whose determination , tenacity and ' never say die ' spirit was in evidence all night .  But I also wrote on Saturday good discipline was a prerequisite to compete with Kilkenny . Too many frees were conceded by points from frees . Why hand him easy chances ? It makes more sense to force the other attackers to shoot under pressure and take your chances . At least half of the frees conceded by Cork could have been avoided with disciplined tackling .  At the death a misplaced delivery by Cork goalkeeper Patrick Collins straight to John Power decided the game . But if Cork had n't conceded as many frees maybe the fixture might have been decided in their favour at that juncture .  Collins had distributed the ball well and he will be disappointed with his misplaced pass . However it says something about his character he was n't prepared to settle for a draw - he was attempting to win the game by putting his team in possession . Attempting to do the right thing is always a mitigating factor when it comes to constructive criticism . His execution let him down on this occasion . He set up as if he was striking to his nearest colleague but it was as if he changed his mind on his downward swing . He may be very satisfied with his display overall .  Cork need to work on taking a quick look before striking to the forwards but there are plenty of positives .  Kilkenny will be very happy with this win . It 's reminiscent of their recent victory over Tipp , illustrating once more their undoubted resilience.
