<p> Sean Scully was playing with friends near his home in Croftwood Gardens , Ballyfermot , Dublin in June 2014 when a row broke out between a number of men living in the area . <p> The men left the scene , but returned with a handgun and fired at the intended target . <p> One bullet pierced through the boy 's body above his collar bone and ruptured the nerves in his neck , causing permanent damage to his spinal cord . <p> Sean was left permanently paralysed after the incident . <p> His mother Gillian told Independent.ie that she has been sleeping downstairs with Sean since the incident and says he regularly gets very frightened . <p> Sean Scully <p> " He is generally in good form , but gets very down at times . <p> " Sean is only nine and because of what happened he wo n't sleep on his own anymore . I have to sleep on the sofa beside him every night because he gets very frightened living here . <p> " We do n't want to extend our house and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here . <p> " We want to have a proper home and are trying to get the government to rehouse us because of the antisocial behaviour here . <p> " Sometimes he gets so frightened and can not go to sleep . He realises he 's restricted and can not run away from anything like he used to before . <p> " We had a meeting with the Minister for Justice recently where we tried to express our case , but there has been no result . <p> " We want to get out of here , but I would n't want to remove Sean from his school because they 're just brilliant to him , " she added . <p> Sports Officer with Dublin City Council and family friend of the Scully family Derek Ahern told Independent.ie that Sean 's struggle continues every day . <p> " Sean is always in really good spirits and is such a great young man , but not a lot is being done for him in terms of his rehabilitation , " he said . <p> " It seems like the tragic event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's minds . The fact is that Sean is still here , but his struggle continues . <p> " His life , along with his family 's lives have totally turned upside down . They are still fighting this every day . <p> " People in power need to step up to the plate and do more for him . If he was coming from another area would his circumstances be different ? I think so . I just want to see him get a fair deal , " he said . <p> On Thursday , over ? 3,000 was raised for Sean in a football tournament held in the Ballyfermot Leisure Centre . <p> It was the tenth anniversary of the Ian Lyons Memorial 5-a-side tournament , which is held every year in memory of the 19-year-old man who was also Sean 's uncle . <p> The tournament was organised by Dublin City Council 's Sport and Wellbeing department in partnership with the FAI . <p> Mr Ahern added : " I 'm not a politician but I can at least try and use sport as a tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young lad from Cherry Orchard who was taken before his time . <p> " I used to work with him through football and his family were always very respected members of the community . We just felt like it was fitting to do something in his memory . <p> " Our aim is to send out a message to other young people in the community to stay on the right path in life , " he said . <h> Related Content <h> Your Comments <p> Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted .
