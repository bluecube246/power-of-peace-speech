sean scully was playing with friends near his home in croftwood gardens , ballyfermot , dublin in june 2014 when a row broke out between a number of men living in the area .  the men left the scene , but returned with a handgun and fired at the intended target .  one bullet pierced through the boy 's body above his collar bone and ruptured the nerves in his neck , causing permanent damage to his spinal cord .  sean was left permanently paralysed after the incident .  his mother gillian told independent.ie that she has been sleeping downstairs with sean since the incident and says he regularly gets very frightened .  sean scully  " he is generally in good form , but gets very down at times .  " sean is only nine and because of what happened he wo n't sleep on his own anymore . i have to sleep on the sofa beside him every night because he gets very frightened living here .  " we do n't want to extend our house and put stay here .  " we want to have a proper home and are trying to get the government to rehouse us because of the antisocial behaviour here .  " sometimes he gets so frightened and can not go to sleep . he realises he 's restricted and can not run away from anything like he used to before .  " we had a meeting with the minister for justice recently where we tried to express our case , but there has been no result .  " we want to get out of here , but i would n't want to remove sean from his school because they 're just brilliant to him , " she added .  sports officer with dublin city council and family friend of the scully family derek ahern told independent.ie that sean 's struggle continues every day .  " sean is always in really good spirits and is such a great young man , but not a lot is being done for him in terms of his rehabilitation , " he said .  " it seems like the tragic event government 's minds . the fact is that sean is still here , but his struggle continues .  " his life , along with his family 's lives have totally turned upside down . they are still fighting this every day .  " people in power need to step up to the plate and do more for him . if he was coming from another area would his circumstances be different ? i think so . i just want to see him get a fair deal , " he said .  on thursday , over ? 3,000 was raised for sean in a football tournament held in the ballyfermot leisure centre .  it was the tenth anniversary of the ian lyons memorial 5-a-side tournament , which is held every year in memory of the 19-year-old man who was also sean 's uncle .  the tournament was organised by dublin city council 's sport and wellbeing department in partnership with the fai .  mr ahern added : " i 'm not a politician but i can at least try and use sport as a tool to a young lad from cherry orchard who was taken before his time .

" our aim is to send out a message to other young people in the community to stay on the right path in life , " he said .  related content  your comments  comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted . comments must be concise and to the point . the moderator will not enter into debate with individual contributors and the moderator 's decision is final . the comment facility is removed after 48 hours .
