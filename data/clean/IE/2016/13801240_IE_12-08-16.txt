the two daughters of swedish industrialist fredrik lundberg have become billionaires this week as shares of the family 's investment company climbed to a record high .  louise lindh ( 36 ) and katarina martinson ( 35 ) each own a 14 per cent economic interest in publicly traded lundbergfoeretagen , according to the company 's 2015 annual report .  shares of the stockholm-based business have risen 28 per cent in the past 12 months and matched their all-time high of 517.5 swedish kronor ( $61.08 ) on thursday .  the stock is in part benefiting from a rise in real estate values in stockholm , where apartment prices have climbed 24 per cent in the past year , according to researcher real capital analytics .  property made up about 40 per cent of the company 's 59 billion kronor of market-valued assets at the end of may .  a scarcity of publicly available shares - the family controls 70 per cent of the capital and more than 90 per cent of the voting stock - is amplifying the price gains , securities .  the siblings ' ownership increased from 7.6 per cent at the start of 2015 after their father almost doubled their stakes in the family business by transferring some of his holdings .  the value of those shares , along with dividends and interests in other publicly traded assets , has given each of the sisters a $1.1 billion fortune , according to the bloomberg billionaires index .  the family declined to comment on their wealth , according to spokesman roger ekstrom . about four-fifths of the company 's net asset value comes from listed stocks , including property business hufvudstaden , which manages commercial and residential properties mainly in stockholm , and holmen , which owns forest land it uses to produce paper products .  unlisted real estate arm fastighets lundberg makes up the remainder . lundbergs was founded by the sisters ' grandfather , lars erik lundberg , an engineer who in 1944 started his own construction firm focused on developing residential buildings .
