<h> INTRODUCTION <p> Developers of driverless cars around the world are facing a major hurdle ; the absence of a legal framework that will allow their creations to be used on the road . This Briefing Note looks at how prepared Ireland is for the testing and arrival of driverless cars . <h> THE GLOBAL PICTURE <p> In the race towards driverless technology being available to the public , Singapore is leading the field , with the first ever public trial of robo-taxi services launched in August 2016 . The company behind the trial ( nuTonomy ) was the first company to get permission from the Singapore government to test the cars in small public area , and has now begun tests with passengers . The cars are still manned by a driver during this testing phase , however , the company intends to roll out a fully automated taxi service once approved . <p> The United States has recently begun to prioritise the introduction of regulatory provisions in order to advance the development of self-driving cars . As of June 2016 , some sixteen states had introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to take a cautious approach to the regulation of automated vehicles , subsequent revisions and reforms have revealed a willingness to put in place more progressive parameters . <p> In California , for example , fifteen companies currently hold permits to test driverless vehicles within the State . In 2015 , the California Department of Motor Vehicles ( " DMV " ) released draft regulations for the public deployment of autonomous vehicles . These regulations included requirements that the autonomous vehicles had to have a driver capable of taking the wheel , eliminating the possibility of a fully driverless car . Most recently the DMV indicated that the more advanced self-driving cars will no longer be required to have a licenced driver at the wheel if federal officials deem them sufficiently safe . <p> Until recently , the absence of U.S government guidance had left the burden on state DMVs to manage the introduction of driverless technology , however , new federal guidelines ( issued jointly by the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ) on the testing and deployment of driverless cars have now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics of regulation , they indicate that the Department of Transport will take responsibility for regulating the driving hardware and software , and have devised a model state policy which will relieve the pressure on individual state agencies . <h> THE VIENNA CONVENTION <p> The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic is an accord among the participating members of the United Nations which covers road traffic safety regulations . <p> One of the fundamental principles of the Convention ( Article 8 ) is the concept that the driver is fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic . Amendments have recently been made to the Convention which allow for the use of automated driving technologies or " driver assistance systems " which transfer driving tasks to the vehicle , provided that these technologies do not breach the United Nations general safety requirements for vehicles or can be overridden or switched off by the driver . This may be seen as the first step towards accommodating the concept of a driverless car within the Convention framework . However , Ireland is not a signatory to the Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this jurisdiction . <h> THE EU APPROACH <p> The European Union is currently funding research on automated road transport as a priority . The focus of this research is on how data protection and cyber security can be managed and how liability issues will be solved . Currently within the EU , deploying vehicles without a driver is only permitted by certain Member States which have put in place domestic legislation legalising the testing of automated vehicles in restricted areas ( for example on approved test routes ) . <h> THE DOMESTIC POSITION <p> The behavioural laws in relation to driving in Ireland are governed by the Road Traffic Act , 1961 ( as amended ) and road traffic offences are enforceable by An Garda S ? och ? na ( the Irish police force ) . Legislation is supplemented by guidance from the Road Safety Authority ( the " RSA " ) , a statutory body formed by the Irish Government to promote road safety . Legislation in Ireland does not yet conceive of the possibility of an automated vehicle and there are no anticipated changes to legislation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in place for a significant period of time is ( understandably ) aimed at what drivers are doing and seeking to ensure that drivers pay attention on the road . This includes requiring drivers to drive with due care and attention and not to drive a vehicle in a manner which is or is likely to be dangerous to the public . While one might argue that an automated vehicle means drivers do not need to " pay attention " and can not be " careless " , the reality is that the legislation does not contemplate what is proposed and that a new regime will be required . <h> CHALLENGES FOR INDUSTRY <p> The management of liability for autonomous vehicles will be a very important factor in the success of the industry . As human drivers will have less ( or no ) control over the choices made by the autonomous vehicle , the liability for accidents will fall primarily on the manufacturer of the vehicle ( or its software developer ) . This is a shift from the current position which sees drivers shoulder liability for the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault with the car ) . Regulators will need to consider whether it is fair that this new liability for autonomous vehicles should be borne solely by the manufacturer ( and they should also consider the likely impact that this will have on the cost of automated vehicles ) . <p> Some thought is already being given to the potential ethical choices which will have to be programmed into the software which will govern the behaviour of the autonomous vehicle . Those charged with programming the choices of autonomous vehicles will find themselves having to make choices in order to " optimise " the outcome of a certain crash . To illustrate the problem , some technological ethicists have drawn on the analogy of the classic trolley problem ? if a driverless car is certain to crash , should it be programmed to continue its course ( at the loss of several lives ) or divert its course in order to cause the loss of just a single life ? These are difficult ( perhaps impossible ) decisions for a manufacturer to make and might benefit from external guidance or regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divergence in the approach to the arrival of driverless technology . Widespread reform of domestic legislation in Ireland will be required in order to introduce a framework which allows for the possibility of a driverless vehicle . Aside from the complex legislative changes , there are a number of other issues which will impact this area . <p> Difficulties in legislating will be compounded by the different approaches taken by manufacturers in relation to driverless technology . For example , while some developers are focussing on mapping routes ( Google ) , others are exploring the possibility of smart streets ( incorporating sensors in roads and smart traffic lights systems ) in order to make the technology usable . <p> Aside from the required legislative changes , there will also be an impact on infrastructure , for which many countries may be under prepared . Notably , while there has been steady progress in legislation in the United States , few cities are considered to have incorporated autonomous vehicles into their long term planning processes . <p> This article contains a general summary of developments and is not a complete or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained where appropriate . <p> To print this article , all you need is to be registered on Mondaq.com . <p> Click to Login as an existing user or Register so you can print this article . <p> There has been a LOT of hype around the impact of robotics software on financial services , and indeed on all service industries , but there is still a lack of clarity around what this genre of software can do . <p> This service is completely free .
