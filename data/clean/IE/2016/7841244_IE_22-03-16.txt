Pro12 set for thrilling run-in as Irish provinces look to secure play-offs  Munster are in the greatest danger of missing out at present .  WHILE THE SIX Nations has commanded most attention over the past two months , the Guinness Pro12 has teed itself up superbly for a thrilling run-in to the play-offs .  Even the briefest of glances through the upcoming fixture list underlines how many crucial games lie ahead before , and including , the final day of the regular season on 7 May .  Tournament organisers could n't have planned it any better .  Connacht will have to look over their shoulders in coming weeks .

Starting with leaders Connacht when assessing the weeks ahead makes most sense . Pat Lam 's men have been the brightest light in Irish rugby all season and missing out on  By no means is Connacht 's run-in straightforward , but with Lam 's side currently on a five-game winning streak and brimming with confidence and attacking quality , they have every right to be bullish about their chances of securing a home semi-final .  Three inter-provincial derbies in a row is a testing run , though two of them are at home for Connacht . Lam 's men have lost just once in eight league games at the Sportsground this season , a 10-3 defeat to Ulster .  Their try-scoring record -- a remarkable 49 in 17 games , already equal to last season 's entire tally -- is hugely encouraging , even if Connacht tend to ship tries too . Already this season is a major success for Connacht , but there is no reason they can not continue to lead the way and challenge for a trophy .  Luke Fitzgerald is close to making his comeback .

The and has coped well without their many internationals .  The prospect of the likes of the in-form Johnny Sexton , Jamie Heaslip and Devin Toner coming back into the mix in the next fortnight , along with returning injured players like Luke Fitzgerald and Marty Moore is reassuring for Leinster .  Not that those men have been sorely missed all the time . Cathal Marsh endured a tough evening in Glasgow last time out , but others like Garry Ringrose , James Tracy , Dan Leavy and Mick Kearney have performed with opportunity .  With their full contingent of returning Ireland players , Leinster will be keen to make a statement against Munster in the Aviva Stadium on 2 April , but will be eyeing Saturday 's meeting with Connacht as their opportunity to step out at the top of the table .  Ulster have been a beacon of inconsistency , a little like Munster , with their recent record reading WLWWWLLW . As is the theme over the remaining rounds , Les Kiss ' side meet three of their direct play-off rivals in their final five to garner favour with Joe Schmidt , while captain Rory Best and experienced wing Andrew Trimble will be welcome returnees .  Sixth-placed Glasgow are a real threat to Ulster and Munster , as Gregor Townsend 's side find themselves on a good run and with a game in hand still . Winning away to the Warriors this weekend would be a huge feat for the northern province , both on the table and in terms of stifling some of the Scots ' momentum .  Anthony Foley 's Munster are perhaps more in need of their international contingent that any of the other provinces . The return of CJ Stander will be the biggest boost of all for weary supporters , though Conor Murray has also been dearly , dearly missed .  Darren Sweetnam has been given chances in recent times . Source : Ryan Byrne/INPHO  Of their last six games , Munster have won three and lost three , with their performance levels having been far from convincing . Backing against them making the play-offs is certainly justifiable , and Foley must hope the likes of Stander lurking four points behind Munster in seventh place , and with Alan Solomons ' side still to play the Dragons , Zebre and Cardiff , nothing can be taken for granted .  Welcoming Zebre to Thomond Park this weekend could not be any more timely , and a bonus-point win is an absolute must .  Third-placed Scarlets are key players in all of this too , of course , and Wayne Pivac 's men meet both Glasgow and Munster in their own run-in , the latter fixture likely to prove decisive on that final day of the regular season .  While the focus for the Irish provinces is on being part of that top four in order to secure a semi-final spot , it 's worth underlining how the qualification for next season 's Champions Cup works too .  Given the fact that it 's a World Cup season , there will be no inter-league play-offs this time around Connacht lost to Gloucester in last season 's .  The seven highest-ranked Pro12 clubs , based on their regular-season finishing positions , will go into the 2016/17 least one club from each of Ireland , Italy , Scotland and Wales .  If the table was to stay exactly as it is now , then all four Irish provinces would qualify and seventh-placed Edinburgh would have to give up their spot in order to accommodate Zebre , the one Italian club .  However , if Munster or Ulster were to end the season in seventh place , they would need Connacht to win the Challenge Cup in order to rescue their Champions Cup place for 2016/17 .  Without the inter-league play-offs this season , the 20th place in the Champions Cup goes to the winners of the Challenge Cup , which did n't happen last season .  If the Challenge Cup winner has already qualified for next season 's Champions Cup on account of their finishing position in their league , however , then the next highest-ranked club from the same league who has n't yet qualified of course gets in .  Munster will be hoping and expecting that such a scenario will be avoided of course . If Foley 's men can find maintain their positions , we may even have all-Irish semi-finals .  The Scarlets , Glasgow and Edinburgh will have something to say about that , while even the Ospreys might think they have an outside chance .
