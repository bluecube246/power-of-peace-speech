Fidel Castro hits at US aggression in letter to ' Brother Obama '  Tuesday , March 29 , 2016  Fidel Castro responded on Monday to US president Barack Obama 's historic trip to Cuba with a long , bristling letter recounting the history of US aggression against Cuba , writing : " We do n't need the empire to give us any presents . "  The 1,500-word letter in state media , titled ' Brother Obama ' , was Mr Castro 's first response to the US president 's three-day visit last week , in which Obama said he had come to bury the two countries ' history of Cold War hostility .  Mr Obama did not meet the 89-year-old Fidel Castro on the trip but met his 84-year-old brother Raul Castro , the current Cuban president , several times .  Mr Obama 's visit , with his wife and two daughters , was intended to build irreversible momentum behind his opening with Cuba and to convince the Cuban people and the Cuban government that a half-century of US attempts to overthrow its economy and political system without the threat of US interference .  Fidel Castro wrote of Mr Obama : " My modest suggestion is that he reflects and does n't try to develop theories about Cuban politics . "  Mr Castro then goes over crucial sections of Mr Obama 's speech line by line , engaging in an ex-post-facto dialogue with the American president with pointed critiques of perceived slights and insults , including Mr Obama 's failure to give credit to indigenous Cubans and Mr Castro 's prohibition of racial segregation after coming to power in 1959.
