fidel castro hits at us aggression in letter to ' brother obama '  tuesday , march 29 , 2016  fidel castro responded on monday to us president barack obama 's historic trip to cuba with a long , bristling letter recounting the history of us aggression against cuba , writing : " we do n't need the empire to give us any presents . "  the 1,500-word letter in state media , titled ' brother obama ' , was mr castro 's first response to the us president 's three-day visit last week , in which obama said he had come to bury the two countries ' history of cold war hostility .  mr obama did not meet the 89-year-old fidel castro on the trip but met his 84-year-old brother raul castro , the current cuban president , several times .  mr obama 's visit , with his wife and two daughters , was intended to build irreversible momentum behind his opening with cuba and to convince the cuban people and the cuban government that a half-century of us attempts to overthrow its economy and political system without the threat of us interference .  fidel castro wrote of mr obama : " my modest suggestion is that he reflects and does n't try to develop theories about cuban politics . "  mr castro then goes over crucial sections of mr obama 's speech line by line , engaging in an ex-post-facto dialogue with the american president with pointed critiques of perceived slights and insults , including mr obama 's failure to give credit to indigenous cubans and mr castro 's prohibition of racial segregation after coming to power in 1959.
