<p> Mr Martin said the Irish people did not vote for Fianna F ? il and Fine Gael to go into government together . Mr Martin , surrounded by his expanded D ? il party at Leinster House , said the mandate given to him was to change the government . <p> " We did n't get a mandate to go into government with Fine Gael and we certainly did n't get a mandate to put Fine Gael back into government , " he said . <p> However in the D ? il , Fianna F ? il was forced to vote with Fine Gael to prevent a Sinn F ? in motion to scrap water charges being heard in the D ? il . This voting down of the motion was criticised by Sinn F ? in president Gerry Adams . <p> Having failed to be re-elected as Taoiseach by the D ? il , Mr Kenny formally tendered his resignation as Taoiseach to President Michael D Higgins at ? ras an Uachtar ? in last night . <p> A statement released on behalf of the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TD , has this evening conveyed to the President his resignation from office . In accordance with the Constitution , the Government and the Taoiseach will continue to carry on their duties until successors have been appointed . " <p> Following the failure to elect a taoiseach , the D ? il descended into farce as TDs clashed for several hours over how to conduct its business , with new ceann comhairle Se ? n ? Feargha ? l coming under severe pressure from Sinn F ? in and Independents . <p> Fine Gael ministers have confirmed that discussions on behalf of the party will start while Mr Kenny is in the US next week , and contact with Fianna F ? il is expected to take place before he departs . <p> It has emerged that both ministers Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney have cancelled planned St Patrick 's Day trips to Boston and Dubai to take part in potential discussions . <p> The reluctance of the two senior ministers -- both seen as potential leaders of Fine Gael -- to travel , indicates that the party intends to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mr Kenny will be in the US for the national day commemorations and will also attend an EU summit in Brussels next week . <p> Senior Fine Gael sources have also told the Irish Examiner if some spending estimates can not be pushed through the D ? il next month , that the parliament will have to be dissolved . <p> Sources close to Mr Varadkar say parts of spending estimates in the health sector will need to be approved in the coming weeks , but will need agreement in the D ? il . <p> Small parties and Independent TDs have urged Fine Gael and Fianna F ? il to cut a deal with each other . <p> Newly elected TD Danny Healy-Rae and Green party leader Eamon Ryan said the move should be considered for the good of the country and to leave the century-old Civil War firmly in the past .
