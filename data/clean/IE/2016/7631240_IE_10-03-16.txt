Mr Martin said the Irish people did not vote for Fianna F ? il and Fine Gael to go into government together . Mr Martin , surrounded by his expanded D ? il party at Leinster House , said the mandate given to him was to change the government .  " We did n't get a mandate to go into government with Fine Gael and we certainly did n't get a mandate to put Fine Gael back into government , " he said .  However in the D ? il , Fianna F ? il was forced to vote with Fine Gael to prevent a Sinn F ? in motion to scrap water charges being heard in the D ? il . This voting down of the motion was criticised by Sinn F ? in president Gerry Adams .  Having failed to be re-elected as Taoiseach by the D ? il , Mr Kenny formally tendered his resignation as Taoiseach to President Michael D Higgins at ? ras an Uachtar ? in last night .  A statement released on behalf of the Government TD , has this evening conveyed to the President his resignation from office . In accordance with the Constitution , the Government and the Taoiseach will continue to carry on their duties until successors have been appointed . "  Following the failure to elect a taoiseach , the D ? il descended into farce as TDs clashed for several hours over how to conduct its business , with new ceann comhairle Se ? n ? Feargha ? l coming under severe pressure from Sinn F ? in and Independents .  Fine Gael ministers have confirmed that discussions on behalf of the party will start while Mr Kenny is in the US next week , and contact with Fianna F ? il is expected to take place before he departs .  It has emerged that both ministers Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney have cancelled planned St Patrick 's Day trips to Boston and Dubai to take part in potential discussions .  The reluctance of the two senior ministers -- both seen as potential leaders of Fine Gael -- to travel , indicates that the party intends to keep .  Mr Kenny will be in the US for the national day commemorations and will also attend an EU summit in Brussels next week .  Senior Fine Gael sources have also told the Irish Examiner if some spending estimates can not be pushed through the D ? il next month , that the parliament will have to be dissolved .  Sources close to Mr Varadkar say parts of spending estimates in the health sector will need to be approved in the coming weeks , but will need agreement in the D ? il .  Small parties and Independent TDs have urged Fine Gael and Fianna F ? il to cut a deal with each other .  Newly elected TD Danny Healy-Rae and Green party leader Eamon Ryan said the move should be considered for the good of the country and to leave the century-old Civil War firmly in the past .
