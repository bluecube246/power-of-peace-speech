poll finds most people oppose military use of shannon  a poll finding that most irish people oppose the us using shannon airport for military purposes has fuelled calls for taoiseach enda kenny to raise the issue with president barack obama .  with six in 10 people opposing the military use of the airport , the results of the poll will send a stark message to washington in a week where relations are usually cordial between ireland and the us . independent tds mick wallace and clare daly will release further details of the red c poll today . they have renewed calls for an inquiry into how shannon has been used for us military purposes .  initial details of the poll show 57% of people questioned believe that the constitution should be changed to ensure ireland 's neutrality is enshrined in it . however , it also found that the same amount of people oppose the use of shannon by the united states for military transit purposes , the tds said .  mr kenny , now leading a caretaker government , is expected shannon airport with mr obama during the customary st patrick 's day visit to the white house .  a statement from wexford td wallace said that it was imperative now to raise the matter , given the results of the poll . mr wallace claimed ireland had facilitated us missions to afghanistan and iraq , through shannon .  " it 's long past time that ireland stopped facilitating this horror by refusing to allow shannon airport to be used for any military purposes . we need a change of direction . it should start with the new government . it 's time for ireland to work for peace , not war . "  commenting on the results , fellow independent td , dublin-fingal 's clare daly , also said action was needed given the definitive results of the survey .  " a country with a policy of positive neutrality would not facilitate the massive , devastating displacement of tens of millions of people through wars whose only purpose is to keep the gears of the military-industrial complex oiled . "  ed horgan of shannonwatch , a of the airport , said : " shannon airport has been used , or misused by the us military , with the approval of successive irish governments since october 2001 . in the meantime , over 3m armed us troops have transited through shannon on their way to and from wars and military operations in afghanistan , iraq , yemen , syria , and elsewhere . "  mr horgan claims us military aircraft have transported " unknown quantities of munitions and other war materials " through shannon but that the government has repeatedly denied the aircraft are carrying weapons and munitions .  the same poll also found that 57% of respondents want changes made to the constitution , to ensure ireland 's neutrality . however , the department of foreign affairs said permission must be sought in advance for landings by all foreign military aircraft .  " these include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed , carry no arms , ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering , and that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations . the us is fully aware of the need to comply with these strict conditions .
