Scotty T has made the most mortifying faux pas on Twitter  How on earth could this even HAPPEN ?  It 's fair to say , the cast of Geordie Shore are n't renowned for their brains .  They spend a HELL of a lot of time partying , modelling and acting the gobshite so they probably do n't spend too much time catching up with current affairs or television .  One Geordie Shore star who 's after making an absolute tit of himself is Scotty T.  The reality star tweeted a picture of appreciation for one of the world 's biggest models - Kendall Jenner - as she 's known for her style and beauty .  Tweeting " Right ...... you are ridiculously fit @KendallJenner ! #daymmmm #gizalick " the 28-year-old failed to recognise that he had actually been looking at a picture of a similarly stunning beauty , Emily Ratajkowski.
