scotty t has made the most mortifying faux pas on twitter  how on earth could this even happen ?  it 's fair to say , the cast of geordie shore are n't renowned for their brains .  they spend a hell of a lot of time partying , modelling and acting the gobshite so they probably do n't spend too much time catching up with current affairs or television .  one geordie shore star who 's after making an absolute tit of himself is scotty t.  the reality star tweeted a picture of appreciation for one of the world 's biggest models - kendall jenner - as she 's known for her style and beauty .  tweeting " right ...... you are ridiculously fit @kendalljenner ! #daymmmm #gizalick " the 28-year-old failed to recognise that he had actually been looking at a picture of a similarly stunning beauty , emily ratajkowski.
