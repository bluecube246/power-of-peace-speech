DAVID MOYES HAS confirmed that Sunderland have brought in Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj on a season-long loan .  The Belgium international was handed his break with United when Moyes was in charge at Old Trafford , but struggled for game-time under Louis van Gaal .  Januzaj also had an unsuccessful loan move to Borussia Dortmund last season , and the Sunderland boss has confirmed this latest temporary switch in a pre-match news conference ahead of his side 's opener at Manchester City .  " Adnan will give us a different variation , " Moyes said .  " I have to get him back to the level he played at two years ago -- he will get every opportunity to do the business . I 'm hoping the Sunderland fans will see the real Adnan Januzaj . "  The 21-year-old winger will go straight into Sunderland 's squad to face City on Saturday , along with fellow new recruits Papy Djilobodji , Paddy McNair and Donald Love .  Januzaj has so far made 50 Premier League appearances for United , with the Stadium of Light in October 2013 .
