Libyan parliament passes no-confidence vote in UN-backed government  The Libyan parliament has approved a no confidence motion in the country 's UN-backed government .  The development is a major blow to international efforts to resolve the crisis in the deeply divided north African country .  Parliament spokesman Abdullah Ablahig said 101 politicians were present today , enough to reach quorum for the vote . He said 61 supported it , 39 abstained and one member voted to support the government .  It is unclear what happens next . Some politicians claim the vote should automatically dissolve the government set up under a UN deal , while its supporters dispute such a move .  Libya 's parliament is seated in the eastern city of Tobruk , while the government is based in the capital Tripoli .  Libya has been mired in conflict since the 2011 downfall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi .  MP Abdel-Salam Nassiya said the cabinet would now have to be changed to include more representation from Libya 's east .  Galal Saleh , a pro-government politician , said parliament had not announced the confidence vote on Monday 's agenda .  " This is cheating , " he said , adding that the pro-government bloc was invited to meet with opponents for a consultation , not a vote .  A 21-year-old woman who found herself at the centre of a British High Court battle after complaining that she had been imprisoned by her father in Saudi Arabia has yet to return to the UK - despite a landmark ruling by a judge , a lawyer says .
