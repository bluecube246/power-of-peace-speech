http://www.punditarena.com/gaa/bbarry/end-season-hurling-power-rankings/

<p> Champions once again . Just like in 2010 , Tipp look set up to dominate the hurling landscape for years to come . Will that happen this time around ? Who knows ... <p> With young players such as John McGrath , Michael Breen and Seamus Kennedy leading the line for the Premier , and a minor team fresh from an All-Ireland triumph moving up the ranks , these are exciting times for Tipperary . <p> 2 . Kilkenny ( no change ) <p> Where to now for Brian Cody and the Cats ? Beaten by a far superior team , it showed that Kilkenny do not have the strength to match the country 's best teams , fighting fire with fire . Having abandoned their defensive set-up that helped them to the final , the Cats were picked apart . <p> There is hope for Kilkenny , but without an U-21 Leinster title since 2012 there are certainly question marks . <p> 2017 will be interesting . <p> 3 . Waterford ( no change ) <p> The D ? ise are in relatively good shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday will fill them with confidence that they can become the first Waterford side to reach hurling 's promised land since 1959 . <p> They have some of the best young players in the country , a forward-thinking manager who can mix it with the best and a real opportunity in the coming years . <p> 4 . Galway ( no change ) <p> Real question marks hang over Galway . They are comfortably third/fourth in the pecking order , but there is little to suggest that they can finally make the breakthrough . <p> They fell short against Kilkenny in the Leinster final , before giving it everything against a somewhat misfiring Tipperary side in the semi-final . <p> It would appear that the Tribesmen have reached a glass ceiling . <p> 5 . Clare ( no change ) <p> The Banner are more than capable of challenging the established order . Doubt remains whether Davy Fitzgerald will remain as manager . <p> This year , for the first time since 2013 , Clare gave a good account of themselves . The League triumph acts as a timely reminder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 6 . Wexford ( no change ) <p> With promising underage talent coming through , the Yellowbellies are on the up . In Lee Chin and Conor McDonald , they boast two of the strongest hurlers in the country . <p> However , they came up badly short against Waterford in the semi-final , in a tie that was over as soon as it started . They were well beaten by Dublin in Leinster , and must take a scalp in the province next season for more progress . <p> 7 . Cork ( no change ) <p> A lot has been said about the Rebels . A lot more will be said throughout the winter . <p> It is not long ago that these players were challenging for All-Ireland honours . With P ? irc U ? Chaoimh re-opening next summer and Tipperary and Limerick due to honour away commitments , the stage could be set for the Rebels to make a statement . <p> 8 . Limerick ( no change ) <p> 2016 was a disastrous season for the 2013 Munster champions , as tame defeats at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doldrums . <p> However , scores of underage talent coming through suggest the future is bright . First things first ; they need to find the right man for the vacant managerial position . <p> 9 . Dublin ( no change ) <p> The Metropolitans made an early exit from the Championship , but are a Division 1 side with massive talent at their disposal . On their day , the Dubs are capable of mixing it with the very best . <p> A kind draw in Leinster next season could give them momentum . With another Leinster U-21 title in the bag , there is no shortage of talent coming through . <p> 10 . Offaly ( no change ) <p> A promising League campaign was followed by a decent run in the Leinster Championship , and the Faithful have re-established themselves as the province 's fifth best side . However , isolated results do little for the future , and a lot of work needs to be done for Offaly hurling . <p> 11 . Westmeath ( no change ) <p> The highlight of the year was undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right direction , long may it continue . <p> 12 . Laois ( no change ) <p> It was a year of regression for the O'Moore County , as the progress under Cheddar Plunkett hit a speed-bump . <p> Perhaps they are more suited to playing in the Leinster round-robin rather than being inserted straight into the quarter-final . <p> 13 . Kerry ( no change ) <p> The goal at the start of the year was to retain their Liam MacCarthy status , and that was achieved . While they will be disappointed not to have done more , it was a successful year for the Kingdom . <p> 14 . Carlow ( no change ) <p> Relegated , and replaced by Meath for 2017 , it was a poor year for Carlow hurling.
