Photograph : Ryan Byrne/Inpho <p> Gymnastics has been at the centre of Ellis O'Reilly 's world since she was six . But if you 'd told the Londoner back then that 12 years later she 'd become the first woman to represent Ireland in the sport at the Olympic Games , she 'd most likely have thrown you a quizzical look . <p> It has , then , been a dizzying journey for the 18-year-old whose Armagh-born grandfather qualified her for Ireland . Her mother Jackie introduced her to gymnastics when she was six , and she 's been devoted to it ever since . <p> It was a very different sporting route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reggie , and her older sister Jenna , all of whom are boxers . As a four-time British champion , Jenna was given the honour of leading Katie Taylor in to the ring for her gold medal bout at the London Olympics . <h> Local gym <p> So , while her siblings were sparring in the local gym , O'Reilly was making her way to the Europa Gymnastics Centre in Crayford , half an hour away , where she has been coached by Samantha James for almost a decade . <p> As soon as she finishes her days at Chislehurst School for Girls in south London she trains for four hours , between 4.0 and 8.0 , and again on Saturdays , a total of around 26 hours a week . All this while studying for her A-levels , her goal to earn a place at university later this year to study Physical Education . <p> And all this while O'Reilly was attempting to qualify for Rio . The dream began to seem achievable when she finished in the top half of the field at the 2015 World Championships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test Event in Rio , the final qualifying competition for the 2016 Games . <p> She needed 49.134 to qualify and when her scores from the bars , beam , floor routine and vault were totted up she had 50.032 . Still , though , she had to wait an hour to get confirmation that she had qualified , the official list bringing the good news . <p> O'Reilly , then , became the first Irish female gymnast to qualify for the Olympic Games and will join 2012 Olympian Kieran Behan in Rio . Before then , there are those A-levels to sort out . She wo n't forget 2016 in a hurry . <p> Other previous winners : <p> Awards run from Dec 2015 to Nov 2016 inclusive . <p> DECEMBER : Fionnuala McCormack ( Athletics ) -- McCormack just missed out on an individual medal at the European Cross Country Championships in France , finishing fourth , but led the Irish team , completed by Lizzie Lee , Caroline Crowley and Ciara Durkan , to bronze . <p> JANUARY : Aine McKenna ( Basketball ) -- The Kerry woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Cup final when she captained Glanmire club Team Montenotte in their outstanding 96-64 victory over Killester . <p> FEBRUARY : Ciara Mageean ( Athletics ) -- On the comeback trail from a serious ankle problem , the runner from Portaferry , Co Down has had a hugely encouraging few months , securing Olympic qualification and then , in February , breaking two Irish indoor records , the 1,500m and the mile . <p> MARCH : Nina Carberry ( Horse Racing ) -- For the second year running Carberry won the Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham on the Enda Bolger-trained On The Fringe , making it three victories in the race in all , and six career victories at The Festival . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community , including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards .
