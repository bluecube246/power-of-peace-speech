<p> The Australian was full of praise for Hiddink 's achievements -- notably his success with South Korea at the 2002 World Cup -- and revealed that the two had plenty in common : <p> " I was in a similar position of putting a demoralised side back together so we were comparing notes . I picked up three or four really great ideas and that is the great thing . " <p> Where Hiddink has merely steadied the ship at Chelsea , however , Jones has already reversed the fortunes of English rugby by winning the Six Nations in only his first few months in charge . <p> Jones is a follower of football and referenced Liverpool 's extraordinary three-goal comeback against Dortmund last week as an example of why he likes the game . He also mentioned England 's recent 3-2 win against world champions Germany , where he singled out one player in particular that he feels could switch sports and play rugby at a high standard ... <p> " Looking at England 's game against Germany , I thought , the speed and precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , he could play rugby , he 'd be a terrific player . " <p> 20 year old Alli has earned rave reviews for his performances for Tottenham this season -- not only is he the red-hot favourite for this season 's Young Player of the Year award , but he is also likely to be an important part of Roy Hodgson 's England plans at this summer 's European Championships . <p> Jones is not the first coach to suggest that Alli would have made a fine rugby player -- his old PE teacher at school , Tim Hudson , also believed that Alli 's attributes meant he could have been proficient at a number of sports : <p> " Dele was a very able sportsman . It was n't just football he was talented at . He could turn his hand to most sports . <p> " But most of all he was a very good winger in rugby union . He was very quick and nimble , which made him able to dance past defenders very quickly . <p> " Dele has an intelligent brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , he was able to go for that straight away .
