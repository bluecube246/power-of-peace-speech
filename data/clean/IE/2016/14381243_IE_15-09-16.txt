1 . lee keegan ( mayo ) v diarmuid connolly ( dublin )  there 's plenty of history between this pair and more fireworks lie in store if they trot into each other 's path .  keegan and connolly were involved in the semi-final flashpoint that saw the dublin player red-carded last year . connolly was freed on appeal for the replay and the dubs edged over the line .  2 . brian fenton ( dublin ) v seamus o'shea ( mayo )  fenton is a force of nature for dublin at midfield and mayo need to get their match-up right here .  seamus o'shea is arguably their most mobile midfielder and while there 's surely a temptation to drop his brother aidan back to track fenton , seamus is the man who 'll probably go toe-to-toe with last year 's all-ireland final man-of-the-match.  3 . jonny cooper ( dublin ) v andy moran ( mayo )  source : cathal noonan/inpho  moran was exceptional in mayo 's semi-final victory over tipperary but he 's coming up against one of collapse , cooper looks nailed on for an all-star and if he can stop moran exerting a big influence on sunday , he 'll claim the individual accolade and possibly put himself in the frame for the footballer of the year award . moran , however , is one of the best in the business at getting out in front of his man and collecting possession .  expect plenty of ball going in the direction of the veteran forward .  4 . philly mcmahon ( dublin ) v aidan o'shea ( mayo )  source : lorraine o'sullivan/inpho  another pair with history look set to collide at some point in proceedings . mcmahon 's mobility and versatility would see him tailor-made for a man-marking role on one of mayo 's biggest threats .  o'shea can play in a variety of positions but so too can mcmahon . and as we saw when the sides clashed last year , mcmahon 's foraging runs forward caused mayo all sorts of problems . allowing mcmahon free to patrol o'shea would leave the mayo man in a position where he 'll attacking , responsibilities .  5 . keith higgins ( mayo ) v ciaran kilkenny ( dublin )  source : cathal noonan/inpho  higgins is mayo 's man for all seasons and was superb against tipperary in the all-ireland semi-final . mayo boss stephen rochford will surely have noticed how well kerry 's paul murphy did in a man-marking role on dublin play-maker ciaran kilkenny and may well deploy higgins to do a similar job .  kilkenny has been pulling the strings in dublin 's attack this summer but was kept relatively quiet by kerry . still , dublin have so many attacking options that even if three of their six forwards were kept quiet , the other three can cause serious damage and there are also reinforcements to call upon from the bench .  6 . brendan harrison ( mayo ) v bernard brogan ( dublin )  harrison made his senior debut in 2014 and has settled in nicely at right corner back on the mayo team . a player who goes about his business with minimum fuss , harrison continues to grow in stature but  brogan was man-of-the-match in the 2013 final between the counties , scoring two poacher 's goals on the day . he 's a man for the big occasion and will look to expose any potential defensive naivety from mayo .  7 . david byrne ( dublin ) v cillian o'connor ( mayo )  while mayo will hope that brendan harrison can win his patch against bernard brogan , dublin will similarly bank on young david byrne getting the better of mayo 's scorer-in-chief cillian o'connor . with rory o'carroll departed from dublin 's full-back line , byrne has taken the chance to slot in and capture a corner back position , with jonny cooper moving to the central position .  byrne ( 22 ) is already the holder of two all-ireland sfc medals and while the former u21 medallist might be relatively lacking in years , he can still boast plenty of experience . o'connor is a wily forward , however , and after leading the championship scoring charts for the last three seasons , he 's second behind dean rock in 2016 .  thejournal.ie is and
