<p> More than 20 wheelie bins worth of rubbish including syringes , sleeping bags , cardboard and canisters were removed from Stephen 's Green on Monday . <p> The Office of Public Works says Gardai and security teams patrol the Green during the daytime , but it 's battling to deal with people gaining entry to the park after it closes . <p> " Despite the Park 's historic railings , its difficult to secure its perimeter , which extends to 2km , from determined or desperate intruders . Unfortunately , drug use and homelessness are two major social issues that not only effect the day to day management of this popular Park but also the city centre . " <p> The OPW says a team of staff continually clean out all shrubs and bushes on a daily basis , searching for needles other litter . It says despite the difficulties it 's committed to maintaining the park as a first class amenity .
