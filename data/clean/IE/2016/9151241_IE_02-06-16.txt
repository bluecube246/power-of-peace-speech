<h> Dublin city to allow eight storey apartment blocks <h> Decision by councillors allows for building of blocks 5m taller than currently allowed in most of city <p> At 28m the maximum height for most of the city would be half the height of Liberty Hall ( 59m ) . File photograph : David Sleator/The Irish Times <p> Dublin City councillors have approved plans to allow apartment blocks to up 24m , the equivalent of eight storeys tall in " low-rise " areas of Dublin city . <p> The decision means apartment blocks 5m taller than currently allowed in most of Dublin , would be permitted in the new Dublin City Development plan . <p> City council chief executive Owen Keegan had wanted to allow apartment blocks up to 28m tall -- the same height that is currently permitted for office blocks , in " low-rise " areas of the city . Apartment blocks 28m tall would have reached nine storeys . The existing maximum apartment height through most of the city is 19m or six stories . <p> Several councillors wanted low-rise heights to be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic height of the city " or the height of " Georgian terraces " , which are about 14m tall . <p> Mr Keegan urged councillors not to go ahead with these restrictions . " Reducing the definition of ' low-rise ' to the height of typical Georgian buildings . . . would have severe repercussions across the city in terms of employment , international competitiveness , housing provision , together with critical infrastructure such as transport and hospitals . " <p> Andrew Montague ( Lab ) who chairs the council 's planning committee advocated for the 28m limit . " We have to make a choice : do we want to have high rents , high inequality and high homelessness or are we going to do the best for the people we represent . Cities that have restrictions on height have high rents and high homelessness . " <p> People before Profit councillor John Lyons said anyone who believes 28m was low rise had been " spending too much time out in the sun " . <p> Sinn F ? in 's Seamas McGrattan said lowering the proposed heights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I agreed 28m and I have n't seen anything to change my mind . My clinic is full of people who need housing . " <p> Dermot Lacey ( Lab ) said the city planners had always wanted high rise . " They are using the housing crisis as an excuse . " <p> In the previous development plan heights in the " low-rise " categories were expressed in storeys as well as metres . <p> In terms of storeys there was little difference between apartment or commercial blocks : in the inner city low-rise was defined as up to six storeys for residential and up to seven stories for offices ; developments at rail stations could be six storeys for both apartments and offices ; while in the rest of the city low rise was defined as four storeys for both . <p> However , because of the lower ceiling heights of homes as opposed to offices , the use of storeys meant the inner city low-rise apartments could be 19m and offices 28m . At 28m the maximum height for most of the city would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Councillors have not sought reductions of mid- and high-rise areas . Nine areas have been designated as suitable for mid-rise buildings ( up to 50m ) , and four , the Docklands , and George 's Quay , Connolly and Heuston can have high rise buildings in excess of 50m.
