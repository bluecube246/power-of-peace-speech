<h> Montana woman killed baby girl and hid her body in a bin <h> The woman admitted punching the baby on three occasions . <p> A WOMAN BEAT a 13-month-old girl under her care to death on a rural Montana Indian reservation , threw the baby 's body into a bin and reported her missing before confessing to the crime a day later , a federal investigator has testified . <p> Janelle Red Dog , 42 , admitted striking the baby on three occasions , but it 's uncertain if that 's what killed her , her lawyer said . <p> Red Dog got scared after Kenzley Olson died , so she disposed of the body in a trash container several blocks from her house in the town of Poplar , attorney Mary Zemyan said . She later reported the girl missing . <p> Drug epidemic <p> Red Dog appeared in tribal court yesterday on the Fort Peck Reservation , about 20 miles from the US-Canada border , and was ordered back into custody without bond , court officials said . Tribal prosecutors are expected to charge her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was the second major event in recent weeks to rattle the sparsely populated reservation , home to the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes . In late February , a man allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted a four-year-old girl from a park in the reservation town of Wolf Point . The girl was found alive several days later . <p> Fort Peck Tribal Chairman Floyd Azure said Kenzley 's death and the recent kidnapping stemmed from a rising drug epidemic that the reservation must address . <p> " What it 's coming down to is our society is basically allowing this to be the norm , " he said . " We are allowing this to happen by not speaking out . " <p> Investigators have n't publicly linked either case to drugs , but Azure told The Associated Press the use of methamphetamine was at the root of both crimes . <p> Dumpster <p> Bureau of Indian Affairs investigator Ken Trottier testified in tribal court that Red Dog confessed to punching Kenzley several times on Tuesday , killing her , KTMF-TV reported . She then put the girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumpster , he said . <p> A sheriff 's department vehicle is parked outside the house where one-year-old Kenzley Olson was staying when she was beaten to death . Source : Richard Peterson/AP/PA <p> When Red Dog reported Kenzley missing hours later , authorities issued an alert that said the girl was kidnapped , possibly by a man and woman from North Dakota . The pair turned out to not be involved , and the alert was cancelled after Red Dog reportedly confessed and drew a map to Kenzley 's body . <p> Prosecutors filed an affidavit outlining the allegations Thursday , but the chief judge overseeing the case has not released it . <p> Zemyan said Kenzley had been under Red Dog 's care since the girl 's mother dropped her off about two weeks ago and then failed to return . Many details on the events leading up to Kenzley 's death remain uncertain , she said . <p> " The only clear facts are that the baby was found in the dumpster , and Janelle told them where to find her , and that Janelle at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to murder , " Zemyan said . <p> Azure said Kenzley 's mother was in jail when her daughter was killed . That was confirmed by the tribal jail , although the charges against her were not available . <p> Attempts by The Associated Press to reach the mother and other members of the girl 's family were unsuccessful .
