<h> Robin Williams ' widow Susan Schneider marked their wedding anniversary by accepting an award on behalf of her late husband on Saturday night ( 22Oct16 ) . <p> The actor and comedian , who committed suicide in August , 2014 , aged 63 , was posthumously presented with the 2016 Angel Harvey Heart of a Patriot Award by the United Service Organizations ( USO ) . Susan was on hand at the ceremony in Chicago , Illinois , which was held on the same day as the USO of Illinois ' 75th anniversary , as well as what would have been her and Robin 's fifth anniversary . <p> Robin was recognised for his contributions to entertaining troops , as well as being the first ever celebrity to do a tour of duty . <p> In a moving speech as she collected the award , Susan told the crowd : " I 'm here with you tonight because of my husband 's heart . Robin absolutely had the heart of a patriot . I can not think of a more fitting award for him , nor one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of all of you . Robin was also a warrior , and like so many of our finest servicemen and women he had battles to face . <p> " Robin honoured the values woven into the fabric of a soldier 's heart . Loyalty , duty , service and respect - he himself embodied these qualities and this was his connection to the hearts within all of you . " <p> Susan spoke at length about her late husband 's battle with Lewy Body Dementia - a common form of dementia that has similar characteristics to both Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases . <p> As she explained his health struggles , Susan compared them to the journey a soldier goes through . <p> " The parallels in his journey with that of a soldier 's are unmistakable , " she continued . " I imagine many people ca n't begin to understand the intricacies of the battles you 've fought as a soldier , or are fighting now . You may not even know the whole picture yourself , just your current mission . Work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures are so overwhelming - life or death - that you just have to focus on the next right thing . " <p> Now Susan is working to raise funds for brain disease in memory of her late husband , telling the crowd the actor had " brought the light of dawn to a new mission for all of us . That mission is to eradicate brain disease . " <p> " Today is your 75th anniversary , " she concluded . " Today , October 22nd , is Robin and my wedding anniversary too , and there 's no place I would rather be . It feels like Robin wanted me here on this day to celebrate with all of you , with our best man Bobcat Goldthwait , and with our maid of honour Jean Horn . I also think my honey may have wanted me to put on a pretty dress and to just feel the love in this room tonight . "
