" I have lived under threats for years and the only difference is where it is coming from this time , " he said . " It 's criminal gangs that morph under the term dissident republicans . It 's no different to what happens in Limerick and Dublin except they throw the mantle of republicanism over it , but people see through that easily . " <p> Fr Donegan said he has been accused of " collaborating with the state " but the reality is that " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not in discussion with them " . <p> Concern <p> When asked if the threats will affect his work he said , " I will redouble my efforts , if that is possible " . " I am more concerned for the community workers who are trying to further society , especially with young people . I have never cowered from anything in my life . They are picking on the wrong guy . " <p> Bishop Noel Treanor of Down and Connor described the threats as " intolerable " with " no place in a civilised society " . " To intimidate clergy , social and community workers and all those who are working tirelessly and peacefully in the service of their local community , especially those addressing pastoral and social concerns , is a weak and cowardly act on the part of those who themselves are threatened by the prospect and reality of peace , reconciliation and the rule of law , " he said . <p> " The sign of true leadership is to be found in resolving conflict , not in issuing threats .
