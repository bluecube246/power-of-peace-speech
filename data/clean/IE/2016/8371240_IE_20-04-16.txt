<h> Bringing Friel 's Translations back to a Kilkenny audience <h> 24pt Sub Head <p> 20 Apr 2016 <p> 0 <p> s <p> The Barnstorm-Watergate joint production of Brian Friel 's Translations is gearing up for its opening on 27 April . <p> Director Philip Hardy had just founded Barnstorm Theatre Company when he directed the play on the Watergate stage in 1994 , the year the theatre opened . The 1994 programme features an introduction from Ger Cody , Manager of the Watergate , welcoming the production which featured cast from Kilkenny : Ber O ' Hara , Helen Walsh , Ann Widger , Niall Fitzpatrick and Liz Fitzgerald . At that time , Philip Hardy wrote that " the Watergate theatre is a symbol of the ongoing commitment to developing theatre in Kilkenny . " How prescient ! <p> This 2016 production of Translations features actors from the south-east , many of whom are familiar faces from plays presented over the years by KATS Theatre Group , Devious Theatre , Watergate Productions , Barn Owl Players , New Theatre Group and Kilkenny Musical Society , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kilkenny over the last 25 years . The set is designed by Harry Harris , who also designed 1994 's production . <p> Meet the Cast <p> In the first of our Meet the Cast features , three of the 10 actors from Translations give us insights into their acting experiences , their earliest visit to the Watergate Theatre and recall of Leaving Cert plays they studied , some more recent than others ! Translations is a comparative text on the Leaving Certificate English curriculum . <p> Alan Butler <p> Alan plays Lieutenant George Yolland . Alan describes him as a " doomed romantic , very passionate and idealistic and very much a soldier by accident . Yolland always has the best intentions at heart but perhaps sees the world though rose-tinted glasses -- which in the tumultuous setting of 1833 's Donegal in 1883 is not conducive to self-preservation . " <p> Alan grew up in Owning , near Piltown and made his stage debut , as a very unsure 22-year old , as Christy Mahon in Shruggawada Players production of the Playboy of the Western World . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both on stage and back stage -- most recently directing Shadow of a Gunman for KATS Theatre Group . " My first time on the Watergate was in Watergate Productions ' Wild Harvest written by Kilkenny resident Ken Bourke . In another theatrical connection Barnstorm produced Wild Harvest on the Watergate stage back in 1994 , when it was directed by Vincent Dempsey , Barnstorm 's current manager . <p> Alan ca n't recall the first play he attended at the Watergate but he is a now a regular theatre-goer . " I came late to acting but feel we 're lucky in Kilkenny to have so many fantastic local productions -- not to mention the touring companies -- and we 've had some really brilliant plays on our doorstep for years now . " <p> He recalls studying Macbeth for the Leaving Cert and says " I loved it ! The complexity of the characters , the dynamics of their own individual struggles and how much a broad and and complicated situation can be driven by , essentially , base emotions . I was lucky to have a hugely passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English and to act . " <p> Maria Murray <p> Maria Murray has been embedded in the Kilkenny theatre scene from a young age , having worked with Kilkenny Musical Society , Kilkenny Youth Musical Productions , Dreamstuff , Devious Theatre , Little Theatre Company , Equinox Theatre , Trasna Productions . She has appeared in films produced by Mycrofilms and Young Irish Filmmakers . <p> In Translations Maria plays Bridget . Maria says Bridget is " a bit wild . She is always ready to laugh and joke and is comfortable with Doalty , her partner-in-crime , to play tricks on the English soldiers . She loves to hear and tell all the gossip but sometimes she speaks with thinking . While she might be a bit na ? ve she has no problem going toe-to-toe with the exuberant Doalty . " <p> The first play that Maria saw at the Watergate was Silly Bits of Sky , a Barnstorm play for children written by Maeve Ingoldsby but it was n't the best introduction to theatre as Maria was sick that day and " had to sit at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not put her off , and Maria remembers later being very taken with Kilkenny Musical Society 's The Mikado in 1996 . <p> It was not long before she was on the stage with KMS in her debut , Carousel . Maria is no stranger to the Watergate stage since , as she followed that performance with KYMP 's Oklahoma , Calamity Jane and Little Shop of Horrors ; Shruggawada Players ' Colleen Bawn , Romeo and Juliet , 3 Musketeers , Zorro and latterly with Devious Theatre ' s Cannibal the Musical , Trainspotting , Stags and Hens and Night of the Living Dead . <p> Maria works with Equinox , an inclusive theatre company in Callan and toured recently with their play , Memory Box . As she had the joy of sitting the Leaving Cert twice , Maria had a good run at the Shakespeare ; Macbeth the first time , followed by Hamlet . " I found both interesting because both plays had characters that I wanted to play . I loved the idea of reading dialogue that actors had been reading for centuries , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher did well as he kept it interesting . He is a theatre buff too . Hello Mr O ' Leary ! " <p> Paul Derby <p> Although living in Thomastown now Paul Derby , who plays Owen M ? r , has connections with a few places ; he was born in Cork and grew up in Cashel Co Tipperary . <p> Paul 's acting experience in Kilkenny kicked off with the two-year Adult Theatre Club programme at Barnstorm and he then he went on to join Barn Owl Players . The first plays he performed in were the Barn Owls ' productions of Someone to Watch Over Me and Anybody for Tea . He has performed with KATS Theatre Group several times : playing Forrest Gump in the production Spoiler Alert and then , in his Watergate debut , he played Aide Warren in KATS ' One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . <p> " The first play I saw in the Watergate was in 2013 , and it would have been because of the Barnstorm Theatre Club . The Watergate often offered a group rate to drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the venue . The first one I saw was a touring company called Theatre T ? moin with their play , The Fantasist . It was a very physical performance , combing puppetry with acting , using puppetry in a different way to what you would expect . It was interesting . " <p> In a unique take on preparation of the Leaving Cert English text , Paul 's teacher got the class to record a radio play of Philadelphia Here I Come , another Friel play . Paul played Gar O ' Donnell 's father , SB O Donnell , who is referred to as " Screwballs " in the play . Paul says , " I loved the play . The teacher was very inspiring . He was interested in getting a good performance out of everyone . It really gave me an appreciation for the material . " <p> It has served him well , this exploration of Brian Friel 's material . Paul describes his character in Translations . " Owen Hugh is the son of the hedge-school master , Hugh M ? r , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been living in Dublin and appears , on the face of it , to have made something of himself . He returns under the auspices of working as a civil interpreter for the Royal Engineers who are mapping the island , starting with Ballybeg , Owen 's home place . Owen speaks Irish and English fluently , and so he acts as a go-between when communication is required between the locals and the British soldiers . " <p> S ? amus Greene lives in Freshford . S ? amus is from Dublin oringially and started acting at school there . For his Leaving Cert he he studied Othello and Sean O'Casey 's Juno and The Paycock . " My English and drama teacher , Martin Kelly , was brilliant . His classes and rehearsals were always challenging and great fun . I remember thinking that Mr Keating in the film ' Dead Poets Society ' must have been based on him . " <p> S ? amus has taken on the role of Joxer in the O'Casey play but he says of Othello , " I was fascinated by Iago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play him some day . " <p> S ? amus joined Dramsoc in UCD and that was where he really fell in love with acting . <p> He was an active member of St Patrick 's Dramatic Society , Dalkey after college and eventually found his way to Barnstorm 's Adult Theatre Club after he moved to Kilkenny . <p> The first play Seamus saw on stage at the Watergate was John B Keane 's The Field . In Translations he plays Manus , the school-master 's eldest son , who is " effectively an unpaid assistant who runs the hedge-school . He 's a good teacher who cares about his students , particularly Sarah . He loves Maire and they appear to have an understanding , but his sense of obligation to Hugh ruins any hopes of a life with her . " This will be Seamus ' first performance on the Watergate stage . <p> If you wish , you can contact us using any of the methods below : Kilkenny People , High Street , KilkennyEmail : **33;265;TOOLONG : 056 7791000 <p> This website and its associated newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman .
