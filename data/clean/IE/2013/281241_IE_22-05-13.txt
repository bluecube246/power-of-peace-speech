<h> ' It 's been a great year , but I 'd love to see an Irish girl win Miss Universe title ' <h> SHE has a body most of us would kill for , but Miss Universe Ireland , Adrienne Murphy , is hoping her other half can whip her into even better shape . <p> Her boyfriend of six years , Luke Henry , has just finished his personal training exams , and Clondalkin native Adrienne says he 'll have her lunging and squatting in no time . <p> Fitness queen Adrienne Murphy <p> Luke used to be in the Army and , after years of drill training , Adrienne says he 's a bit of a slave driver when it comes to bench-pressing . <p> " Luke has just finished his contract in the Army and he 's gone into personal training now , " she told The Diary . " I 'm delighted for him . He 'll be great at it , and being in the Army will definitely stand him in good stead . <p> " He can get me into shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips and tricks to tone up . He 'll definitely be giving me advice -- he better ! " <p> The 23-year-old model is currently living at home with her parents and , while she 's smitten with Luke , says she has no plans to leave home soon . <p> " I 'm only young -- I 'm a baby really . It 's so cushy living at home , with all the home cooking and comforts . <p> " But I 'm well aware it will get to that stage where I 'll want my independence . My parents were on holiday the other week , and it was so nice having the place to myself . So I know I 'll want to find my own place eventually -- maybe next year I 'll move out . <p> " I hear that , once you 've tried living on your own , you can never go back to living with your parents , so I 'm a little hesitant to make the jump right now . " <p> And Adrienne says she plans on shacking up with Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been together for so long . He 's my best friend and we see each other every day anyway . <p> " He was with me before I started modelling and has been nothing but supportive so , yeah , that 's probably what would happen . " <p> It 's been a whirlwind year for Adrienne -- since being crowned Miss Universe Ireland she has been modelling around the clock and finishing her studies . <p> GRADUIATED <p> " Modelling has been so busy , " she said . " It 's been nonstop since March really . And I graduated from my marketing and advertising degree , so it 's all been go . " <p> It wo n't be long now till Adrienne will have to hand over her coveted tiara and shiny satin sash , and allow another model to take the title of Miss Universe Ireland . <p> But the bubbly brunette says she wo n't miss the role . " It 's been a great year and I 've really made the most of it but , when the time comes to hand over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . "
