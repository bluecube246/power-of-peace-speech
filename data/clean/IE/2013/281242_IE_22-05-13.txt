"  senate minority leader mitch mcconnell has signalled that he will push for passage of the bill put together by four senators from both sides .  " the gang of eight has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward . so far , i 'm told that the judiciary committee has not in any fundamental way undone the agreement reached by the eight senators , so i 'm hopeful we 'll be able to get a bill we can pass here in the senate , " he stated .  a separate bill will likely be introduced in the house where its prospects are still uncertain successful senate negotiations .  if both bills pass then a conference will be called to work out the differences , both houses will vote on the compromise and if it is passed president obama will sign it into law .
