Sometimes I 'm out with my husband or with my friends and I 'm getting pulled over about things .  " It 's too difficult to be accessible every minute of the day . "  Cllr Wynne admitted last night that it is " remarkable " that all three women in the Fine Gael group are stepping down .  " I 've been on the council for seven years now and I really enjoyed it , " she said . " But as you know , elections are very demanding . It 's the right time to say goodbye . I have young grandchildren now to keep me occupied .  CAREER  " However , I will continue to try and help people . "  Meanwhile , Cllr O'Shea , who a decision between council work and her career .  " It 's very hard to find time for both your career and your council work and I had to make a choice , " she said .
