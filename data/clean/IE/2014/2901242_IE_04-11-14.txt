The Florida-based global chain , which has over 13,000 outlets in 79 countries , is planning a grand opening at Select City Walk shopping centre in Saket , New Delhi on November 9 . ( Burger King/Facebook )  And in keeping with the local palette , they 're offering chicken , mutton and vegetable versions of their signature Whopper sandwich on their menu .  However , the move to sell burgers on eBay has certainly puzzled a few Indian consumers , especially when they wo n't delivered to your door in three to five working days . Instead , a voucher will be posted which can then be used to redeem a burger at the outlet in Delhi when they open their doors .
