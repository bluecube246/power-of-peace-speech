Uproar in court at murder verdict  There were unruly scenes at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin last week after Michael Maughan of Stone Court , Ennis , was convicted of murdering Piotr Nowakowski ( peter nova kovskee ) in Ennis last year . Supporters of the accused man shouted abuse at the jury and overturned a bench in the court room . It took the jury under 2 and a half hours to unanimously convict Michael Maughan ( 40 ) of the murder of Piotr Nowakowski at Sandfield Mews in Ennis in July last year . He had admitted manslaughter . The jury heard he stabbed the Polish man twice after they 'd spent the day and night drinking together . In a victim impact statement relatives said his loss is like ' a big sadness taking our soul ' . Maughan 's lawyers offered his apologies and said he really regrets what he 's done . Justice Paul Carney imposed the mandatory life sentence for murder and the court rose . After that there was uproar as a couple of Michael Maughan 's supporters before garda ? intervened to restore order . Michael Maughan , had pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to the manslaughter of Piotr Nowakowski , aged 31 , at Sandfield Mews , Ennis , on July 23 , 2013 . The Central Criminal Court was told that the manslaughter plea was not acceptable to the prosecution and a jury was sworn in for the one-week trial . Maughan had also pleaded not guilty to assaulting Declan O'Dea at the same address on the same date . The jury of seven men and five women found him guilty on both counts by unanimous decision after two hours and 23 minutes . Mr Justice Paul Carney handed down the mandatory life sentence for the murder to run concurrently with four years for the assault . He backdated both sentences to July 24 , 2013 , for time spent in custody . Mr Nowakowski was stabbed twice and died in an ambulance on the way to Shannon Airport , from where he was to be airlifted to hospital in Cork . The court heard that Maughan and his brother had been drinking with that day and returned there that night . He told garda ? he was angry when he was not allowed in . He said he lifted his brother in through a window so he could let him in the front door . Maughan told garda ? that he went into the bedroom where Mr O'Dea and Mr Nowakowski were asleep . After Mr Nowakowski followed him into to the kitchen , he got paranoid and grabbed a carving knife from the counter . He told garda ? he " just went berserk " and he stabbed him twice in the side . The court heard the deceased received several blows and was stabbed before receiving a further kick to the head .
