It has bullets in it and helicopters so obviously they were the best ways to celebrate the release of the film . <p> YouTube masters of destruction RatedRR decided that the movie hitting cinemas was good enough reason for them to introduce some mini-gun spat ballistics to an ordinary car . Something tells me they did n't need much convincing . <p> That 's a Dillon Aero M134D Hybrid Gatling Gun , which in this case was fixed to a chopper and brought to bear on slightly scared looking motor vehicle .
