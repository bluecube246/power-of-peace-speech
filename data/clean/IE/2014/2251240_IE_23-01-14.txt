A Minigun takes on a Car in this Super Slow Motion Video  News  Lone Survivor is a new film starring Mark Wahlberg that focusses on a small group of marines behind enemy lines and in harms was . It has bullets in it and helicopters so obviously they were the best ways to celebrate the release of the film .  YouTube masters of destruction RatedRR decided that the movie hitting cinemas was good enough reason for them to introduce some mini-gun spat ballistics to an ordinary car . Something tells me they did n't need much convincing .  That 's a Dillon Aero M134D Hybrid Gatling Gun , which in this case was fixed to a chopper and brought to bear on slightly scared looking motor vehicle . The results were expected but spectacular , especially when the camera focusses on the gun spitting out individual bullets in super slow motion .  I like it when the car bursts into flames . Like in the movies .  This is probably pretty effective marketing to the target audience of the really very since it released in the States on the 25th of December 2013 .  See it in cinemas in Ireland and the UK from the 31st of January 2014.
