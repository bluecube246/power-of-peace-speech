<h> Andrew Critchlow <p> Falling oil prices could hurt many of the US companies now producing gas by fracking <p> Remember the global financial crisis , triggered six years ago when billions of dollars of dodgy loans - doled out by banks to subprime borrowers and then resold numerous times on international debt markets - began to unravel and default ? <p> Stock markets plunged , banks collapsed and the entire global financial system teetered on the brink of catastrophe . Well , a similarly chilling economic scenario could be set off by the current collapse in oil prices . <p> Based on recent stress tests of subprime borrowers in the energy sector in the US produced by Deutsche Bank , should the price of US crude fall by a further 20pc to $60 per barrel , it could result in up to a 30pc default rate among B and CCC-rated high-yield US borrowers in the industry . <p> West Texas Intermediate crude is currently trading at multi-year lows of around $75 per barrel , down from $107 per barrel in June . <p> " A shock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market default cycle , if materialised , " warn Deutsche strategists Oleg Melentyev and Daniel Sorid in their report . <p> Five years ago at the beginning of what has become known as the US shale oil revolution , drillers started to load up on debt to fund their operations and acquire new acreage as vast areas of North America started to open up for exploration . <p> In 2010 , energy and materials companies made up just 18pc of the US high-yield index - which tracks sub-investment grade borrowers - but today they account for 29pc of the measure after drilling firms spent the past five years borrowing heavily to underwrite the operations . <p> The result of this debt splurge has been a spectacular rise in US oil and gas output . <p> This rush to pump more oil in the US has created a dangerous debt bubble in a notoriously volatile segment of corporate credit markets , which could pose a wider systemic risk in the world 's biggest economy . <p> Should oil prices fall for a prolonged period of time many frackers forced to borrow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately default . According to research from JP Morgan Asset Management , of the 12 largest shale oil basins in the US , 80pc are barely profitable .
