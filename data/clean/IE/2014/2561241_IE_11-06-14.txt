Skull picked up in German antique shop crafted by Leonardo da Vinci  Chemical tests on the materials used are consistent with artist 's involvement  A model skull picked up in an antique shop in 1987 turns out to have been crafted by the great Renaissance artist and anatomist Leonardo da Vinci . Chemical tests on the materials used are consistent with Leonardo 's involvement and there is a close match between errors in the skull and drawings done by the artist in 1508 .  A German couple bought the artefact , a one third model of a human skull . It showed exceptional workmanship and minute anatomical detail , but it took nearly a decade before the possibility emerged that Leonardo was the artist who made it .  Skull expert Roger Saban in Paris linked it to an anatomic drawing RL 19057 , an unpublished work known to have been done by the artist held in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle . Belgian researcher Stefaan Missinne handled the skull and published a scientific paper on its origins in the Springer journal Wiener drawing and the skull share the same small anatomical errors , producing a strong link with Leonardo . This is further strengthened by a chemical analysis done by graduate student Elizabeth Ahner in 2007 .  The skull is made from an agate-based mix of quartz and gypsum , called " mistioni " by Leonardo and invented by him between 1503 and 1509 , writes Missinne . Measurements of iridium in the material showed it was likely sourced in a mine near Volterra , Italy . No other artist was known to have made use of this material .  " The skull was exhibited several times , the last being in Leoben , Austria , and not one negative reaction was expressed on its attribution to Leonardo , " says Missinne.
