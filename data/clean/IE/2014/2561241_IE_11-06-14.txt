skull picked up in german antique shop crafted by leonardo da vinci  chemical tests on the materials used are consistent with artist 's involvement  a model skull picked up in an antique shop in 1987 turns out to have been crafted by the great renaissance artist and anatomist leonardo da vinci . chemical tests on the materials used are consistent with leonardo 's involvement and there is a close match between errors in the skull and drawings done by the artist in 1508 .  a german couple bought the artefact , a one third model of a human skull . it showed exceptional workmanship and minute anatomical detail , but it took nearly a decade before the possibility emerged that leonardo was the artist who made it .  skull expert roger saban in paris linked it to an anatomic drawing rl 19057 , an unpublished work known to have been done by the artist held in the royal collection in windsor castle . belgian researcher stefaan missinne handled the skull and published a scientific paper on its origins in the springer journal wiener drawing and the skull share the same small anatomical errors , producing a strong link with leonardo . this is further strengthened by a chemical analysis done by graduate student elizabeth ahner in 2007 .  the skull is made from an agate-based mix of quartz and gypsum , called " mistioni " by leonardo and invented by him between 1503 and 1509 , writes missinne . measurements of iridium in the material showed it was likely sourced in a mine near volterra , italy . no other artist was known to have made use of this material .  " the skull was exhibited several times , the last being in leoben , austria , and not one negative reaction was expressed on its attribution to leonardo , " says missinne.
