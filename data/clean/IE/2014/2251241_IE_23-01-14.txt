I pulled into the school car park and it was unusually full . Even the space reserved for the disabled was taken . <p> On closer inspection this car had no blue badge displayed and I was quick to learn it was an able-bodied parent who had parked there . Nothing new in that except that the two parking spaces for the principal and vice-principal were empty . Both of these staff were in Bulgaria on a school trip with the primary seven pupils . <p> It amused me that nobody would dare encroach upon the parking spaces of these two teachers even though they were n't in the country , but thought nothing of parking in a spot reserved for the disabled . <p> A similar event happened later in the day at the health centre . Spaces reserved for a doctor remained unused and yet able-bodied people littered the spaces for disabled people . <p> No one seems bothered about abusing the disabled , but abuse an authoritative figure and there would be vilification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda for that day was a speech I had to give in the Long Gallery at Stormont , a privilege and one I 'd been looking forward to . Living in Northern Ireland with a disability was the theme of what I was to talk about and yet in this centre of government they had provided a standard height lectern for me to use . Embarrassing ! <p> Having been invited to speak at another event by Invest Northern Ireland on a topic of encouraging entrepreneurs from the disabled community , I enquired if they had any advisors with a disability who could mentor potential candidates ? <p> This was met with stonewall of comment about how Invest Northern Ireland has great policies to offer services to potential section 75 clients like me . <p> Indicating that the language she was using was unfortunate -- as I was a client with a disability and not a label -- she said that I 'd offended her . A disabled man asking not to be referred to as a section 75 client offended an able-bodied equality officer . Some people know no bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , my invitation to speak would be withdrawn , especially as I feel inclined to mention this in my speech on the day . <p> Sometimes life appears to be improving in Northern Ireland , but it 's never too long before I come back to earth with a bump . I 'm not disheartened and no wall flower . <p> I will continue to point out this discrimination , the ableism riddled throughout society until attitudes change . I hope to be the Rosa Parks of the disabled community .
