" hopefully , we wo n't see you here in these circumstances again . "  keane ( 60 ) told him : " i am well aware i made an awful mistake have learned a lot . i went into hope house for treatment and i have n't had a drink for the last year .  " today is the first anniversary since i had my last drink .

" i got the all-clear , but i had the all-clear before that appointment . i 'm going for the next five years , but every time you .  " i have a message for all motorists and drinkers . drunken driving is totally not on .  stupid  " it 's so stupid . i have missed out on an awful lot because i was so stupid .  " my licence meant an awful lot to me and my family , my son and daughter , and i have missed it .  " it 's a terrible realisation that you just ca n't walk out your front door and get into a car and drive to do the shopping . "  she recalled that she had a new enjoyment in her singing and performed to a packed audience in the salthill hotel outside galway on sunday night , and by monday there were only seven tickets left for next sunday 's show .
