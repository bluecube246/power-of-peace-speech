<h> Paul Krugman : business leaders are not economic oracles <h> Success in business does not seem to convey any special insight into economic policy <p> Ben Bernanke had the courage to defy all those tycoons demanding that they stop printing money . Photograph : Reuters/Jim Young <p> The Bank of Japan , the country 's equivalent of the Federal Reserve , has lately been making a big effort to end deflation , which has afflicted Japan 's economy for almost two decades . At first its efforts -- which involve printing a lot of money and , even more important , trying to assure investors that it will keep printing money until inflation reaches 2 per cent -- seemed to be going well . But more recently the economy has lost momentum , and last week the bank announced new , even more aggressive monetary measures . <p> I am , as you might guess , very much in favour of this move , although I worry that the policy might nonetheless fail thanks to fiscal mistakes . ( More about that later . ) While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so amid substantial internal dissent . <p> In fact , the new stimulus was approved by only five of the bank board 's nine members , with those closest to business voting against . Which brings me to the subject of this column : the economic wisdom , or lack thereof , of business leaders . <p> Some of the people I 've spoken to in Tokyo argue that the opposition of many Japanese business leaders to the Bank of Japan 's actions shows that it 's on the wrong track . In saying this , they 're echoing a common sentiment in many countries , including the United States -- the belief that if you want to fix an ailing economy , you should turn to people who have been successful in business , like leaders of major corporations , entrepreneurs and wealthy investors . After all , does n't their success with money mean that they know how the economy really works ? <p> About that bad advice : think of the hugely wealthy money managers who warned Ben Bernanke that the Federal Reserve 's efforts to boost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many corporate chieftains who solemnly declared that budget deficits were the biggest threat facing America , and that fixing the debt would cause growth to soar . <p> In Japan , business leaders played an important role in the fiscal mistakes that have undermined recent policy success , calling for a tax hike that caused growth to stall earlier this year , and a second tax hike next year that would be an even worse error . <p> And on the other side , the past few years have seen repeated vindication for policymakers who have never met a payroll , but do know a lot about economic theory and history . The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have navigated their way through a **25;525;TOOLONG economic crisis under the leadership of former college professors -- Ben Bernanke , Janet Yellen and Mervyn King -- who , among other things , had the courage to defy all those tycoons demanding that they stop printing money . <p> The European Central Bank brought the euro back from the brink of collapse under the leadership of Mario Draghi , who spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obviously there are business leaders who have gotten the economic analysis right , and plenty of academics who have gotten it wrong . ( Do n't get me started . ) But success in business does not seem to convey any special insight into economic policy . Why ? <p> The answer , to quote the title of a paper I published many years ago , is that a country is not a company . National economic policy , even in small countries , needs to take into account kinds of feedback that rarely matter in business life . For example , even the biggest corporations sell only a small fraction of what they make to their own workers , whereas even very small countries mostly sell goods and services to themselves . <p> So think of what happens when a successful businessperson looks at a troubled economy and tries to apply the lessons of business experience . He or ( rarely ) she sees the troubled economy as something like a troubled company , which needs to cut costs and become competitive . To create jobs , the businessperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced ; in general , belts must be tightened . And surely gimmicks like deficit spending or printing more money ca n't solve what must be a fundamental problem . <p> In reality , however , cutting wages and spending in a depressed economy just aggravates the real problem , which is inadequate demand . Deficit spending and aggressive money-printing , on the other hand , can help a lot . <p> But how can this kind of logic be sold to business leaders , especially when it comes from pointy-headed academic types ? The fate of the world economy may hinge on the answer . <p> In Japan , the fight against deflation is all too likely to fail if conventional notions of prudence prevail . But can unconventionality triumph over the instincts of business leaders ?
