<h> Fancy a gander at Val Kilmer 's son channelling his dad channelling Jim Morrison in new ad ? <p> As much as it pains us to admit it , present day Val Kilmer is a far cry from Ice Man , or Nick Rivers , or Chris Knight , or indeed Jim Morrison ... Time is a cruel mistress and she will catch up with us all at some point . That 's why it 's most considerate of famous sorts to have younger models they can offer the public when the time comes . In saying that , Val 's not scrubbing up too badly for a 52-year-old . <p> Val Kilmer 's Mini Me is his 19-year-old son Jack , who 's just landed the Saint Laurent ad campaign . He 's also a burgeoning actor , do n't you know . He appeared alongside EmmaRoberts in last year 's Palo Alto . <h> Comments <p> I agree that Jack Kilmer is kind of a good looking guy . I guess . He really does n't do anything for me . I guess I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think he looks anything at all like his father . Nothing . I do n't see it . Now I have seen pictured of Val at that age and he was a hottie . This kid , he needs a hair cut . Nothing at all like Val . <p> Posted 21:54 Tue 18th Nov 2014 <h> Log in to leave a comment <h> Disclaimer <p> The opinions expressed in the comments section are those of the viewer and do not reflect those of Entertainment.ie .
