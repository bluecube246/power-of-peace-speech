fancy a gander at val kilmer 's son channelling his dad channelling jim morrison in new ad ?  as much as it pains us to admit it , present day val kilmer is a far cry from ice man , or nick rivers , or chris knight , or indeed jim morrison ... time is a cruel mistress and she will catch up with us all at some point . that 's why it 's most considerate of famous sorts to have younger models they can offer the public when the time comes . in saying that , val 's not scrubbing up too badly for a 52-year-old .  val kilmer 's mini me is his 19-year-old son jack , who 's just landed the saint laurent ad campaign . he 's also a burgeoning actor , do n't you know . he appeared alongside emmaroberts in last year 's palo alto .  comments  i agree that jack kilmer is kind of a good looking guy . i guess . he really does n't do anything for me . i guess i am do n't think he looks anything at all like his father . nothing . i do n't see it . now i have seen pictured of val at that age and he was a hottie . this kid , he needs a hair cut . nothing at all like val .  posted 21:54 tue 18th nov 2014  log in to leave a comment  disclaimer  the opinions expressed in the comments section are those of the viewer and do not reflect those of entertainment.ie . entertainment.ie accepts no responsibility , legal or otherwise , for the accuracy of viewer comments . please contact us to report abusive comments
