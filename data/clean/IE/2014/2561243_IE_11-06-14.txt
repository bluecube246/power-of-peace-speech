" <p> When that $1000 cheque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive - " I called her up to ask if she was dying " ) , he invested in Bitcoin because his older brother had been interested in it , and he wanted to join in . <p> " I honestly did n't think it was going to be an investment at the time , " he said . <p> But his luck held out as Bitcoin started to grow in value -- and peaked when Finman sold his Bitcoins for $1200 apiece to hire his first staff - at exactly the right time . <p> " I honestly thought I made a big mistake when the next day it went to $1300 .

" <p> And he 's still no fan of school - if he makes $1million before he 's 18 , his parents have agreed they wo n't insist on him attending college .
