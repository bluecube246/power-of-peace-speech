VIDEO : Security cam catches runaway FedEx truck , dogs love the show  There 's only one thing worse than having the morning from hell , and that 's having it in front of an audience .  That 's what happened this hapless FedEx driver in the US when after pulling in to kerbside to make a delivery , he forgets to put the handbrake on in his van .  Cue the inevitable , as the vehicle quickly gathers speed while he desperately tries - and fails - to jump in the driver 's door .  The whole situation ca n't have been helped by the over-excited barking of the three dogs in the yard across the street - nor , we imagine , by the fact that security cam footage of the mishap is now spreading like wildfire across the internet.
