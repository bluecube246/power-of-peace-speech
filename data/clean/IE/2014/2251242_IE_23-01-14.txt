Actress -- Ghettoville  Eoin Hennessy takes a look at the knew Actress LP  Almost two years have passed since Darren Cunningham graced us with the beautifully enigmatic R.I.P .. Since then , the Wolverhampton beat maestro has been working on what many believe will be his last album under the Actress pseudonym . Cunningham provided a statement with his new album , Ghettoville , claiming that it " is the bleached out and black tinted conclusion of the Actress image " . The album is also the unofficial sequel to Actress 's 2008 debut masterpiece , Hazyville .  the bleached out and black tinted conclusion of the Actress image  For the follow up to Hazyville , Actress has returned to his Werkdisc roots , however , this time in partnership with London based label Ninja Tune . The result is a murky sixteen track LP full of distortion , hypnotic bass lines and faint bleeps . Ghettoville begins with the seven minute long " Forgiven " . Its sparse and sinister beat is barely audible , serving as the perfect transition between Hazyville " , seems more like the apocalyptic beginning of Ghettoville . Although it contains the normal bleeps associated with the work of Actress , the sounds are more industrial than ever .  The result is a murky sixteen track LP full of distortion , hypnotic bass lines and faint bleeps  Cunningham 's production becomes clear and even slightly more weird than usual . In an interview with The Beat Juice , Cunningham said that the album could be interpreted as " diseased " and that the imagery intended for the album was in some way based upon " mutants " . Tracks like " Corner " , " Time " and " Towers " definitely represent the freakish picture Cunningham was striving for .  the album could be interpreted as " diseased " and that the imagery intended for the album was in some way based upon " mutants "  Cunningham has obviously tried to achieve something different with Ghettoville . A lot of the tracks on the album are quite upbeat , somewhat reminding us of Actress 's 2010 album Splazsh . However , instead of deformed hybrid combining the cloudy sound of Hazyville with futuristic 4 ? 4 beats .  a deformed hybrid  The fourth track " Rims " could be Actress 's mutated take on the music of Flying Lotus , while " Image " sounds like 80 's funk group , Cameo , on acid . Strange echoes like this crop up all over Ghettoville , yet it somehow sounds unbelievably original . The track " Skyline " could even be heard as some sort of freak child created by Daft Punk 's " Around the World " and Joy Orbison .  Strange echoes like this crop up all over Ghettoville , yet it somehow sounds unbelievably original  Ghettoville ends on " Rule " , a three minute-long track of twisted hip-hop , yet again showing off Cunningham 's diversity . A strange send-off to the final Actress outing . However , maybe that 's the point . Darren Cunningham has created yet another amazing record and even if it is the last album he 'll produce as Actress , we should be thankful that he granted us with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
