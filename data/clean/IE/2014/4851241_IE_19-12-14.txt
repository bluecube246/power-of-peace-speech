<h> The sight of big , naked , depilated turkeys sitting up on the countertop like ghostly jurors makes me feel kind of crushed , but , shag it , all in all I 'm grateful <p> ' Christmas : love it or loathe it , we pretty much know that if we have the wherewithal , it 's incumbent on us to step up to the mark and get on with it at the first tinkle of Jingle Bells . ' Photograph : Thinkstock <p> So , it 's happening . Christmas is about to crash down , like a sad drunk into a decorative bay tree . <p> If we 're lucky and fate has left us off the naughty list this year , if we 're not ill or homeless or dispossessed , we 're likely to be looking at another mild and potentially pleasant Yuletide : pine needles in our socks , crocuses pushing through the frosted earth , cats snoozing in front of Father Ted re-runs . <p> By now we fiftysomethings know Christmas like the back of our wrinkling hands . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its alarming habit of catapulting old pain to the surface , its wanton singing and weeping and staggering around under the mistletoe in lino-piercing high heels with its mascara running down its face . And , love it or loathe it , we pretty much know that if we have the wherewithal , it 's incumbent on us to step up to the mark and get on with it at the first tinkle of Jingle Bells . <p> I count myself among the lucky ones , being well-versed in the gentle art of scratching my tinsel-sprinkled scalp and working out how to fit another garland of luminous sausages into the greenish interior of the overcrowded refrigerator . I 'm a dab hand at traversing icy suburban streets , dragging a non-shedding tree behind me and vaguely wondering how best to ignite frostbitten sprouts and excite flaccid parsnips . I 'm one of the lucky ones whose concerns , maybe like yours , have the familiar ring of remembered songs . <p> What sugar-free balm should we offer overtired toddlers who 've just scribbled all over their ugly dollies ? How best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a fistful of Match Attax cards and the Christmas money his granny gave him ca n't buy Taylor Swift ? What 's the most spiteful cure for a hungover spouse ? And what in the name of God are you going to buy for your giddy mother-in-law ? Child 's play , that stuff : a walk in the park . <p> An acquaintance of mine , an easygoing chap prone to mismatched socks and driving well within the speed limit , and his wife , who is entirely more frosted and angular , received an unusual Christmas gift request from his mother-in-law . No longer satisfied with a bar of lavender-scented soap , a Johnny Mathis CD and a set of handmade coasters ( oh , what clever use of old jam-jar lids ) , she asked the couple for donations to her plastic-surgery fund . <p> We were standing at the supermarket counter , he and I , watching the tattooed forearm of the paper-hatted butcher slap a pork belly on to his block and raise the chopping knife . <h> Grotesque caricatures <p> " Jerry Hall says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery , " I told him . " She says they do n't fool anyone . She says women who go under the knife look like pathetic , insecure creatures . Unless you 're in Hollywood , that is , where it 's an industry staple and you wo n't get as much as a voiceover of an animated turtle unless you 've had your chin stapled to your eyebrows . " <p> " My mother-in-law lives in Raheny , " he said , looking glumly at a tray of pimpled chicken thighs . " She only went to Florida the once . Do you have any idea how much a rhytidectomy can set you back ? " <p> I did n't , but I left the supermarket cheered up by the thought of the cussed old woman , still lively enough to annoy her children with her vanity . <p> I 'm looking forward to Christmas this year . Do n't get me wrong : you wo n't find me festooning my home with rubber snowmen , and , believe me , I 'd rather bathe in turkey giblets than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks assembling the ingredients for a Christmas pudding . Also , the sight of big , naked , depilated turkeys sitting up on the countertop like ghostly jurors makes me feel kind of crushed -- but , you know , shag it , all in all I 'm grateful . Grateful that I dodged the bullets for another year , grateful that when fate was handing out the short straws , I pulled a long one . <p> Over the course of two days this week , I attended a memorial service for an old friend and , the following day , went to the funeral of another . Both were pulled from their lives far too soon . Both had plenty of living yet to do , and both left such tender sorrow in their wake . <p> I 'll be toasting absent friends this year , and enjoying the gift of arbitrary good fortune , no matter that it 's wrapped up in leftover tinsel , no matter that grief waits quietly beyond the door . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community Standards .
