Robert Plant says there is ' ' zero chance ' ' of a Led Zeppelin reunion  Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant has scotched any possibility of the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reforming , saying that there is " zero chance " that the legendary rock act will tour ever again .  The three surviving members of Led Zeppelin - Plant , Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones - last performed together in 2007 at a special charity concert for the founder and president of Atlantic Records Ahmet Ertegun but it now appears that the several thousand crammed inside The O2 in London that night will be the last souls to ever witness a Led Zeppelin live performance .  Speaking to the BBC , Plant said : " I 'm sure people would love to hear it . " He cryptically added , " I 'm not the one to be asking , I do n't sing . "  When pushed , Plant admitted that the chances of another reunion show is " zero " .  Led Zeppelin will reissue their first Plant 's bandmate Jimmy Page has spent the last two and a half years working on the reissues , saying that he does nt ' " want to die and have someone else do it . I 'm authoritative about what was done in the first place . "  " These things are n't to study , " he added . " They 're to turn up very loud and say , hey , once upon at time , everything was just as easy as this . "
