? 2.5m floating pool and urban beach plan is scaled back  PLANS for a ? 2.5m floating swimming pool on a converted barge in Dun Laoghaire harbour have been scaled back following objections .  The Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company ( DLHC ) is proposing to build a pool containing heated and treated seawater at the town 's east pier .  Victor Boyhan  The barge would also house an urban beach . The concept is modelled on the Badeschiff facility in Berlin , Germany .  Provision is made for changing and toilet facilities , a cafe , an administration area , and entrance and security features .  Following concerns raised by Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown Council planners , the company submitted revised designs .  The harbour company said the latest proposals would see a reduction in the development area of 15pc , with the number of " pod structures " housing the different elements of the scheme going from eight to five .  " In order to further minimise the visual impact the height of the structures have ( also ) been height of the proposed facility has been reduced by revising the roof pitch , which has resulted in a reduction of height of up to one metre . "  However , independent councillor Victor Boyhan said he did not see anything in the additional information to convince him to drop his objections .  " The feeling is that it is not an appropriate place for a thing like this , " he told the Herald .  opposed  " The people I know who are objecting are committed to appealing it to An Bord Pleanala ( if permission is granted ) . There is a general feeling among the public that it is not the right place , " he added .  He is also opposed to plans by the local authority to part-fund the scheme with a contribution of ? 1m .  Mr Boyhan said the council should instead be putting money into restoring the derelict Dun Laoghaire Baths site , which has been an issue for " some 30-odd years " .  If approved , the floating pool could attract 140,000 visitors a DLHC believes .  Tim Ryan , operations manager with DLHC , has said : " The development of a floating swimming pool and urban beach is an exciting element of the masterplan for Dun Laoghaire Harbour . "
