" we apologize to applicants and recognize this may cause hardship to applicants waiting on visas and passports . we are working to correct the issue as quickly as possible , " harf said .  estimates starting at 50,000 in one country alone , the total may be in the millions . last year , the number of visas issued by embassies abroad exceeded 9 million , and the summer months bring an uptick in applications .  the " glitch " has inconvenienced everyone from celebrities traveling in and out of the us , to parents waiting to take home their children adopted overseas , to visitors waiting to enter the us .  actor daniel radcliffe , who recently wrapped up a broadway revival of martin mcdonagh 's " the cripple of inishmaan , " was turned away last friday at the us-canadian border when he attempted to re-enter the country after the opening of his new film , " what if , " in toronto .  the telegraph reports that he was between visas , having just been approved for the o-1 visa , but was not able to receive the necessary stamp from the us embassy in toronto because of the backlog . radcliffe has since returned to the u.s.  in ireland , people waiting for visa approval from the chaotic . one man , who wished to remain anonymous , told irishcentral that he had been approved for his visa over a week ago and was still waiting -- not only for the visa , but also for his passport to be returned .  yesterday the embassy sent out the following email , noting " if you have travel planned in the near future , we would suggest adjusting your travel arrangements accordingly . "  " the department of state bureau of consular affairs is currently experiencing technical problems with our visa system which are affecting operations globally . we recognize that this may cause inconvenience to travelers , and apologize for the delay .  " although we have completed adjudication of your visa application , we are unable to take final action on the visa at this time . we hope to have our system fully operational again soon , but currently we do not have a timeline for when this may happen . if you have travel planned in the near future , we would suggest adjusting your travel arrangements accordingly .
