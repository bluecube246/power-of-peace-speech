the system , dubbed vibrative , uses the three-dimensional accelerometer in apple 's smartphone to measure the characteristics of each tap on the table , such as the strength and frequency of the vibrations it causes , and compares them to " training data " to work out its approximate location .  the location is converted into a key press on the " virtual keyboard " . currently , the system determines the intended key correctly about 80 per cent of the time , so the data is also fed into an auto correct dictionary to ensure the words are spelled correctly .  " the signals i 'm collecting are very weak , " said florian kraeutli , a computing student at goldsmiths , who created the system as part of his work on user interfaces .  " at the moment it 's more of a proof of concept but if you made the accelerometer more sensitive you could improve the accuracy quite easily . "  he suggested that accelerometers in smartphones may be set to be less sensitive than they are capable more accurate on smaller surfaces , which vibrate more with each tap .  the system needs to learn the vibration patterns for each surface on which it is used , but does not necessarily need to be taught the patten for each key individually .  " ideally you would train each key , but you can do just a couple , " said mr kraeutli .  in a video demonstrating the technology , mr kraeutli uses a " keyboard " printed on an ordinary piece of paper to train vibrative and then type a text message . he also shows the paper is unnecessary for a touch typist , once the system is trained , by typing directly onto the wooden table beneath .
