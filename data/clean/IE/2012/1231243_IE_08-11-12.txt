The system , dubbed Vibrative , uses the three-dimensional accelerometer in Apple 's smartphone to measure the characteristics of each tap on the table , such as the strength and frequency of the vibrations it causes , and compares them to " training data " to work out its approximate location .  The location is converted into a key press on the " virtual keyboard " . Currently , the system determines the intended key correctly about 80 per cent of the time , so the data is also fed into an auto correct dictionary to ensure the words are spelled correctly .  " The signals I 'm collecting are very weak , " said Florian Kraeutli , a computing student at Goldsmiths , who created the system as part of his work on user interfaces .  " At the moment it 's more of a proof of concept but if you made the accelerometer more sensitive you could improve the accuracy quite easily . "  He suggested that accelerometers in smartphones may be set to be less sensitive than they are capable more accurate on smaller surfaces , which vibrate more with each tap .  The system needs to learn the vibration patterns for each surface on which it is used , but does not necessarily need to be taught the patten for each key individually .  " Ideally you would train each key , but you can do just a couple , " said Mr Kraeutli .  In a video demonstrating the technology , Mr Kraeutli uses a " keyboard " printed on an ordinary piece of paper to train Vibrative and then type a text message . He also shows the paper is unnecessary for a touch typist , once the system is trained , by typing directly onto the wooden table beneath .
