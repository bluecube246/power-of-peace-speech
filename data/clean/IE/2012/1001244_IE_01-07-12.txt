" In addition to directing Ted , he also wrote and produced the movie and voiced the titular role , a ( foul-mouthed ) talking teddy bear .  " I 'd actually love to see him in front of the camera , as well , " Wahlberg said of MacFarlane . " He 's a really funny guy and an amazing actor . I was kind of surprised and jealous on a daily basis at what he is capable of doing and how good sic he does it . "  Mila Kunis , Wahlberg 's co-star in Ted who has also worked with MacFarlane on ' Family Guy , ' heaped similar praise on her director , according to the Belfast Telegraph .
