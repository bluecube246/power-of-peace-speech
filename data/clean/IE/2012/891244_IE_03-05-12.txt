" security is a big issue in football , especially in this league used to be . so to sign a two year extension on top of this year is great .  " playing for shamrock rovers is an honour , so to know i 'll be doing it for another two years is great . when you come here you realise how big the club is and once you 've played here , you do n't want to leave . "  commenting on the re-signing , kenny said : " i am delighted that ronan has extended his contract here . he is an integral part of the future of shamrock rovers and i 've been very impressed by him since i joined the club .  " actually one of the things that has impressed me most since i become manager of shamrock rovers is ronan finn and the talent he possesses .  " it is unique to have a central midfield player who can dribble at pace off either foot . there have n't been many players like that in a central midfield position in the league . it 's very exciting and as he gets stronger , full potential has yet to be realised , he can go on to be the most influential player in the league with the talent that he has . ronan 's application is first class and he has huge desire to improve . it is great news for our club that he is going to remain here .
