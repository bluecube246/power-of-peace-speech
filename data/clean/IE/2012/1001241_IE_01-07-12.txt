the banking collapse was not your fault . it was an awful mistake . you did not lend recklessly . you are perfectly fit to run a bank .  on thursday the central bank gave the all-clear to the surviving ghosts of the banking holocaust , the bankers who came through the 2008 massacre of ireland 's banks , the slaughter of small shareholders , the penury of taxpayers and the crippled irish economy .  two guys who sat tight through the disaster , in which they were active participants , have been told to continue doing what they do worst -- run bankrupt banks .  richie boucher , chief executive of bank of ireland , and kevin murphy , retiring chief executive of irish life , have been cleared by the central bank as suitable guys to continue in the careers which they have pursued with such disastrous consequences for ireland .  no one is saying that either boucher or murphy are dishonest . far from it . but they are rich , very rich . boucher receives a ? 690,000-a-year package armageddon of 2008 .  while boucher and murphy became millionaires , their shareholders were being ruined . bank of ireland 's share price has fallen from over ? 18 to friday 's level of just nine cent . their dividends are no more .  boucher was a director throughout the collapse . he was chief executive while much of the slaughter of his innocent shareholders was happening .  irish life 's share price fell from a high of ? 22.80 in 2007 to friday 's level of just two cent while kevin was a director . a board member since 1999 , he was made chief executive in june 2009 . the central bank has found that the duo are appropriate people to stay in the saddle .  boucher 's dismal career at the b of i merited an early bath in 2008 -- immediate retirement without a six-figure compensation package . instead , he was promoted . he became the overall boss in 2009 . his appointment was described by current minister joan burton as " a missed opportunity to signal a new development in the guard .  he said boucher must have been responsible for " serious errors of judgment , including advancing loans to developers on the strength of overstated land values and insufficient security " .  desmond 's fears were borne out . the share price has tanked under boucher .  boucher joined bank of ireland in 2003 and was made a full board director in 2006 . he was head of b of i 's irish retail division and oversaw much of its land bank and development loans when they grew to ? 7.1bn . there is no record of him ever having held up his hand against the property madness .  ' sean fitzpatrick and michael fingleton are perfectly fit to run banks '  less than three months before september 30 , 2008 -- the day of disaster -- boucher told an oireachtas committee : " unequivocally , we do not think that there is a northern rock in ireland . "  he went on : " we do not believe that we have capital problems . the issues that we face are more down to former financial regulator paddy neary , who claimed that all the irish banks were well capitalised , even as the foundations of the financial system were visibly shaking . paddy lost his head for his trouble .  the central bank launched its review of bank directors , painting itself as the regulator that was going to change the system .  it was expected to clear out those who shared responsibility for the fiasco leading up to the property/banking collapse .  none have faced penalties . some have been rewarded with massive redundancy packages . the survivors have been found fit for office .
