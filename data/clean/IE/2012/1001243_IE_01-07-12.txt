No leprechauns in the Nation of Paddy

<h> In this brave new world , the Irish male would renounce all eejitry , writes Declan Lynch <p> I read with sadness the words of my friend and colleague Dion Fanning , reflecting on the terrible things he had seen at Euro 2012 : " many might insist that the ease with which we now dress as leprechauns or some other mythical representation of the eejit shows a nation at ease with itself ... yet there is no evidence that we are at ease with anything , except when assisted by massive doses of alcohol or other sedatives " . <p> He imagines a Million Man March , in which the Irish male displays a commitment to sobriety and a renunciation of eejitry , asserting the values of self-respect and dignity , rather than whatever he is asserting in his present condition -- sort of an anti-St Patrick 's Day Parade . And if you think about it , for a long time , you can indeed imagine such a thing , and what it might mean . <p> No doubt Malcolm X and the Nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free their black brothers in so many ways , not least to free them from their enslavement to alcohol and drugs , which were keeping them down just as the white man had done . Perhaps it is time for us , my friends , to be envisioning a Nation of Paddy , the suits , the dark glasses , even the sobriety . <p> Because Paddy is now on his own . If he thinks that the Irish ruling class will do anything for him , he is gravely mistaken . If we are being charitable , we will describe the Irish ruling class as talentless . If we are being honest , we see them as disgracefully stupid and profoundly corrupt . Much given to eejitry too , in their own way . <p> Face it , Paddy , you will be making this journey alone . And it will not be easy . But there are attractions along the way . The next time that you and your brethren from the Nation of Paddy go to a major football tournament , you may encounter a situation such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfits rolling drunkenly around the town square , thinking they 're great . And there will be men like you , dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses and demonstrably not drunk . <p> I wonder which of these would be more appealing to women ? <p> Then again , Paddy has traditionally used his alcoholic eejitry to take himself out of the battle of the sexes , out of that whole area in which he is deeply uncomfortable . In foreign fields in particular , with his green bodhran-banging , he is saying : " do n't mind me ladies , I am just an eejit . The Italians are over there " . <p> If he sobered up , it would be a terrifying prospect , but the results could be spectacular . Darker forces in our culture have always known that if Paddy could only free himself from drink and eejitry , he would be a man to be reckoned with . So they have subverted that great longing for a better life , to their own ends . <p> The Catholic Church got in there in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereby if you stayed off the drink you would get points for heaven , a sort of a reward card that you could cash in after you were dead . The Church knew that fellowships such as Alcoholics Anonymous have a certain spiritual dimension , and they did n't want to lose their grip on Paddy in that way . So they had their own version , in which they could divert him away from such dangerous areas of enlightenment , and have him walking around in a state of white-knuckle sobriety wearing a pin in his lapel . Supposedly it made him feel morally superior , but deep down he was still a prisoner . They still had Paddy where they wanted him . <p> Interestingly , in the 1830s , Fr Theobald Mathew had started quite well , making common cause with the former slave Frederick Douglass when that campaigner for the abolition of human bondage visited Cork . And , of course , Paddy took the Pledge in vast numbers , excited by the prospect of freeing himself from the oppression of his lord and master John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equally interestingly , when Fr Mathew visited America to spread his otherwise excellent vision , he did not speak in favour of the abolition of slavery for fear of upsetting his powerful friends . <p> In more recent times , the corporate class came up with its own garbled version of a liberated Paddy , one who could indeed be seen wearing a suit and even dark glasses and who was anxious to let everyone know that he got up early in the morning , feeling refreshed . But in that anxiety we could sense yet again that Paddy was not <p> free . He was just pumped up with a new brand of bullshit , addicted now to the money game and to vainglorious notions of having the green , white and gold flying proudly over the great buildings of London . Those guys wanted to be " characters " too , they wanted everyone to know that you 'll never beat the Irish . They did n't realise that nobody gave a damn . It was , in the end , just more eejitry . <p> They will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This is about you , and you alone . And yet there are a million others just like you , in this Nation of Paddy . Rise up now , Paddy , rise up .
