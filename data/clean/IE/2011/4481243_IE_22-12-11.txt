Opinion: Five Digital Security Predictions for 2012
http://sociable.co/technology/opinion-five-digital-security-predictions-for-2012/

<p> Williams believes that digital security risks will not just threaten on our personal information but could threaten lives and livelihoods . This is n't scaremongering but a recognised threat ; this year the US Department of Defense announced its rules of engagement for cyber threats , they said , " Cyber threats continue to grow in scope and severity on a daily basis . More than 60,000 new malicious software programs or variations are identified every day threatening our security , our economy and our citizens . " <p> Hacking will cause loss of life Throughout 2011 we have seen an increase in targeted cyber-attacks , and a number of high profile incidents involving critical infrastructure . Many of these were suspected to be state-sponsored . In 2012 I expect this type of attack will not only continue -- but that given the type of systems being targeted , we will see at least one incident where direct loss of human life results . <p> Export controls introduced for " lawful intercept " hacking tools Want to export a nuclear missile to a " rogue state " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you ca n't . Ditto for a long list of munitions , stun guns , ' dual use ' materials and much more . Various computer security products -- especially those containing strong encryption -- are likewise prohibited from sale to those who the USA and its allies consider a threat to world peace . But bizarrely , the sale of computer technology designed to defeat computer security is not controlled in this way . So while it is illegal to sell software to those fighting for democracy in various states , supplying their governments with technology that allows their secret police to spy on private citizens is perfectly legal . Hopefully 2012 will see export controls updated to remedy this bizarre double standard . <p> Ever more sophisticated mobile threats emerge Imagine if you could track the movements of an individual of interest to you anywhere they went . Or read their email messages , spy on their SMS messages , maybe even remotely eavesdrop on their conversations or take a few undetected photos or video clips from far away . Orwellian nightmare ? No , this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malware . We 've already seen a banking trojan which can infect both your PC and your mobile , in order to capture your online banking credentials AND any one-time PIN being sent to you by SMS . This is just the tip of the iceberg and for 2012 I predict that some of the most audacious and intrusive of all cyber attacks will be those targeting mobile devices . <p> Trust in digital certificates gets undermined Users rarely think about digital certificates as they are hidden away in the ' plumbing ' of their daily electronic communications . The most that a typical user may be aware of is that the ' padlock ' symbol in their browser indicates their communication is with a confirmed entity and is secure as it traverses the internet . But is it ? 2011 saw multiple instances where compromises of certificate authorities ( " CAs " ) allowed attackers to issue fraudulent certificates ( Comodo and DigiNotar for instance ) . I fear that the CA business will suffer an increasing number of cyber attacks -- something it is vulnerable to because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Firefox ) recognise over 50 root certificates , and the Electronic Frontier Foundation has mapped over 650 CAs which major browsers trust directly or indirectly . Secure web communication via the HTTPS protocol is only as strong as the security of the weakest of this myriad of CAs and attackers have many targets to choose from . Further CA compromises will severely test trust in the whole digital certificate system . <p> Microsoft software patches move from monthly to weekly " Patch Tuesday " is the monthly event -- normally the second Tuesday of the month -- which sees Microsoft release security updates to remedy the most recently discovered security vulnerabilities in their products . The intention is to fix flaws before attackers have time to actively exploit them . But with a greater scramble by hackers to exploit flaws before patches are released and widely deployed , I think 2012 may see Microsoft start to release their patches with greater frequency , perhaps weekly .
