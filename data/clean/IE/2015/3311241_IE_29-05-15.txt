Photograph : Reuters .  Heavy fighting erupted in southern Yemen near Aden airport on Friday when a Sunni Muslim militia attacked Shi'ite Houthi rebels in a push to drive Houthis from the district .  Saudi-led forces also made four air strikes on a military base near the airport , a source in the southern militia said .  A Saudi-led coalition began air strikes in Yemen on March 26 in a campaign to restore Yemeni president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power . He fled in March , after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa in September and is Yemen 's commercial hub . Its airport has been closed since fighting began but its port provides sporadic access for desperately needed humanitarian aid to enter the country .  Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh are concentrated around Aden 's districts of Khor Maksar , Crater and Moalla .  The fighting in Khor Maksar has killed four southern militia fighters and 15 Houthis so far , a militia source said .  Intense air raids by the Arab alliance were also reported overnight by residents of Saada province , which borders Saudi Arabia in northwestern Yemen . Raids also targeted a weapons storage site in Sanaa , said residents .  On Monday , Houthi fighters suffered their first significant setback in the south in two months of civil war when local Sunni militia ejected them from much of the southern city of Dalea , about 170 km north of Aden .  The Sunni militias , who call themselves the Southern Resistance , are a loosely allied group of fighters who took up arms against the Houthis .  UN-sponsored peace talks set because of the heavy fighting .
