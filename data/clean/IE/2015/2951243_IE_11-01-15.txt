gareth bale booed during real madrid match for not passing to ronaldo  the welshman showed major cajones to deny the madrid faithful a goal from their talismanic striker  bale came under fierce criticism from madrid fans at the bernab ? u on saturday after he had the temerity to take a shot when clean through on goal instead of squaring the ball to cristiano ronaldo . the welshman endured a chorus of boos from the stands as his strike sailed harmlessly wide of the target .  ronaldo also appeared to be belligerent after not being allowed to finish off what would have been a certain goal . the striker looked visibly displeased with bale following his wasted opportunity .  madrid boss carlo ancelotti agreed that selflessness was a vital part of the club 's ethos but admitted that he did not criticise bale for going for glory .  bale has played a very , very good game . he 's played with intensity and he 's scored .  it could be that at that moment the fans have asked for a like all strikers who are in front of goal he tried to score .  altruism is a very important component of the team this season . if there is any play which seems selfish we 'll clearly fix it . we have fans who demand a lot . bale is a fundamental player like cristiano and for that the fans demand much more than of others .  despite scoring a goal in the 3-0 win over espanyol , it is difficult to tell at this early stage whether the fans will ever forgive bale for committing what is considered high treason in the bernabeu.
