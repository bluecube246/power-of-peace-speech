<h> Gareth Bale booed during Real Madrid match for not passing to Ronaldo <h> The Welshman showed major cajones to deny the Madrid faithful a goal from their talismanic striker <p> Bale came under fierce criticism from Madrid fans at the Bernab ? u on Saturday after he had the temerity to take a shot when clean through on goal instead of squaring the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo . The Welshman endured a chorus of boos from the stands as his strike sailed harmlessly wide of the target . <p> Ronaldo also appeared to be belligerent after not being allowed to finish off what would have been a certain goal . The striker looked visibly displeased with Bale following his wasted opportunity . <p> Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti agreed that selflessness was a vital part of the club 's ethos but admitted that he did not criticise Bale for going for glory . <p> Bale has played a very , very good game . He 's played with intensity and he 's scored . <p> It could be that at that moment the fans have asked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like all strikers who are in front of goal he tried to score . <p> Altruism is a very important component of the team this season . If there is any play which seems selfish we 'll clearly fix it . We have fans who demand a lot . Bale is a fundamental player like Cristiano and for that the fans demand much more than of others . <p> Despite scoring a goal in the 3-0 win over Espanyol , it is difficult to tell at this early stage whether the fans will ever forgive Bale for committing what is considered high treason in the Bernabeu.
