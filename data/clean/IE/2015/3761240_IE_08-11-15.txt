samuel l. jackson : i 'm not worried about winning an oscar  the ' django unchained ' star has confessed he was gutted when he missed out on the academy award after being nominated for ' pulp fiction ' but insisted he 's not bothered anymore .  he said : " some people only do movies that are meaningful and that are going to come out during academy awards season , but i 'm not that person . i 've done enough work now not to worry about getting an academy award .  " when i got nominated for ' pulp fiction ' i kept going to all of these f**king award shows and i was n't winning and it 's kind of like , ' god dam , what is going on ? ' by the time we got to the academy awards i thought to myself , ' maybe they 'll get it f**king right this time ' . when they did n't call my name i just went , ' s**t ! ' and everybody in tv-land read that on my only person to have an honest reaction to not f**king winning . "  the 66-year-old actor also claimed he would never go to the same lengths oscar winners do to promote his own films in an attempt to bag a prestigious award .  he explained to british gq magazine : " these actors would like you to believe that it 's truly based on the merit of what they 've done in the film , and occasionally it is , but most of all it 's the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people , who go everywhere to promote it .  " you go to the actor 's home and you make sure there are copies of the film that you 're in and you have a discussion with them , watch it with them , have a talk about it or go to the post-screening discussions . i ai n't doing that .
