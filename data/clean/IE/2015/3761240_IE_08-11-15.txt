Samuel L. Jackson : I 'm not worried about winning an Oscar  The ' Django Unchained ' star has confessed he was gutted when he missed out on the Academy Award after being nominated for ' Pulp Fiction ' but insisted he 's not bothered anymore .  He said : " Some people only do movies that are meaningful and that are going to come out during Academy Awards season , but I 'm not that person . I 've done enough work now not to worry about getting an Academy Award .  " When I got nominated for ' Pulp Fiction ' I kept going to all of these f**king award shows and I was n't winning and it 's kind of like , ' God dam , what is going on ? ' By the time we got to the Academy Awards I thought to myself , ' Maybe they 'll get it f**king right this time ' . When they did n't call my name I just went , ' S**t ! ' and everybody in TV-land read that on my only person to have an honest reaction to not f**king winning . "  The 66-year-old actor also claimed he would never go to the same lengths Oscar winners do to promote his own films in an attempt to bag a prestigious award .  He explained to British GQ magazine : " These actors would like you to believe that it 's truly based on the merit of what they 've done in the film , and occasionally it is , but most of all it 's the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people , who go everywhere to promote it .  " You go to the actor 's home and you make sure there are copies of the film that you 're in and you have a discussion with them , watch it with them , have a talk about it or go to the post-screening discussions . I ai n't doing that . "
