<h> Denis Guiney snatched it from the jaws of death but his ethos of giving shoppers a bargain died when he did , writes Liam Collins <h> Liam Collins <p> SHOPPING MECCA : Clerys pictured in 1924 , two years after it reopened after the RisingSHOPPING MECCA : The original Clerys drawings of 1898SHOPPING MECCA : Denis Guiney who bought the Clerys store for ? 230,000 <p> Although it was incorporated in 1898 as ' Clery &amp; Company Ltd - General drapers , house furnishers and booksellers ' , the modern history of the iconic O'Connell Street department store can be traced to the dying months of 1940 , when the lights were going out all over Europe . <p> The wealthy managing director and main shareholder of what was even then a venerable old Dublin department store , Sir Christopher William Nixon of Roebuck House , Milltown , the son of a prominent Dublin doctor , was in serious financial trouble . In 1938 , with war looming and wages rising , he had borrowed the princely sum of ? 200,000 from the Equity Law Assurance Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the loan . <p> In October 1940 , the company went into voluntary liquidation with Eustace Shott of Craig Gardiner &amp; Co appointed as Receiver . <p> It was a situation that appears to mirror what has been going on with the company in the last 10 days . <p> His preferred bidder , the Cork ' merchant prince ' William Dwyer , could n't come up with the money and on November 10 , Shott approached Denis Guiney , who had taken a sleepy drapery in Talbot Street and , in a few years , turned it into a business with a turnover of over ? 1m . <p> When the parties met two days later , Guiney offered ? 222,000 for the lot - the building had already been valued at ? 98,000 . From Brosna in Co Kerry , Guiney had worked in retail all his life and could see the massive potential that could be unlocked in Clerys . <p> His only proviso regarding the deal was that it had to be completed immediately . The Receiver persuaded him to throw another ? 7,500 into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sir Christopher Nixon was outraged at the price and he and the board of the company went to the High Court to try to stop the sale . <p> In a celebrated judgment finding in favour of the Receiver 's decision to sell to Guiney , Mr Justice George Gavan Duffy declared that " Mr Guiney 's methods were unorthodox and direct - he consulted no valuer or brought in no accountants , yet he knew the causes of its ( Clerys ' ) distress and believed he could cure them . This self confidence and the absence of express advice might seem reprehensible to the more cautious operators who follow the beaten track , but he was risking his own money and not the money of his critics . " <p> Clerys reopened on November 29 , 1940 and Guiney was immediately on the road to success , clearing ? 54,000 worth of stock in the first week . According to his biographer , Peter Costello , Denis Guiney " rose from working in small country shops " to running the biggest business in Dublin . He transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new kind of Ireland ... Many talked about the ' New Ireland ' , Denis Guiney helped create it . " <p> His company ' Clery &amp; Co ( 1941 ) Ltd , wholesale &amp; retail drapers ' had a rateable valuation of ? 4,750 by 1947 , making it by far the most valuable building in the country for many years . <p> Guiney was a marketing genius before the term was invented . He refunded the rail fares of customers who spent more than ? 5 , he ran excursion trains from all over Ireland and he targeted his advertising at the big farmers and the new professional classes from outside the capital . <p> He ran tea dances in the department store to entice the middle classes who descended on the new suburbs to the north and south of Dublin after the war . <p> While Arnotts of Henry Street had always been a Dublin store , and mentioned by Sean O'Casey in The Plough and the Stars , Clerys was where the country folk shopped . They were loyal , thrifty and Guiney believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most innovative retailer in the country until the arrival of Ben ' Better Value Beats Them All ' Dunne Snr . <p> When Guiney died in 1967 , he was succeeded by his wife , Mary , who lived in a mansion called Auburn on the Howth Road in Dublin and lived to the age of 103 . Months before she died , she presented a celebrated cartoon by Warner of the various legal eagles involved in her husband 's acquisition of Clerys back in 1940 to a retiring member of the judiciary . <p> But possibly she stayed too long . Clerys , which survived the 1916 Rising and the Receivership of 1940 , was now facing a bigger calamity than both of these tumultuous events - the changing tastes of the Irish people . <p> During Mrs Guiney 's later years , it fell to Arthur Walls , a well-known Dublin accountant whose wife , Pearl , was a niece of the Guineys , to run the store . The shareholders were a diverse group of relatives who mostly acquired their shareholdings through inheritance and were neither directly involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses . <p> Although it turned over ? 70m in 2009 , the directors ' report of that year , signed by Denis Ryan and PJ Timmons , not only graphically told the story of Clerys ' shocking fall from grace , but perfectly captured Ireland on the cusp of financial collapse . <p> " Ireland has suffered a stunning reversal of fortune in the past year as the domestic property crash and the global credit crunch plunged the economy into a severe recession , " it declared . What more needed to be said ? <p> With the shareholders unable to bear the losses , the company was , after more than 70 years in business , sold to the US private equity firm Gordon Brothers , who paid ? 15m and absorbed a ? 26m debt with Bank of Ireland . <p> But they too failed to stem the tide of public apathy towards what had once been Ireland 's most famous department store and , in many ways , a national landmark for country and city folk who met ' under Clerys clock ' ( or UCC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over the Dublin Drapery Warehouse in Sackville Street from Messrs McSweeney &amp; Delaney in 1893 , he did n't immediately change its name . But five years later , when he incorporated the business , he could hardly have foreseen that his name would grace the most impressive storefront in Ireland for well over a century . <p> But it did , even if it had to move out of O'Connell Street for six years after all but the facade of the building was reduced to rubble by the gunboat Helga , which bombarded the street from the River Liffey in 1916 . <p> In various guises the business went on to survive the economic collapse of 1940 , and the catastrophic floods in 2013 that closed it for six months . Last week , in what appears to be the final chapter in Clerys ' long and colourful history , the company once more went into Receivership and overnight was acquired by a company called Natrium , a joint venture between Dublin-based D2 Private and Cheyne Capital Management in the UK , with funding from US-based Quadrant REA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be done with this dinosaur of the golden era of city centre shopping remains to be seen . But Clerys as we know it has gone forever .
