<h> Electric Picnic : The Ticket 's 2015 awards for best in class <h> Where 's the best place to meet your mates ? Has to be the main stage <p> Stradbally 's Electric Picnic is over for another year , how was yours ? From international headline acts to acrobats , it had it all . <p> Fast friends : You ca n't go wrong by the main stage <h> Best sets : <p> Damon Albarn leads Blur through an energetic stormer of a set . R ? is ? n Murphy turns the Electric Arena into a blistering , adventurous , electro-pop powerhouse . War on Drugs show how far excellent playing chops will get you . And as these pages go to press , Florence + the Machine are tearing it up on the Main Stage . The Redneck Manifesto reform for a Salty Dog special . Bitch Falcon go from strength to strength . And Chvrches give us all the tingly feelings . <h> Best wardrobe : <p> R ? is ? n Murphy is a performer of many guises : a timid pensioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paparazzi . A shimmering diva with an apparently inexhaustible supply of sunglasses . A blur of flying black and gold fringe . For her most outr ? number , a scarlet red oval that enveloped her in its fleshy folds , Murphy offers an anatomical interpretation . " I think I look like a . . . " she begins . " Legend , " we all finish . <h> Best sound : <p> Sound mixes at festivals can be hit or miss , but this year most stages sounded impressively crisp throughout the weekend . The awesome set-up in the Despacio tent , though , is a cut above the rest . Vinyl-only sets on a system designed by James Murphy , John Klett , McIntosh Laboratory and Jordan Acoustics , with Murphy and David and Stephen Dewaele taking turns for six-hour shifts . Phenomenal . And it was fun to see how many DJs you could spot in the room at any one time checking out the blingest set-up in the business . <h> Best addition : Despacio <p> See above . <h> Worst addition : E-lites area <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of marketing thought . Who 's got a match ? <h> Most unwelcome development : <p> the proliferation of corporate brands . Let 's not be na ? ve : you 're a consumer here whether you like it or not , shedding tenners every other step . But the palsy infiltration of conglomerates into the social life of a festival , offering lounges and domes , phone-charging and photo ops , snacks and larks in exchange for a promotional tweet and the rights to use your image chilled us to the marrow . <h> Best bargain : water <p> Bottled water for just ? 1 at the Farmers ' Market in Body and Soul . And of course for free from the drinking stations . <h> Biggest rip off : beer <p> Has there been a sudden crisis in the hops market ? Are brew-rich members in OBEC limiting supply ? How else do we interpret the price spike in pints this year ? Leaping from a merely unconscionable high of ? 6 last year to a more brazenly cynical minimum of ? 6.20 ( scaling to ? 6.70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , such beer inflation leaves a sour taste . <p> Wine is now the cheapest option . Wine . We 're told to drink responsibly , but how about charging us the same way ? <h> Best bro brag : <p> OGM from Ho99o9 A gentleman never kisses and tells , chaps ; what-what ? But new crazes in courtship , such as " sexting " , can still be a grey area for social etiquette . Why , only the other night , caddish young swain OGM from modern thrash-hoppers Ho99o9 ( which is pronounced " Ho77o7 " ) , spoke of receiving professionally taken butt shots from a comely young woman of his acquaintance . " Google me , " she deigned to add . " Turns out , " trumpeted OGM 's sparkling repartee , " she 's a porn star . " He seemed ever so pleased . To celebrate his good humour , he also performed a standing backflip . We wish the talented couple good luck and rude health . <h> Best place for the shift : The Gramophone <p> Romance is where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we found quite a lot of it , very frequently , on sweetly uninhibited display by the outsized musical sculpture The Gramophone , near the Pink Moon campsite entrance . Spilling out ragtime jazz through the night , this was a warming spot for wooers , sitting on its steps in tender embrace , against the sensuous lilt of times past , admiring its huge horn . Ah , innocence . <h> Best spuds : Home Fries <p> Atkins be damned -- these crispy hunks of deliciousness , fried in olive oil and smothered in toppings , were the ultimate comfort food for dinner , at the Trailer Park . And lunch . And breakfast . <h> Best piece of art : Away with the Fairies . <p> From the macro to the micro , the creative installation transported us from the Picnic to an even more magical place . Delightful . Best rumour : JM/Hot Chip That former LCD Soundsystem man James Murphy -- here under the Despacio guise -- would join Hot Chip for their Al Doyle-led cover of All My Friends . We 're kind of glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Room for improvement 1 : Security guard knowledge <p> Us : " Where are the nearest toilets ? " Security guard : " They 're in the Oscar Wilde campsite . Turn right and carry on walking . " Forty minutes and a full circle later : " Uhh . . . try left ? " <h> Best newcomer : Jack Garratt <p> His Irish debut set the bar high with a fully-formed sound delivered only by the singer/producer/musician himself -- less of a gimmick than a fascinating watch . <h> Room for improvement 2 : Lighting <p> It 's September -- the grand stretch in the evening is long gone and when it gets dark at Electric Picnic , it really gets dark . Giant illuminated flowers do n't provide as much light as you might think . With 50,000 people milling around in the dark , a floodlight here and there would n't hurt . <h> Most ironic moment : 2Unlimited <h> Heroes of the weekend : Uplift <p> The people from Uplift who arranged a vigil in solidarity with refugees trying to escape into Europe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calais Refugee Community volunteers who collected leftover tents to help those suffering in the crisis . <h> Worst people : The body snatchers <p> On a couple of occasions our journalists encountered seemingly interesting funsters who were , in fact , stealth marketeers seeking full brand penetration in the next fiscal quarter .
