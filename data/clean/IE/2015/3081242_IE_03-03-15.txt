<h> Incontinence in pregnancy ' not normal ' <p> Mar 03 , 2015 <p> Deborah Condon <p> At least one-third of women in Ireland experience urinary incontinence during early pregnancy , while half of women suffer with this problem three months after giving birth , a major new study has found . <p> Incontinence is an uncontrollable and involuntary loss of bladder control . In other words , those affected leak urine when they do not mean to . <p> Researchers at Trinity College Dublin ( TCD ) are carrying out a study - the first of its kind - to track the health of first-time mothers in Ireland . It will follow over 2,600 women throughout their pregnancies and their first year as mothers . This represents almost 10% of all first-time mothers giving birth in this country in any given year . <p> The MAMMI ( Maternal Health And Maternal Morbidity in Ireland ) study will look at a range of health issues including mental health problems , sexual health , diet during and after pregnancy , and caesarean sections . <p> It has just released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women before , during and after birth . These findings are based on the experiences of 860 women . <p> The study found that one in three women occasionally leak urine before becoming pregnant , with one in 12 experiencing this problem at least once a month . <p> During pregnancy , at least one in three women have this problem , with almost one in five leaking urine at least once a month . <p> Meanwhile , one in two women admitted to leaking some urine three months after giving birth , and even six months later , with one in five leaking at least once a month . <p> Before becoming pregnant , those most at risk of urinary incontinence include women with a high body mass index ( BMI ) . In fact , obese and very obese women are four times more likely to experience this problem compared to women of a normal weight . <p> The risk is also increased in those who experience bed wetting as a child . <p> During pregnancy , the risk is increased in those over the age of 35 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who have this problem during pregnancy are three times more likely to still have it three and six months after the birth . <p> According to Dr Deirdre Daly of TCD 's School of Nursing and Midwifery , while leaking urine is common , ' it is not normal and can be treated ' . <p> " Far too many women put up with urinary leakage during and after pregnancy because they think it is ' normal ' or ' to be expected ' . Because of this the majority of the women in the MAMMI study had not really talked to anyone about leaking urine . <p> " The reality is that this can make some women miserable . While it affects them physically , it can also affect them emotionally and socially and affect the way women interact with their partner , " she noted . <p> She pointed out that some women stop exercising or are more cautious about socialising because they are afraid they will leak urine and someone will notice . <p> " Unfortunately , and partly because we have no information on leaking urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who leak urine think they are alone . This can make women feel isolated , embarrassed and reluctant to talk about it or to seek help , " Dr Daly explained . <p> Meanwhile , speaking about the importance of the MAMMI study , its principal investigator , Prof Cecily Begley of TCD , emphasised that currently , there is a lack of information on the health of women after their baby is born . This means that subsequent problems ' remain invisible , not talked about and very often untreated ' . <p> For example , care of the woman focuses on the pregnancy and period straight after the birth . A woman 's final check-up is six weeks after giving birth , ' usually with their GP , when it is assumed that her body has returned to normal ' . <p> " This information is not collected in our maternity services . There is also no connection between the woman 's record held in the maternity hospital and any records kept on her if she has to attend a general hospital with a health problem resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the maternity services never receive feedback on how women who have been in their care for pregnancy and childbirth return to normal health and wellbeing . We hope that this study will bridge that gap and make these issues visible , " Prof Begley commented . <p> The MAMMI study is being funded by the Health Research Board ( HRB ) .
