Major jobs announcement on the horizon  CLARE is expected to get its most significant jobs boost for a number of years within the next 12 weeks .  While there is some uncertainty about the exact number of jobs that are to be created , it 's believed that it will be in excess of 500 , possibly even in the region of 700 .  The company in question is a multinational based in Shannon and it is understood they have won a significant amount of new business and need new workers .  This week , some informed sources said they expect the jobs will be announced within the first quarter of the year . It is understood that there are likely to be a mix of highly skilled and unskilled positions created . The company that is set to create the jobs has been based in Shannon for a number of years . They already employ several hundred staff and have increased headcount in recent times , while management have previously said that Ireland is a very suitable base for their business . during the boom , the increased competitiveness of post-crash Ireland is undoubtedly something that will appeal to them .  As a multinational company , which has bases around the world and which sells its products in many countries , the air links at Shannon are another important factor .  Shannon has long had one of the biggest clusters of multinational investment in Ireland and , while there has been some recovery since the downturn first struck , this would be by some distance the most important jobs announcement there since the Celtic Tiger era .  While the town 's industrial base declined significantly during the recession , there were some positive signs in 2014 , with a number of smaller jobs announcements .  Just last month , long-established Element Six announced they would be taking on another 40 staff at the Shannon plant , with scope for further growth due to a ? 25 million investment and the relocation of ? 20m worth of assets .  Despite some level of economic recovery , the most recent figures showed there were in excess of 8,000 people on than 500 new jobs would obviously be a very significant boost . As well as the obvious benefit to the new workers , their increased spending could provide a welcome shot in the arm for domestic businesses around the Mid-West.
