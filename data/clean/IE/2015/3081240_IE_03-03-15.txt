<h> The Grit Doctor : Reduce the rubbish , bit by biscuit <p> Q Dear Grit Doctor , tell me you are joking that you do n't have a box overflowing with biscuits , bars and crisps at home for the kids . Mine would go on strike if I removed them , and I would run out of ideas and patience . They get awfully grumpy without a biscuit . I have teenagers and they just would n't put up with it . Jen <p> A I really do n't have that sugary gunk at home anymore : I still have the biscuit tin , but it has only healthy treats in it : gingerbread men sweetened with apple juice and packets of raisins for the twins and whatever we may have -- very occasionally -- baked together ( flapjacks , dark chocolate chip cookies , that kind of thing ) . But gone are the Breakaways , custard creams , mini cheddars , crisps and standard chocolate Digestive fare . <p> Do I miss them ? A little , yes , especially right now typing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cup of tea . Does my husband miss them ? Most definitely , but he is a self-confessed crapoholic who needs to keep temptation at bay so is eternally grateful for my treat-tin cull . <p> But , interestingly enough , I think the kids miss them the least . Their expectations lowered so quickly it genuinely surprised me how easy it was to turn them on to the less sugary stuff such as raisins and gingerbread biscuits see note 1 . <p> The key is to delude them into believing it is still a treat -- the treat being given permission to climb up , open the tin and discover something edible within . And not having all that sugary rubbish at home does n't mean we never eat it at all . But it does ensure that we are not eating it every day , or even every week . <p> I accept teenagers are infinitely more complex creatures and far harder to delude . So I suggest you begin your treat-tin cull with this little experiment using their favourite packet of crisps : Cook up one crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be sure to comment on the filthy black smoke coming off it , how foul-smelling it is , and note that it takes ages to burn away , leaving a pool of dark acrid fat on the spoon . Dare one of the little darlings to drink it . They wo n't be tempted , and with luck this little exercise will deter them crisps long enough for you to introduce some healthier alternatives into that tin without the risk of an almighty strop . Plus , you will not be tempted to buy them again . Ever . <p> Back to that tin . Custard cream , anyone ? There is a good reason why biscuits are so cheap , made up as they are in factory vats , chock full of HFCs -- an insanely cheap sugar manufactured from corn but artificially engineered to be even sweeter than the white stuff and trans fats see note 2 . Just a cursory glance at the ingredients list of a bog-standard packet of custard creams will read more like a chemistry lab experiment , so indecipherable is the language from words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are layered up with intoxicating combinations of the dodgiest synthetic sugars and fats , we are rendered incapable of just eating the one and moving on . Bear in mind that we get more than enough sugar from pasta , milk , bread , cereals , fruit and vegetables to take us to the World Health Organisation maximum daily limit way before we add in cakes , muffins , puddings , pies , cookies , yogurts , drinks and so on see note 3 . Just one solitary fruit juice has us teetering on the daily maximum amount before we 've even sat down to eat breakfast . So you see now where that tin is taking your family : way , way beyond sugar saturation point . <h> Stiffen your resolve <p> Do n't bother telling your teenage kids about all this : they wo n't listen to a word of it , I am writing it so that you have it ringing in your ears on your next supermarket shop , to help you steer clear of the crap aisle and to stiffen your resolve in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty the tin in a panic . Notwithstanding the urgency of the situation , I recommend a slow weaning process for the whole family . Swap one type of crappy treat for another healthy one and/or phase them out gradually so it does n't become a huge bone of contention for you all to choke on . So , for example , once you 've fired those crisps from the tin , in their place you might have homemade popcorn , or bake slivers of their favourite vegetables : courgette , butternut squash , or carrots to create vegetable crisps . And eat them with a homemade veggie dip . Or , for grit fiends , ricecakes . <p> Ultimately , you have to be gritty about it and stick to your guns . Remind yourself that you , and not your teenagers , are in charge . If you are footing the bill for all this crap and choose no longer to do so , they will just have to suck it up . You are not under any obligation to feed their sugar/junk/processed food addiction and are doing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap . <p> The Grit Doctors says : An oatcake tastes plenty sweet enough when there are no digestives on offer . Note 1 . Note " less sugary " rather than " sugar-free " : a misnomer of the highest order when you consider that all carbohydrate breaks down into sugar . To have a sugar-free diet would be to eat only fat and meat . Which is utterly daft . <p> Note 2 : HFCs are widely agreed to be the worst type of sugar , manufactured in factory vats , designed to give food a longer shelf life while effortlessly raising the risk of heart disease in consumers. * <p> Note 3 : The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommends no more than 10 teaspoons of sugar a day for an adult . More recent draft guidelines from WHO suggest that a reduction to below 5 per cent of total energy intake per day would have additional benefits . Five per cent of total energy intake is equivalent to about 25g , or six teaspoons of sugar per day for an adult of normal body mass index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freshly squeezed orange juice can contain eight teaspoons . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community , including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards .
