ask audrey has been sorting out cork people for years  friday , september 25 , 2015  got an issue ? ask audrey ...  guten tag . i am in cork for three months and see that everyone is watching the rugby world cup . can you explain the rules ? -- karl , berlin  here is my understanding of how it works . the fat guys all run into each other , while the slightly slimmer guys stand in a line watching them . eventually the fat guys get tired and have a lie down on top of each other . the ball comes out the back of this lie down and the skinnier guys kick it back and forward to each other for half an hour . then the fat guys wake up and start running into each other again . every now and again the referee stops play because someone dropped the ball . that 's the only thing you are not allowed to do in rugby . everything else would appear to be okay . sometimes one group of fat is some manly hugging , but no shifting like in soccer . after 80 minutes they add up the score and new zealand wins .  hey . my girlfriends and i are flying in to cork from london for a hen party this weekend . ( we thought it would be fun to slum it for a few days . ) what can you tell us about men in cork ? -- tashki , chelsea ( the posh bit , none of your made in chelsea vulgarity here . )  i could tell you all sorts of things about men in cork . i wo n't write them here because i know my husband reads this column . ( do n't forget to put out the bins , love . ) you 'll find men from all over the world in cork . quite a few of them have hardly any english at all and tend to communicate with whistles and hand signals . they are known locally as kerrymen . one thing for certain is you 'll get a welcome here on leeside . it 's a well-established get their hands on posh totty . even if it means listening to a whining blow-hole like yourself .  i 'm planning to buy what we 'll call a sex toy online . i do n't want it delivered to the door because our postman is a bit too familiar as it is . would you recommend i use one of those outdoor parcel pick-up services advertised on the radio ? -- laura , sundays well  i would not . picking a parcel up at one of those yokes is a complete no-no . you might as well wear a t-shirt saying ' i 'm up to all sorts behind closed doors . ' it 's given me a new pastime . i park near to one of the parcel pick-ups and wait for a client to arrive . you should see the look of terror when i shout " go on you dirty perv " out the window at them . i 'm not the only one taking part in this new thing called perv-shouting . it can be hard to get a parking near the one in a few hours .  hola . i am travelling to cork next week to start studying in ucc . is it possible to be friends with an irish boy without him wanting to sleep with me ? -- maria , barcelona  not really . particularly if you look like penelope cruz and he 's after a few cans of der student special from lidl . ( i hear that after five cans , almost everyone looks like penelope cruz . ) there is one exception . that 's if you are one of those spanish women who has gone small and stooped prematurely , rather than waiting until she is 50 . in that case , you 'll have no end of irish lads looking to be your best friend . that 's because you fit into every irish man 's dream category -- someone i wo n't try and shift after five pints who happens to have a hot friend from valencia . i 'm not sure if you fit into this category . send in a photo and i 'll let you know .  top of are visitin ' the auld sod next week . we 'll be spendin ' a few days in your fair city and i was wondering what is the best way to get someone 's attention in cork ? -- hank magillamurphy iii , chicago  you could always try stand on oliver plunkett street and shout " this place is n't a patch on dublin or galway . " that 's an excellent way to get attention in cork . medical attention , so make sure your insurance will cover it before you travel . the correct way to get attention in cork is with the phrase ' c'mere ' . this can be lengthened to come here to me if you are talking to someone with delusions of grandeur from bishopstown . ( as if there 's any other kind of person in bishopstown . ) the exception is when you are in a restaurant , when c'mere  is replaced by sorry ! do n't get this wrong . german visitor said ' excuse me ' to a waitress in a restaurant on mccurtain street back in 1987 . rugby works ... sometimes one group of fat guys pushes the other group over the line and there is some manly hugging , but no shifting like in soccer
