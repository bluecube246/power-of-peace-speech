" i feel compelled to check my mail ... i am having the time of my life . "  even mark 's children feared their dad might have played a part in their mum 's death -- they 'd seen his obsessive behaviour towards her . anne had died just as she was about to break free , which said anne had choked on food -- probably a piece of chicken because some was found in her stomach . her death was deemed accidental .  straight away , relations between mark and his children grew strained . mark wanted anne buried while her children wanted her cremated -- which had been anne 's wish . mark changed his mind when police brought him in for more questioning and anne was cremated . it seemed the case was closed .  the years went by and mark remarried . his children filed a wrongful death lawsuit against their dad , alleging that he drugged , beat and choked anne , then stood by as she died . it was dismissed , but mark agreed on a settlement without admitting any guilt .  google maps  the courthouse where mark was finally found guilty of murder  again , mark walked free . it took 12 years before the case was reopened and a new autopsy was ordered -- done through a re-examination of the paperwork , pictures and evidence .  this time , a medical examiner said anne significant bruising to her arms , pelvic area , head , face and chest , as well as lacerations on her face .  in 2013 , mark was charged with murder . at the trial this year at montgomery county courthouse , mark , now 70 , confirmed that he knew anne was planning to leave him and that she was sleeping in the spare room . his daughters testified against him .  after anne 's death , mark had written lists and letters . one read , " ... after the toxicology report , they will have all they need . they will come to get me . " another was a letter mark had written to god the day anne died . it read , " ... please put us back together now or you know something bad will happen very soon .

" did mrs faville indicate that she was in love with you ? " he was asked . " yes , and that she always had been , " he replied .  both medical examiners argued their opinions on the autopsy , but after a few hours of deliberation , the jury had a verdict . mark was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and anne 's family sobbed with relief .  but there was a final twist . as mark was led away , court officials were heard yelling , " drop it , drop it . " suddenly , the courtroom was evacuated .  after a few hours , it was revealed that mark faville had died from a self-inflicted wound .  it was never disclosed just how mark killed himself -- to protect court security and so others could n't follow his example . courtroom staff are n't allowed to carry guns , and x-ray machines screen for metal objects . all that was revealed was that he 'd died from a laceration from a @ @ @ @ @
