Tuanzebe is considered to be one of the most promising prospects in United 's academy , but manager Van Gaal still felt the need to explain his decision in his programme notes for the West Brom game , report the Manchester Evening News .  " Over the coming months , using the full squad will become important in our quest to be challenging on three fronts , " Van Gaal wrote .  " Axel Tuanzebe was included in the matchday squad for our trip to Crystal Palace , and this is important in the development of the youth players .  " Axel stayed on the bench but the experience of travelling with the team , training and being part of the team meetings is an important part of the learning curve that he and other young players will take as they progress . "  Injuries to defenders Antonio Valencia , Paddy McNair and Luke Shaw , as well as right-back Matteo Darmian 's suspension , suggested Tuanzebe would be on the bench against West Brom .  Instead , Van Gaal has called of playing at centre half .
