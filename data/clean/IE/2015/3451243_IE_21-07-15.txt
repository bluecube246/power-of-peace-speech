japanese-style multi-storey bicycle parking planned for dublin  japanese-style multi-storey bicycle parking will come into effect in dublin within the next four years , a senior dublin city council engineer has said .  dublin city council is formulating plans for secure multi-storey bicycle parking which will both tackle bicycle crime and increase the number of spaces for bicycle parking .  underground bicycle parking in japan . photo : getty  underground bicycle parking in japan . photo : getty  underground bicycle parking in japan . photo : getty  multi-storey bicycle parking in japan .  michael phillips , dublin city council 's director of traffic and city engineer said : " one of the issues with theft is we 're afraid we 'll lose the cyclists if it continues . "  " in japan , there are dedicated multi-storey parks where you get a ticket and a machine takes the bike and parks it . "  " we would minimise the price of it . but if you want to secure your bicycle , then i 'm sure you would n't .  " it 'll be three or four years yet before the japanese style parking happens . in the meantime , we 'll be trying to use existing car parks and use those spaces in the city . that will come on stream sooner . we 'll have negotiations with car park owners about it . "  " the price of land is at a premium but we 're trying to see can we use multi-storey car parks a bit better to actually provide safe places for bicycle parking because bike theft is a huge issue . "  over the last 10 years , bike theft has increased by 227 per cent . around 6,750 bicycles were reported stolen last year .  for the first time in dublin city , a coordinated multi-agency think tank is working to tackle bike theft .  dublin cycling campaign , gardai , dublin city council , the national transport authority , and trade websites , are exchanging ideas on how to reduce bicycle crime .  david timoney from dublin cycling campaign said : " you need a multi-agency group angles to it . "  " first of all , a small change would make a difference , if we could record the details of every bicycle frame number , that would make a big difference - if we could encourage bike shops and websites to register the details of owners . "  " also , over half the bikes stolen are from cyclists who are using chain locks and poor cable locks . ' soldsecure ' is a lock standard system set up by police in the uk -- and they recommend that everyone should have a gold standard lock . "  " if people stopped using cable locks it would make a huge difference . "  the dublin cycling campaign estimates that at least 20,000 bikes were stolen last year , and it is currently conducting a survey to try and uncover the correct figure .  " one of the problems is we do n't actually know how many bikes are stolen in dublin each year . we estimate that it 's a multiple of the official figure but we just do n't know figure , " mr timoney said .  he added : " dublin is full for cars now , we ca n't have more cars in the city if we 're to avoid gridlock , and planners understand that dublin is full for cars so a few initiatives need to be brought in . "  " there 's a big problem with underground parking in apartment buildings for bicycles . there are ' wheel racks ' where you ca n't lock your bicycle frame to the rack , so the thieves just undo the wheel and walk out with the bike . "  last month , gardai announced that they are using ' bait bikes ' fitted with gps tracker devices in dublin city centre to target bicycle thieves . the tracker devices will hopefully mean that the bike can be found and the thief identified and arrested .  in dun laoghaire , gardai took inspiration from london 's met police and fixed " information bikes " ( renovated old bicycles which display information on how to safely lock your bike ) to public bicycle racks .  a reduction of 25pc in bike theft in dun laoghaire rathdown as a result of the info bike , " said sergeant kelvin courtney from garda community relations .  " the idea behind it is that you 're demotivating the offender . "  only 10pc of bike owners are able to provide an garda s ? och ? na with the bicycle frame number , he said .  " we 're trying to get people to record their bicycle serial numbers as much as possible . we have hundreds of bicycles that we ca n't give back to the owner because they do n't have the serial number recorded , " sergeant kelvin said .  " if we can get the number of people filling in the bike ( bicycle information key essentials ) , and leave it in their wallet or email it to themselves , or take a photo of it on their phone , that would help . "  the facts :  in 2014  34pc of all thefts were reported in dublin city centre ,  40pc in the rest of dublin metropolitan region .  twice as many bikes are stolen during the summer months , peaking in july , august and september .  two thirds of bikes are stolen from public places  the most likely time is weekday afternoons  one third are stolen from residential locations , houses , sheds , gardens etc ...  the most likely time is overnight  recommended steps to take to educe the impact of bike theft , as given by garda ? .
