<p> He appeared to rule out the prospect of opening churches for accommodation , but said priests across Sligo and Roscommon had been contacted with a view to compiling an inventory of the suitable accommodation available for refugees . <p> " I 'm sending out a message to the priests with an information form which I 'm inviting them to make available to parishioners , which would seek to begin to identify places that may be available- be it a vacant house or a granny flat , " he told RT ? radio . <p> Properties on the list will then be assessed to ensure they are of an adequate standard , and church officials in Elphin will also liaise with State agencies and local authorities to identify suitable spaces . <p> " If you have two families it 's not beyond the bounds of possibility that with local support from other families who might not necessarily be providing the accommodation and local businesses , that very decent provision could be made for them , " he said . <p> " The one thing I would be conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' why not open the churches ? ' , and of course in an immediate emergency you would do something like that but the reality is there are n't showers and toilets and bedrooms and privacy in church buildings , " said the bishop . <p> " What you 're looking to do is welcome people in a manner that is consistent with their own dignity . Ireland has long since recognised that direct provision is not the way forward , we should be looking to try and create a situation where a family unit can stay together . " <p> Gesture of solidarity <p> Speaking yesterday , the pope called on " every religious community " to take in one migrant family in a gesture of solidarity , and said the Vatican itself would be welcoming two . <p> There are a total of 1,360 Catholic parishes across the Ireland . Church authorities have not yet announced a unified plan of action in response to the pope 's suggestion . <p> Bishop Doran says he has already received representations from people willing to help out with accommodation , and thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best practice regarding the country 's current domestic homelessness . <p> " Accommodation is there , in many cases it 's underutilised , especially in the west of Ireland , and I think there 's a genuine warmth in people 's hearts towards people in need . <p> " I think maybe if we do this and if we do it well , we may realise that we actually have the solution to our own homelessness crisis as well , " he said . <p> Addressing the issue over the weekend , T ? naiste Joan Burton said there need be " no upper limit " on the amount of people Ireland brings in following suggestions that the minimum threshold will be set at 1,800 . <p> Responding to queries from The Irish Times , a spokesman for the Irish Bishops ' Conference said the issue of housing migrants can be dealt with individually by each of Ireland 's 26 dioceses , adding that the refugee crisis will be a " major " item of discussion at the autumn meeting of the Irish Catholic Bishops ' Conference .
