adele : one of the scariest things about 25 is looking into the future  adele was scared of " looking into the future " with her new album ' 25 ' .  the ' hello ' hitmaker - who released her third studio lp on friday ( 21.11.15 ) - says she has been focusing " massively " on how to move forward with her career , something she did n't think she 'd have to do for at least another decade .  she said : " my whole life , even this comeback - because that 's what it is - is built around my kid . one of the scariest things about my new album is that , for the first time in my life , i 'm looking into the future , into the next 20 years . before it was all about what you 'd do on friday , plans for the weekend .  " i 'm moving forward in a massive way , in a way i did n't think i 'd be doing for another ten years my past , and deciding what to take with me . "  and another scary prospect for the singer is the idea of getting " lonely " after performing on stage .  she told usatoday.com : " there 's something quite lonely about the idea of performing for people and then going home on your own . "  however , the 27-year-old star has vowed to perform a string of shows , especially in america where she had to cut her 2012 tour short due to a vocal hemorrhage .  she previously said : " i will do as many us shows at least as i did last time , which was n't that many , so do n't get too excited .
