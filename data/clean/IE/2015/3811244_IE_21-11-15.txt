Adele : One of the scariest things about 25 is looking into the future  Adele was scared of " looking into the future " with her new album ' 25 ' .  The ' Hello ' hitmaker - who released her third studio LP on Friday ( 21.11.15 ) - says she has been focusing " massively " on how to move forward with her career , something she did n't think she 'd have to do for at least another decade .  She said : " My whole life , even this comeback - because that 's what it is - is built around my kid . One of the scariest things about my new album is that , for the first time in my life , I 'm looking into the future , into the next 20 years . Before it was all about what you 'd do on Friday , plans for the weekend .  " I 'm moving forward in a massive way , in a way I did n't think I 'd be doing for another ten years my past , and deciding what to take with me . "  And another scary prospect for the singer is the idea of getting " lonely " after performing on stage .  She told USAToday.com : " There 's something quite lonely about the idea of performing for people and then going home on your own . "  However , the 27-year-old star has vowed to perform a string of shows , especially in America where she had to cut her 2012 tour short due to a vocal hemorrhage .  She previously said : " I will do as many US shows at least as I did last time , which was n't that many , so do n't get too excited . "
