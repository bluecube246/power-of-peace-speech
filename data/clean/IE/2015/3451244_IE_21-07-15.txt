<h> A pensioner 's sight has been restored after he received an amazing ' bionic eye ' <p> Tuesday , July 21 , 2015 <p> A Manchester United fan has got his sight back for the first time in 10 years after receiving a state-of-the-art " bionic eye " and ca n't wait for the new Premier League season . <p> Ray Flynn , 80 , from Audenshaw , Manchester , has AMD -- advanced dry age related macular degeneration -- and is the first patient with AMD in the world to undergo such a procedure . <p> The retired engineer is also believed to be the first human being to benefit from natural and artificial sight at the same time . <p> Losing his sight affected the quality of his life as it deteriorated -- as a keen cook he was forced to read recipes with a magnifying glass but now he can cast the instrument aside . <p> ( Peter Byrne/PA ) <p> He said : " Before when I was looking at a plant in the garden it was like a honeycomb in the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can now walk round the garden and see things . <p> " It 's definitely improved my vision but I have n't been out and about on a bus yet . I do n't think I will for a little while . " <p> AMD is the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world with between 20 and 25 million sufferers worldwide . <p> The pensioner received an Argus II retinal implant at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last month . More than 130 patients have received a bionic eye but Ray is the first person with peripheral vision to receive one . <p> ( Peter Byrne/PA ) <h> How does it work ? <p> Developed by Second Sight Medical Products , it works by converting video images captured by a miniature camera housed in the patient 's glasses into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to electrodes on the surface of the retina . <p> These pulses stimulate the retina 's remaining cells resulting in the corresponding perception of patterns of light in the brain . <p> The patient then learns to interpret these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hey ? <h> What is Ray looking forward to ? <p> ( Peter Byrne/PA ) <p> Ray is looking forward to watching the new Premier League season with his brother Pete , 77 . <p> Pete said : " We do n't miss a game on the television but he ca n't make out the players on the pitch and he can only watch if he sits in a certain position and looks from the corner of his eye . <p> " It gets very tiring for him so watching the first game of the season should be a new experience . <p> " He is also into his cooking and is a fan of Delia Smith . He does a lot of it by instinct but using a magnifying glass to follow a recipe takes him a long time and he tries very hard with that . " <h> What do the bionic eye scientists have to say ? <p> ( Peter Byrne/PA ) <p> Professor Paulo Stanga , consultant ophthalmologist and vitreoretinal surgeon at the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital , said : " Mr Flynn 's progress is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects very effectively . <p> " Ray had to do everything with his peripheral vision , it 's very tiring , it is exhausting , What we are hoping to achieve is to improve Ray 's central vision so he does not have to work so hard with his peripheral vision . <p> " This is new information that Ray 's brain is receiving and his brain now needs to get use to interpreting it . <p> " He has not given up on losing his central vision . He is a motivated patient and that is crucial . " <p> He added : " As far as I am concerned , the first results of the trial are a total success and I look forward to treating more dry AMD patients with the Argus II as part of this trial . We are currently recruiting four more patients to the trial in Manchester . <p> " On behalf of the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital , we feel privileged to be conducting the world 's first study into retinal implants for patients with AMD . This technology is revolutionary and changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to live more independently . "
