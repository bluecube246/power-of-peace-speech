novak djokovic lost a point in bizarre fashion at the french open on thursday following a lapse in concentration .  the world number one was closing in on a straight sets victory over gilles muller and on the brink of a 5-1 lead in the third set when he flicked his racket and stopped one of muller 's shots from going long .  there was no doubt that the point , and the game , would have been djokovic 's but technically the point was still live and so it went to his opponent .  the unlikely reprieve allowed muller to force the issue for a while longer but in the end , the result was the same with djokovic sealing a 6-1 , 6-4 , 6-4 win to progress .  thejournal.ie is a full participating member of the press council of ireland and supports the office of the press ombudsman . this scheme in addition to defending the freedom of the press , offers readers a quick , fair and free method of dealing with complaints that they may have in relation the office of the press ombudsman lo-call 1890 208 080 or go to www.pressombudsman.ie or www.presscouncil.ie  please note that thejournal.ie uses cookies to improve your experience and to provide services and advertising . for more information on cookies please refer to our cookies policy .  journal media does not control and is not responsible for user created content , posts , comments , submissions or preferences . users are reminded that they are fully responsible for their own created content and their own posts , comments and submissions and fully and effectively warrant and indemnify journal media in relation to such content and their ability to make such content , posts , comments and submissions available . journal media does not control and is not responsible for the content of external websites.
