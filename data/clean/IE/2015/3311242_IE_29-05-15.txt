Novak Djokovic lost a point in bizarre fashion at the French Open on Thursday following a lapse in concentration .  The world number one was closing in on a straight sets victory over Gilles Muller and on the brink of a 5-1 lead in the third set when he flicked his racket and stopped one of Muller 's shots from going long .  There was no doubt that the point , and the game , would have been Djokovic 's but technically the point was still live and so it went to his opponent .  The unlikely reprieve allowed Muller to force the issue for a while longer but in the end , the result was the same with Djokovic sealing a 6-1 , 6-4 , 6-4 win to progress .
