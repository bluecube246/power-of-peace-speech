munster to play top 14 champions stade fran ? ais while ulster get saracens and toulose  leinster 's worst nightmare was realised in neuchatel this afternoon after they were assigned to pool five where they will face three-time and defending champions , toulon , previous title holders bath , whom they beat in last season 's quarter-final and two-time european winners , wasps , whom they faced twice at the pool stage last season , in next season 's champions cup .  munster find themselves alongside french champions stade francais , perennial foes , leicester tigers and italian side benetton treviso in pool three while ulster must clamber past aviva premiership winners , saracens , toulouse and another french club in tournament debutants , oyonnax .  in the european challenge cup connacht will face french club , brive , english side , the newcastle falcons and a trip to siberia where they will take on enisei-stm .  second captains  leinster though have been handed the most difficult task of the three irish provinces in the champions cup . while munster and ulster the fourth tier in the draw , treviso and newcomers oyonnax , leinster watched as wasps , a side that they narrowly beat ( rds ) and drew with ( ricoh arena ) , were placed in pool five .  it also means a quick return for jimmy gopperth to the rds , albeit in wasps colours this time .  as a major aside it also means that while munster avoided a quick return for paul o'connell , leinster will have to get to grips with the ireland captain , when he arrives in the toulon colours . bath under mike ford have been a joy to watch and one suspects will only get better again , having taken on board the experience of losing the premiership final .  toulon who have won the last three european cups beat leinster in last year 's semi-final in marseille . given the quality of the teams it would seem nigh on impossible to see two teams emerging from pool five , making it look like a winner-take-all scenario .  munster will be reasonably happy despite catching the french champions tends to outshine marquee names like sergio parisse and morne steyn .  the tigers will have a new coach aaron mauger in situ next season and while they were unlucky with injuries in the campaign just gone , they are not the force in english or european rugby of bygone days . treviso can be a sticky prospect at home but they too have slipped standard wise and will be viewed as a potential 10-pointer for the rest of the teams .  when ulster players have nightmares it 's probably saracens that dominate them , having beaten the irish province in successive quarterfinals in 2013 and 2014 , the latter on foot of a controversial sending off for jared payne . mark mccall takes the english champions back into europe hoping to go one better than last year 's semifinal .  toulouse will be under a new coaching baton as guy noves moves to take over france following the upcoming world cup while newcomers oyonnax are set for an interesting debut season .  leinster club captain jamie heaslip said that like most of the players he was as much as you look forward to the off-season , it is n't long before you start looking towards critical dates and i suppose from a leinster point of view that first date was today and the draw for the champions cup , " said the irish number eight .  " in many ways it is hard to even visualise the champions cup and the pool games as november is so far away . i very much stay in the moment and focus on the next game or the next challenge and i suppose there is so much rugby to be played between now and then . but we are due back for pre-season two weeks today and the thoughts of toulon , bath and wasps will focus the minds on the work ahead for all of the lads and the schedule that leo ( cullen ) and dan ( tobin ) have set out for us .  " obviously there will be the hype around paulie and his return to these shores to take on an irish team but leaving paul ( o'connell ) aside , toulon are .  " to come up against another two of last seasons ' opponents is unique i suppose but in the same way as with castres last season , you have to take each game on its merits . bath finished out the year very well and on another day could have been in tier 1 as premiership winners , while wasps were the leading try scorers in the premiership . we 'll also be coming up against jimmy ( gopperth ) and brendan ( macken ) so that 's another tie where there will be plenty of interest .  " last season was a huge stepping stone for this group of players reaching the semi-final and pushing toulon as close as we did . but that is no consolation . you ultimately want to reach the biggest stage and hopefully after reaching a quarter and a semi the last two years we can go one better . "  heaslip feels the squad will be re-energised by the return of former players johnny sexton and isa nacewa .  " the nucleus of this team is very young , , jordi murphy and jack mcgrath were all competing in european semis for the first time . that is brilliant experience for those lads . we have also lost some big characters but with johnny ( sexton ) and isa ( nacewa ) coming back , and other lads coming in , and the experience we have gained over the last few seasons , we 'd be hopeful of giving a good account of ourselves again next season .
