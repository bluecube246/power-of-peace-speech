<h> Jail sentence for hoax bomb threat <p> 14:22Saturday 31 October 2015 <p> A 66 year-old Derry man has received a five-month jail sentence for making a hoax bomb threat in July of this year . <p> James Harkin appeared at Derry Magistrate 's Court via video link from Maghaberry Prison yesterday morning . The court heard that Harkin , who has an address at Altcar Park , telephoned the fire and rescue service on July 30 from a pay box beside Damien House , Foyle Road . CCTV footage later recovered by police placed Harkin at the scene at the time the call was made . <p> A solicitor for the Public Prosecution Service told the court that Harkin had claimed he was from Oglaigh n na hEireann and had used a code word when he alleged that explosives had been abandoned near the Railway Museum on Foyle Road . Harkin had initially denied making the call and said he had called BT on 151 to ask that a new phone line be installed in his friend 's home . <p> The court then heard that Harkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bishop Street when he alleged that a firearm had been left at an address in Shipquay Street . <p> Defence barrister Eoghan Devlin told the court the code word which had been used by his client had actually been " bastard " and as such the authorities would have realised that they were not dealing with a serious threat from a terrorist organisation . <p> " Mr Harkin is on anti-psychotic mediation and he mixed this medication with alcohol , " said Mr Devlin . " I think that the court is able to see that he cuts a rather pathetic figure . He is more a man to be pitied that to be scorned . " <p> But District Judge Barney McElholm said that even if police had been minded to be " cynical " about the threat , they still had to close the area down ; " My own home town has been closed down in this way , several times in recent weeks . Although I think that more sinister elements that this one are responsible for that , " he said . <p> This website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .
