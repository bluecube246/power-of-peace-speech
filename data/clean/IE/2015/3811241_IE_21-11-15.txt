Exhibition  Capa in Color  Recently presented at the International Center of Photography and now available for travel , " Capa in Color " presents Robert Capa 's color photographs to the European public for the first time . Although he is recognized almost exclusively as a master of black-and-white photography , Capa began working regularly with color film in 1941 and used it until his death in 1954 . While some of this work was published in the magazines of the day , the majority of these images have never been printed or seen in any form .  " Capa in Color " includes over 150 contemporary color prints by Capa , as well as personal papers and tearsheets from the magazines in which the images originally appeared . Organized by Cynthia Young , curator of Capa Collections at ICP , the exhibition presents an unexpected aspect of Capa 's career that has been previously edited out of posthumous books and exhibitions , and show how he embraced color photography and integrated it into his work as a photojournalist in the 1940s and 1950s reputation as one of history 's most notable photojournalists is well established . Born Endre Ern ? Friedmann in Budapest and naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1946 , he was deemed " The Greatest War Photographer in the World " by Picture Post in a late 1938 publication of his Spanish Civil War photographs . During World War II , he worked for such magazines as Collier 's and Life , extensively portraying preparation for war as well as its devastating aftermath . His best-known images symbolized for many the brutality and valor of war and changed the public perception of , and set new standards for , war photography .  July 27 , 1938 , while in China for eight months covering the Sino-Japanese war , Robert Capa wrote to a friend at his New York agency , " ... send 12 rolls of Kodachrome with all instructions ; ... Send it " Via Clipper " because I have an idea for Life " . Although no color film from China survives except for four prints published in the October 17 , 1938 , issue of Life , before it was widely used by many other photojournalists .  In 1941 , he photographed Ernest Hemingway at his home in Sun Valley , Idaho , in color , and used color for a story about crossing the Atlantic on a freighter with an Allied convoy , published in the Saturday Evening Post . While Capa is best known for the black-and-white images of D-Day , he also used color film sporadically during World War II , most notably to photograph American troops and the French Camel Corps in Tunisia in 1943 .  Capa 's use of color film exploded in his postwar stories for magazines such as Holiday ( USA ) , Ladies ' Home Journal ( USA ) , Illustrated ( UK ) , and Epoca ( Italy ) . These photographs , which until now have been seen only in magazine spreads , brought the lives of ordinary and exotic people from around the world to American and European readers alike , and were markedly different from the war reportage that had dominated Capa 's early career . Capa 's technical ability coupled with his engagement to move back and forth between black and white and color film and integrate color to complement the subjects he photographed . These early stories include photographs of Moscow 's Red Square from a 1947 trip to the USS R with writer John Steinbeck and refugees and the lives of new settlers in Israel in 1949 -- 50 . For the Generation X project , Capa traveled to Oslo and northern Norway , Essen , and Paris to capture the lives and dreams of youth born before the war .  Capa 's photographs also provided readers a glimpse into more glamorous lifestyles that depended on the allure and seduction of color photography . In 1950 , he covered fashionable ski resorts in the Swiss , Austrian , and French Alps , and the stylish French resorts of Biarritz and Deauville for the burgeoning travel market capitalized on by Holiday magazine . He even tried fashion photography by the banks of the Seine and on the Place Vend ? me . Capa also photographed actors and directors on European film sets , including Ingrid Bergman in Roberto Rossellini 's Viaggio in Huston 's Moulin Rouge . Additional portraiture in this period included striking images of Picasso , on the beach near Vallauris , France with his young son Claude .  Capa carried at least two cameras for all of his postwar stories : one with black-and-white film and one with color , using a combination of 35mm and 4 ? 5 Kodachrome and medium-format Ektachrome film , emphasizing the importance of this new medium in his development as a photographer . He continued to work with color until the end of his life , including in Indochina , where he was killed in May 1954 . His color photographs of Indochina presage the color images that dominated the coverage from Vietnam in the 1960s .  " Capa in Color " is the first museum exhibition to explore Capa 's fourteen-year engagement with color photography and to assess this work in relation to his career and period in which he worked . His talent with black-andwhite composition was prodigious , and using color film halfway through his career required a new discipline . " Capa in Color " explores how he work adapted to a new postwar sensibility . The new medium required him to readjust to color compositions , but also to a postwar audience , interested in being entertained and transported to new places .
