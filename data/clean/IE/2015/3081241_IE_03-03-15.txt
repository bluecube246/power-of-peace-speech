HandR Block is the latest player to get into the business . <p> In January , it launched " Tax Identity Shield , " which , for $29.95 a year , does an annual , pretax season scan for your name on websites suspected of selling personal information , sends an e- mail if your information is on another tax return filed through HandR Block , and gives basic help navigating red tape . <p> TransUnion also unveiled a new product in January , a mobile app that , among other things , lets users paying $17.95 a month freeze and unfreeze their credit report with a swipe of their finger . <p> Existing products are going strong : The largest niche player , Lifelock , saw 40 per cent of all new members in 2014 join in the year 's final quarter.While details of all the protection products vary greatly , most charge from $10 to $30 a month . <p> For that , services include credit monitoring , fraud resolution , and increasingly , insurance for out-of-pocket costs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for plans to offer up to $1 million in coverage . And it 's that insurance angle that comes in for the most criticism by consumer experts . <p> For one thing , the coverage typically kicks in only for losses not covered by one 's financial institution or by other policies , such as homeowner 's insurance . " It 's a hollow promise , " says Gary Frank , chief executive of LCG , a national provider of employer-sponsored legal benefits . " They 're claiming to provide coverage for things that are already being provided by the consumer financial institutions . " <p> Identity fraud statistics just out from Javelin Research and Strategy put the need for insurance in perspective . There are two primary categories of fraud : existing account fraud , such as when someone gets access to your credit card , and new account fraud , which uses your information to open new accounts . <p> Existing account fraud is by far the most prevalent , accounting for $14 billion of the $16 billion in total fraud losses last year , according to Javelin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was just $63 , and many victims will pay nothing . " That 's not to say there are n't going to be people who suffer significant losses , " says Al Pascual , director of fraud and security at Javelin . " But even for those outliers , that kind of coverage is merely a peace-of-mind product . Most people are not going to need $1 million in coverage . " <p> For most consumers , a bigger concern is the hassle and time it takes to resolve issues arising from ID theft . New account fraud , though far less common , can be much more costly and time consuming . The mean consumer cost in 2014 was $398 , and the mean resolution time was 25 hours . <p> Here 's where companies that offer insurance as part of a plan say there 's value . Experian 's ProtectMyID plan , for example , provides up to $1,500 a week , for a maximum of five weeks , for lost wages during time spent rectifying records after ID theft . <p> It will also cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovering one 's identity , as well as documentation , travel , and other expenses . There are also provisions for legal and private investigation costs . <p> Lifelock says it has negotiated with insurance companies " to cover payments for lost wages , bail bonds and other ancillary fees related to cases , " among other things . Consumers willing and able to do the legwork themselves have access to free or inexpensive resources for monitoring and resolving credit fraud . But no single product or measure acts as a deadbolt lock against thieves , says Paul Stephens , director of policy and advocacy at the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse . <p> Credit monitoring tells you only if new accounts are being opened in your name , so it wo n't help you if thieves have your credit and debit card numbers and go on a shopping spree . In that case , the best defence is being vigilant about checking your accounts . <p> Though less common , the hijacking of your social security number can be much more damaging , since thieves can use it to open new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID fraud . <p> Some protection plans monitor your social security number and alert you if someone applies for credit in your name . Most simply monitor your credit report , though , which means it can be more than a month before you are alerted about a new account , says Pascual . <p> As an alternative , LCG 's Frank recommends placing credit alerts with Equifax , Experian , and TransUnion . It 's free , lasts 90 days , and requires creditors to take extra precautions before issuing new credit under your name .
