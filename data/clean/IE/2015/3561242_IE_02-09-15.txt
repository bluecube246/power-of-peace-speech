The 29-year-old attacking midfielder scored 45 goals in 326 appearances for Atletico , playing a massive part in their recent Europa League and Copa del Rey triumphs as well as their famous 2013/14 La Liga title . However , feeling that he needed a move away for the sake of his career , he joined Atheltic Bilbao at the close of the Spanish transfer window .  Fittingly , his send off from Atleti was truly lovely . He was publicly lauded for his contribution and told of the club 's love and affection for him - all before he broke down in tears with the emotion of it all .  Though he managed to stop weeping long enough to thank his new team for the opportunity to join them , his goodbye to the club where he 's spent the best years of his footballing life was genuinely heartwarming .  After watching this farewell , you 'll fall in love with football once more . We need to go and cry now . Goodbye , Raul.
