belgian prime minister charles michel said the decision to raise the threat alert to the highest level was taken " based on quite precise information about the risk of an attack like the one that happened in paris ... where several individuals with arms and explosives launch actions , perhaps even in several places at the same time " .  a statement from the pro league said : " considered a risky game , lokeren had to call in staff from brussels . but given the increase in the terrorist threat to the maximum level in the capital , they can not be moved to lokeren .  " that is why the mayor of lokeren decided , following the advice of the fps home affairs crisis centre , not to allow the game to go ahead . "  anderlecht are the only team in the belgian top division that play in brussels .  the davis cup final between belgium and great britain is due to take place next weekend in ghent , only 35 miles from brussels .  itf president david haggerty , the itf has been in constant contact with the relevant authorities , the royal belgian tennis federation , the lawn tennis association and our risk assessment company , and this dialogue continues today .  " we are aware that belgium has raised the terror alert level for brussels . this greatly concerns us but , at the present time , we are still continuing with preparations for the final .  " what i said last weekend is true today : security of players , fans , media and working staff remains our highest priority . "  the message from the british team so far has been very much that they are keen to carry on as normal , with andy murray saying : " i do n't want to live my life in fear each time i step on a tennis court .
