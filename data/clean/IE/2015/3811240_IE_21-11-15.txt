Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said the decision to raise the threat alert to the highest level was taken " based on quite precise information about the risk of an attack like the one that happened in Paris ... where several individuals with arms and explosives launch actions , perhaps even in several places at the same time " .  A statement from the Pro League said : " Considered a risky game , Lokeren had to call in staff from Brussels . But given the increase in the terrorist threat to the maximum level in the capital , they can not be moved to Lokeren .  " That is why the mayor of Lokeren decided , following the advice of the FPS Home Affairs crisis centre , not to allow the game to go ahead . "  Anderlecht are the only team in the Belgian top division that play in Brussels .  The Davis Cup final between Belgium and Great Britain is due to take place next weekend in Ghent , only 35 miles from Brussels .  ITF president David Haggerty , the ITF has been in constant contact with the relevant authorities , the Royal Belgian Tennis Federation , the Lawn Tennis Association and our risk assessment company , and this dialogue continues today .  " We are aware that Belgium has raised the terror alert level for Brussels . This greatly concerns us but , at the present time , we are still continuing with preparations for the final .  " What I said last weekend is true today : security of players , fans , media and working staff remains our highest priority . "  The message from the British team so far has been very much that they are keen to carry on as normal , with Andy Murray saying : " I do n't want to live my life in fear each time I step on a tennis court .
