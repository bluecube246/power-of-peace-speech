it was an unlucky final round for the two limerick contestants taking part in the great irish bake off , as monaghan woman cathy mckenna was instead crowned ireland 's champion amateur baker .  fighting for the top prize on sunday night were south circular road financial advisor emer hough and fedamore teacher clare ryan .  in the grand finale , the three finalists were given their most complex task ; to bake a deconstructed apple crumble to michelin-star standard , followed by the show-stopper -- the construction of a 20-inch tall , three-tier wedding cake .  clare , who is a teacher at thomond primary school , finished her campaign with a wedding cake that consisted of a dark and white chocolate biscuit cake layer with raspberry ganache ; a coconut cake with blueberry and passion fruit curd ; and a third layer of peanut cake with peanut caramel filling .  and for emer 's final attempt to woo the judges , her three layers consisted of chocolate and salted caramel ; a lemon and blueberry tier ; and a " rainbow showdown and eight gruelling weeks of baking , the two limerick girls did not return home with the great irish bake off title .  after the decision , emer said : " unfortunately today did n't go well but that does n't cancel out all the experiences that came before that . i am delighted i came , i really am . "  commenting on the final bake-off result , clare said : " i 'd definitely make a wedding cake again but just not one in five hours ! "  speaking of the decision , judge paul kelly said : " that was one of the toughest decisions we have ever made in a final , it was so close . "  days before the final , emer said she was expecting the final showdown to be " nail-biting " . she said that her local rival clare was also a close companion throughout the series .  " clare is a really lovely person and i get on really , really well with her . it was lovely to be able to moan about the steady , bake ! ' and then three hours later , there 's clare with something amazing . every single time , she really pulls it out of the bag . clare 's an incredibly talented baker .
