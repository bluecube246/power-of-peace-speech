The mandarin , which originated in China , has over the years , under gone the necessary changes . The best known are the Clementine and Satsuma . According to Dick Pijpers there is little trace of the original mandarin . " By breeding and selection you always get another , better fruit than the original . "  Seasons for the mandarins which came fore mostly from Spain have significantly expanded , they used to appear just before the Christmas market . " This was the Mediterranean mandarin , which has a very typical old-fashioned taste and odour , and gave you a mouth full of pits . " Dick says that this taste can no longer be found in contemporary mandarins . " They are no longer related to the Mediterranean mandarin . " This does have to be , according to him , negative . " The grower chooses a good technical product cultivation , that have little need for plant protection products , and are resistant to frost . " Also , the season is now expanded with both early and late varieties to in vitro techniques , they may even be cultured without the use of seeds . "  Many growers have gone into the cultivation of new varieties because they could no longer earn a living with the old mandarin varieties . " In the trade it goes on returns . "  Reverting to older breeds with the taste of the Mediterranean mandarin will never disappear . The Tardive , a race known in Europe as the Mediterranean mandarin , is still available . The supply comes mainly from Sicily ( Italy ) , and runs from January to April . According to Dick , there are more and more producers again reverting to the old races , just to stand out from the crowd . " Also , we see consumers going back to taste . "
