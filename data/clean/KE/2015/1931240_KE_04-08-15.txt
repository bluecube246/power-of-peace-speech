Bahati courted controversy after he dropped his latest hit featuring two secular artists , King Kaka and Wyre .  While ' Kuchu Kuchu ' is fairing interestingly well on local charts , criticisms have also kept on shadowing the gospel star . Even Bahati 's loyal fans have also raised their voices regarding the controversial song .  So where did the issue of a girl exposing her thighs in Bahati 's video emanate from ? The singer came out to announce ' Kuchu Kuchu ' had garnered over 100k views on YouTube for the first week since it was uploaded .  A fan , Jaymes Rodriguez , was however quick to remind him his song went viral because it featured a girl parading her thighs .  The Jaymes claims views in ' Kuchu Kuchu ' increased because people read Daily Nation last Friday where they were informed there was a girl in Bahati 's video dancing while exposing her thighs .
