when you think about nairobi county , what automatically comes to mind is a bunch of mean looking , rungu-wielding askaris out to get you and whoderive some form of pleasure by terrorizing the residents of nairobi .  you think about corruption , nepotism , long queues , running battles- basically everything evil.at least the sonko rescue team has lightened up things a little bit with the presence of some beautiful lasses which have got everyone 's tongue wagging .  but let 's step aside for a moment and allow me to let you in on another side of nairobi county that is determined to make service delivery easier and efficient for all nairobi residents and which recently introduced ejiipay .  for those who do n't yet know , allow me to school you . ejiji pay is an online payment platform that seeks to make your life easier . ( gasp ! ) i 'm talking parking fees , business permits , land rates , rent and basically anything you might owe the county government .  so go ahead and wish those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
