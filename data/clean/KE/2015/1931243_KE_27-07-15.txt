<p> After opening his City account in his first appearance against Roma , Sterling went one better in Hanoi as he scored twice in 12 minutes against a national team ranked joint 143rd in the world . <p> The former Liverpool forward was not the only City player to find the back of the net twice in the Vietnamese capital , with Aleksandar Kolarov and David Silva also replicating the feat . <p> Substitutes Marcos Lopez and Jose Angel Pozo completed the rout - before Van Quyet scored a late consolation for the hosts - as the Premier League team cruised to a comfortable triumph . <p> It took City 11 minutes to open the scoring as Kolarov curled home a free-kick after Navas had been felled on the edge of the penalty area . <p> The Serbian opted for placement over power as - at the second attempt - he sent the ball around the Vietnam wall and into the bottom-left corner . <p> Sterling quickly muscled his way into the action and after 20 minutes had his second City goal , the England international executing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Less than a minute later , Silva added City 's third after being gifted far too much space by the Vietnam defence , the Spaniard 's initial header hitting the bar before he turned in the rebound . <p> A rampant performance from Pellegrini 's side showed no signs of relenting as Sterling -- who had recovered from a knock to the back -- netted again with a cool finish from Kelechi Iheanacho 's pass . <p> Sterling 's hat-trick moment appeared to have arrived five minutes after the break as he was felled in the penalty area , but he was denied the chance as stand-in captain Kolarov converted from the spot . <p> Silva joined Sterling and Kolarov with a double just after the hour as his last touch brought City 's sixth goal , the diminutive playmaker lifting the ball over Loi from Sterling 's pass . <p> Despite a host of changes in the second half , City 's continued to push for more and they were rewarded after 74 minutes as Lopes ' scuffed effort crept under substitute goalkeeper Nguyen Thanh Diep . <p> Pozo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Vietnam as Van Quyet grabbed a consolation in stoppage time , the striker deftly lobbing the advancing Willy Caballero.
