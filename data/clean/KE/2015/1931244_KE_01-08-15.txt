messi , of course , has spent his entire professional career to date at camp nou and he was joined in catalunya by brazil superstar neymar in 2013 , while suarez arrived from liverpool last summer .  uruguay international suarez was only able to make his blaugrana debut in october , as he was still serving a four-month ban for biting italy defender giorgio chiellini at brazil 2014 , and the striker initially took time to settle in his new surroundings .  however , he went on to play a key role in barca 's treble triumph , with suarez , messi and neymar racking up a record-breaking 122 goals between them as the catalans claimed la liga , the copa del rey and the champions league .  " everyone knows it 's the best forward line in world football , " former barca midfielder keita told the club 's official website . " it was unreal for them to score as many goals as they did last season .  " and it 's also unreal for a team to have three strikers suarez suspended for four months things worked out very well for them . "  keita , of course , was part of the barca squad that won the treble in 2009 , under pep guardiola , but he was reluctant to compare pep guardiola 's side to the current team .  however , the roma midfielder fully expects luis enrique 's men to add the supercopa de espana , uefa super cup and club world cup to their collection before the year is out .  " it 's hard to compare two very different times , " keita added . " now they can win all six titles as well .  " it is much harder to win the treble than the sextet . it takes five games to win the two super cups and the club world cup , a lot less than winning the champions league or la liga .  " i would n't say the job is already done , but they are very close and they have the squad to do it . "
