Messi , of course , has spent his entire professional career to date at Camp Nou and he was joined in Catalunya by Brazil superstar Neymar in 2013 , while Suarez arrived from Liverpool last summer .  Uruguay international Suarez was only able to make his Blaugrana debut in October , as he was still serving a four-month ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at Brazil 2014 , and the striker initially took time to settle in his new surroundings .  However , he went on to play a key role in Barca 's treble triumph , with Suarez , Messi and Neymar racking up a record-breaking 122 goals between them as the Catalans claimed La Liga , the Copa del Rey and the Champions League .  " Everyone knows it 's the best forward line in world football , " former Barca midfielder Keita told the club 's official website . " It was unreal for them to score as many goals as they did last season .  " And it 's also unreal for a team to have three strikers Suarez suspended for four months things worked out very well for them . "  Keita , of course , was part of the Barca squad that won the treble in 2009 , under Pep Guardiola , but he was reluctant to compare Pep Guardiola 's side to the current team .  However , the Roma midfielder fully expects Luis Enrique 's men to add the Supercopa de Espana , Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup to their collection before the year is out .  " It 's hard to compare two very different times , " Keita added . " Now they can win all six titles as well .  " It is much harder to win the treble than the sextet . It takes five games to win the two Super Cups and the Club World Cup , a lot less than winning the Champions League or la Liga .  " I would n't say the job is already done , but they are very close and they have the squad to do it . "
