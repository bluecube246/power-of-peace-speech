the president held talks with top sports officials on friday after wada said kenya did not comply with its anti-drugs code , throwing doubt onathletes ' participation in the rio olympics .  kenya passed legislation in april to criminalise doping , but wada said on thursday it needed to make changes to ensure compliance with the code , which sets a framework for consistent rules and policies around the world .  kenya , for decades a leading power in middle- and long-distance running , now faces the risk of missing the august 5-21 games in rio de janeiro if the international olympic committee so decides .  president uhuru kenyatta , sports cs hassan wario and others met " over wada compliance issues " , state house spokesman manoah esipisu wrote on his twitter account . he did not give further details .  wada had given kenya until may to enact the anti-doping law or be declared non-compliant . the president signed the new legislation into law on april 22 .  but wada president craig reedie said on thursday that it was not we have been working with kenya for a number of years and thought we had agreed that the draft legislation and rules were entirely compliant , " he said .  " it would appear that during their parliamentary process changes were made that unfortunately were n't code-compliant , so we will be in touch with kenya to try and resolve that at the earliest possible moment . "  kenyan athletes won two gold medals , four silvers and five bronze at the last olympics in london .  up to 40 kenyan athletes have failed doping tests since 2012 , the biggest name among them being former three-time boston city marathon and chicago marathon champion , rita jeptoo , now serving a ban .  kenyan running great kipchoge keino , who is chairman of the national olympic committee ofkenya ( nock ) , called wada 's move " very unfortunate " but said his government had not acted quickly enough against doping .  thank you for participating in discussions on the star , kenya . note that :  unwarranted personal abuse and defamatory statements will be by facts and arguments .
