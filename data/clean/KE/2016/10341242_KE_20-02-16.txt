<h> Is the economic contribution of grandparents underrated ? <p> A grandparent , Mburu Mwikonyi now 93 . He fought in Burma during WWII , Mau Mau and spent time in detention . He lives near Nyahururu on the former white highlands . PHOTO : X.N IRAKI <p> NAIROBI : We all look forward to aging gracefully when one day we shall watch our grandchildren chasing butterflies or running around in the rain . <p> With pride we will look back at the economic contribution we made to the country , while ensuring the perpetuation of human race . Looking at Kenya 's rising life expectancy , there is no doubt that the country will boast of more grandparents in future . <p> In Kenya , everyone , from policy makers to churches seem focused on the youth . That is not unusual , the vibrancy of the youth attract a lot of attention , not necessary good . The youth have energy and are valued economically ; they work long hours , at times for low pay and are very innovative . <p> Advertisers use them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good old days . The youth are well represented in crime and other vices , courtesy of energy . Crime demands lots of energy . The politicians see their numbers as the route to power through voting or hired muscle men to intimidate opponents . <p> But with time , we all age . While being called Mzee is a sign of respect , the person being called so does not really appreciate it , if he or she can be sincere . Recently someone sent me a video clip of a three-year-old crying for being told she is three . She did not want to be old like her grandparents . We seem to fear aging quite early . Nothing makes most people happier than when you misjudge his or her age downwards . <p> Entrepreneurs know we would like to stay forever young . They make money selling lot of anti-aging products from hair dyes to drugs ( including Viagra ) and cosmetics . And the market is big . Even entertainment industry has not been left behind . One local FM radio station has built its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when the current middle aged men and women were young . There is something nostalgic when you listen to a song which was a hit when you were in form one or two . <p> One unintended consequence of aging is that you become lonelier . Children often leave home and rarely return , except around Christmas or if you have a problem . That loneliness scares me and a lot of other people . Some grandparents are lucky and are taken care of by their children , while in the west they stay in nursing homes ; though that is catching up in Kenya . <p> Loneliness follows the elderly to the nursing homes . Holding all factors constant , the best place to age is in your home , surrounded by familiar sites and people . With age , we lose our energy to perform economic tasks , culminating in retirement . That does not mark the end of economic usefulness . What role do the elderly , the grandparents play in our economy ? Can we capture that in our GDP ? <p> First , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy . Economic growth is driven by both consumption and investment . The exact balance depends on the state of economy on growth . Grandparents consume lots of products and services . One service they create a huge demand in is medical . <p> Research shows that most of our medical expenses come early in life and later in the life . Kenya 's proportion of the elderly is small compared with say Japan , but it 's expected to rise . Future entrepreneurs should better note . Two , grandparents contributed to the economic growth when they were working through savings . That could be their private savings or compulsory ones like pension or insurance . That pension was not laying idle waiting for their retirement , it was invested . The beauty about pension is that its mandatory and lots of money is pooled together . If it 's well invested , it could make a big difference to the economy . Pension forms one of the most reliable source of investment . <p> Three , grandparents take care of the next generation . There are a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that very common in America 's Deep South . Some feel the grandparents are idle , and their slack time can be used in bringing up kids . The negative part of this is that grandparents are usually very kind , and likely to be spoilt kids . In some families there are strict guidelines that children should never be brought up by grandparents . <p> With rising number of children born to unmarried mothers , the number of kids raised by grandparents could rise . Some argue that grandparents should be left alone to age gracefully without the hustles of raising kids . Others argue they are rewarded for taking care of the next generation . It is keeps them company and busy while kids ' parents take care of their basic needs .
