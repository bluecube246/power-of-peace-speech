National Environment Management Authority ( NEMA ) has attributed politics to the continued pollution of Lake Victoria by car wash operators .  NEMA Kisumu Regional Coordinator Anthony Sairi has said politicking about the removal of all car wash operations from Lake Victoria has denied environmental managers a chance to stop degradation done to the lake and its species .  " Efforts to remove all car wash attendants from the lake have been met with opposition , where some leader are using it as a tool to gain political mileage , " said Sairi .  In a statement released on Saturday Sairi said that unscrupulous people have taken over the car wash and it has become hard to remove them as they enjoy political protection .  " We should look beyond politics , and focus on the conservation of the lake . Without this lake many things in the region will be affected with the continued pollution by car wash operators puts it a greater risk , " said Sairi .  Sairi said that it is time that car owners took responsibility of washing their cars as it will starve people involved at the car wash , " read the statement .  Sairi called on the enforcement arms lead by the Kisumu City management to support the fight of ending the lake pollution menace that is becoming a big threat .
