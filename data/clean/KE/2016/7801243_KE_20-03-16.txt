Chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission ( IEBC ) Mr Issack Hassan defended his commission that it was ready and well prepared for next year 's General Election .  IEBC , he said , has put its staff through a continuous training program by the government of South Korea in readiness for the poll .  " The Treasury had also agreed to bring forward a portion of our 2017/2018 budget in addition to 2016/2017 requests to make our work easier , " he said .  Speaking to The Standard on Sunday , the Chairman said this time round there will be no green books but only one register at the polling station , the ward , constituency and county levels .  " We have adequate Electronic Voter Identification device ( EVID ) for all polling stations , and results will be scanned and posted on the commission website as they happen to address accuracy issues . The commission will publish the entire register on its website and share copies with every political party for inspection and verification , " he said Hassan said political leaders rubbishing the image of the IEBC were doing a great disservice to the country .
