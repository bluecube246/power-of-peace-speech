chairman of the independent electoral and boundaries commission ( iebc ) mr issack hassan defended his commission that it was ready and well prepared for next year 's general election .  iebc , he said , has put its staff through a continuous training program by the government of south korea in readiness for the poll .  " the treasury had also agreed to bring forward a portion of our 2017/2018 budget in addition to 2016/2017 requests to make our work easier , " he said .  speaking to the standard on sunday , the chairman said this time round there will be no green books but only one register at the polling station , the ward , constituency and county levels .  " we have adequate electronic voter identification device ( evid ) for all polling stations , and results will be scanned and posted on the commission website as they happen to address accuracy issues . the commission will publish the entire register on its website and share copies with every political party for inspection and verification , " he said hassan said political leaders rubbishing the image of the iebc were doing a great disservice to the country .
