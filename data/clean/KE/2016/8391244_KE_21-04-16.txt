coalition for reforms and democracy cord 's push for a referendum to ammend the constitution will fail , again .  cord members had tried pushing for the referendum by collecting signatures but they failed when the independent electoral and boundary commission , iebc rejected the signatures on account that they did not meet the required threshold number of 1 million .  now the cord executive committee co-chairs johnstone muthama , who is also machakos senator and james orengo , siaya senator have announced that they will camp in front of the iebc offices on monday until the commission clears them to go on with the referendum .  the push for referendum will fail because cord is still dealing with the same iebc officials who failed them last time .  aptly put , cord is dealing with the same " monkey " in a different forest . a new referendum , and indeed any other fair electoral processes , is only possible under a newly constituted iebc.
