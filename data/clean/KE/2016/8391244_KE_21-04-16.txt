<p> Coalition for reforms and democracy Cord 's push for a referendum to ammend the constitution will fail , again . <p> Cord members had tried pushing for the referendum by collecting signatures but they failed when the Independent electoral and boundary commission , IEBC rejected the signatures on account that they did not meet the required threshold number of 1 million . <p> Now the Cord executive committee co-chairs Johnstone Muthama , who is also Machakos senator and James Orengo , Siaya senator have announced that they will camp in front of the IEBC offices on Monday until the commission clears them to go on with the referendum . <p> The push for referendum will fail because Cord is still dealing with the same IEBC officials who failed them last time . <p> Aptly put , Cord is dealing with the same " monkey " in a different forest . A new referendum , and indeed any other fair electoral processes , is only possible under a newly constituted IEBC.
