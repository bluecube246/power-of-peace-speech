Supreme Court protected and cannot be disbanded

supreme court protected and can not be disbanded  some critics of the supreme court are smoking something . they are " high " on drama . otherwise how can any sane lawyer -- or politician -- call for the disbandment of the supreme court ? the term " disband " the supreme court is not native to the constitution . it 's an idiom that 's baseless in law and fact , and strange to the ears of kenya 's democracy . it 's a nuclear option that 's only possible if the constitution is overthrown in a revolution , or coup d ' ? tat . " disbanding " the supreme court is akin to overthrowing the constitution . let 's not conflate the moral emptiness -- and alleged illegal conduct -- of some of the supreme court judges with the institution of the supreme court . two plus two does n't equal six .  i fully understand the anger -- but in most cases -- the righteous indignation of some of the mandarins baying for the supreme court 's blood . most of hands . let 's take majority leader aden duale , for example . mr duale is like a robot stuck on repeat . he sees cj willy mutunga 's ghost wherever he turns . he ca n't seem to open his mouth without attacking dr mutunga . yet dr mutunga has never in his long legal and public career ever been implicated in single act of corruption . it 's dr mutunga who 's doing what no other cj has done in history -- defrock corrupt judges . he has initiated far-reaching changes in the judiciary . there are courts in far-flung corners of the republic for the first time .  why would mr duale point fingers at dr mutunga when the national assembly is reeking of corruption ? speaker justin muturi beat a hasty retreat when mps threatened to decapitate him over an eacc report that found massive fraud within the august house . i did n't hear mr duale call for mr. muturi 's resignation . nor has he called for the resignation of his political mentors or associates who have been implicated in corrupt scandals . one vendetta against cj mutunga . perhaps he wants cj mutunga out of the way so that his side can push for a partisan chief justice . a head of one of the arms of government to should n't launch bilious attacks against his counterparts .  mr duale 's claim against dr mutunga is that the cj has " condoned " corruption in the judiciary . mr duale needs to choose his words carefully . how exactly has cj mutunga " condoned " corruption ? is n't the cj fighting corrupt cartels tooth and nail ? in fact , one could make the case that jubilee 's uhuru kenyatta -- kenya 's ceo -- is the one who has condoned corruption in the executive in spite of empty anti-corruption talk . that 's because unlike cj mutunga , mr kenyatta can actually fire corrupt officers . tellingly , mr kenyatta has n't cracked the whip , except when he reluctantly let go several ministers exposed in corruption scandals . i did n't hear mr duale call for mr kenyatta 's resignation .  i am not saying that justices of the allegations of graft or abuse of office . the constitution provides a clear process of bringing corrupt judges to book . but picking on individual judges is n't the same thing as picking on the court itself . you ca n't -- and should n't -- throw the baby out with the bathwater . if individual justices are suspected of misconduct and corruption , then let the axe fall on them as individuals . but do n't go for cj mutunga 's neck as a proxy for bringing down the entire court . i believe this is the same tactic used by mps to neuter the eacc and make it a compliant wing of the executive .  there 's no doubt the matter of justice of philip tunoi is scandalous . the accusation against him -- if proven -- will be astounding . in the event , nairobi governor evans kidero would have no choice but to resign in disgrace and face prosecution . more damaging will be the implication of such a finding on the other four judges who sat on that bench . it does n't take a not command four votes absent culpability by the others . as they say , one apple would taint the whole bunch . but we are a long way from there . let 's not crucify justice tunoi , or the others , before all the evidence is tendered .  finally , let 's say the obvious -- kenya needs an unimpeachable supreme court . dr mutunga is retiring from the bench soon . his successor must be a person of the highest ethical and scholarly standards . the next cj will have to finish what cj mutunga started . that 's why his successor must fight corruption in the judiciary without pity . that 's why all the sitting justices of the supreme court must look in the mirror . they should go if they are tainted , and not destroy the supreme court by holding on .
