<h> Uganda must embrace a fair electoral process <p> Even before Yoweri Museveni had been declared President , observers of the Ugandan elections were unequivocal . They concluded that the process was unfair , lacked credibility and was marked by irregularities . <p> But this deduction had been expected after the main opposition candidate Kizza Besigye was arrested three times as the tallying was going on . According to the 13-nation Commonwealth Observer Group led by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo , voter bribery and the misuse of state resources undermined the electoral process . The observers also raised issues about the competence , credibility and ability of the Electoral Commission to conduct fair elections and were particularly unhappy with the delays of supply of voting material to polling stations , particularly in Kampala . <p> Yet such election infractions are common in Africa . By and large , most African countries have made a transition where there are cyclical elections that pave way for grassroots and nationals leaders to be elected to form representative governments under the duly elected head of state . However , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these elections -- like the Ugandan case has demonstrated -- are seldom , credible . Often times violence has resulted when the outcome has been disputed , and Kenyans are only too familiar with such consequences from the lessons learnt in 2007/2008 . After more than 1,000 deaths in Kenya 's 2007 General Election , recommendations for electoral reforms have largely been implemented , but mischief and mutual suspicion of the protagonists is undiminished . <p> It is not just elections that invite violence as recent events in Burundi demonstrated . Here the controversy over President Pierre Nkurunziza 's term limit led to an abortive coup d'etat and sporadic killings as the Bujumbura government cracked down on demonstrators . <p> Africa is replete with such examples . Yet the continent provided one of the best examples of a leader who readily gave up power so that others could carry the leadership mantle . Nelson Mandela resisted pressure to run for a second term and graciously allowed others to take over after being elected as the first black president in post-Apartheid South Africa . <p> African leaders must borrow from this legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hold on to power even when their time to relinquish office has come , do a great disservice to those they govern .
