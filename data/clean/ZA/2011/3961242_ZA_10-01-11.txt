TUT warns of enrolment cons  The Tshwane University of Technology ( TUT ) will this week process late applications from students who continue to queue up for enrolment .  The institution has warned that this is also a season when criminals tend to take advantage of desperate applicants .  TUT spokesman Gilbert Mokwatedi said the institution could only take in 12 549 first-year students even though they had received 32 188 applications from 2010 .  Mokwatedi said most courses were already full and warned prospective students against giving money to any individual who promised to secure them a place at the institution .  Mokwatedi also warned parents against sending their children on their own to look for a place as they could fall prey to criminals .  " As parents would be sending their children to different institutions of higher learning , TUT appeals to parents not to send their children unaccompanied , especially in cases where students have to travel long distances .  " Some victims could end up losing their parents ' hard-earned cash , " he said TUT officials or paid at banking facilities .  " Do n't hand over money or your documents to anyone who promises you access to an institution of higher learning .  " Most universities have payment facilities at their registration points or they refer students to banking facilities where students can make necessary deposits into legitimate accounts of such universities , " he said .  According to Mokwatedi , the university does not provide any accommodation to unregistered students or prospective students who are looking for a place . - Pretoria News
