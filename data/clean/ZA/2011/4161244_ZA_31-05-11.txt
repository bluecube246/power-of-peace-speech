<p> " We are quite pleased that the court has found in our favour ... R100 000 is quite a reasonable amount , " said SAHRC spokesperson Vincent Moaga . <p> " The focus is not on the money , but the message coming out of this . With recent hate speech and crimes against the community , the court is sending positive messages , " he said . <p> The SAHRC initiated court proceedings in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act . <p> Qwelane did not make much of an appearance in the course of the trial . He failed to sign court papers presented to him by a clerk and did not file responding papers . <p> The court ruled that , as it had only one version of the story , the SAHRC 's argument would be accepted . <p> " From here , we will have to look at the judgment and make sure that Qwelane abides by the court order , " Moaga said . <p> In 2008 , the press ombudsman found the paper was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ombudsman Joe Thloloe received nearly 1 000 complaints after the paper published the column , he said in a statement on July 29 2008 . <p> Thloloe found that the thrust of the column was a call for a revision of the country 's Constitution to take away the rights that gays and lesbians had won in the new South Africa . <p> " This is the same type of debate as those on the death penalty and on proportional representation . Debates about amendments to the Constitution are protected under the freedom of speech clauses of the Constitution . Qwelane has the right to call for amendments . " <p> ' Well within the law ' Although Qwelane expressed reservations about homosexuality and put down gays and lesbians , he did not advocate hatred or the harming of gays and lesbians . <p> " It is robust language , but not hate speech , " said Thloloe . <p> He also did not equate homosexuality with bestiality . <p> " What he does say is that after allowing gay marriages it will not be long before we legalise bestiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on different rungs on a ladder , with bestiality lower . By implication however he is placing heterosexuality higher . " <p> Asked whether the column could lead to violence against gays and lesbians , Thloloe responded : " To me it appears most unlikely . " <p> There was nothing in the column inciting hatred and calling for the harming of homosexuals . <p> " Columnists are protected by the Constitution for as long as their comments do n't propagate war , incite imminent violence and advocate hatred that constitutes incitement to cause harm . <p> " Qwelane was well within the law but fell foul of the press code . " <p> Qwelane is South Africa 's ambassador to Uganda . - Sapa and Staff reporter
