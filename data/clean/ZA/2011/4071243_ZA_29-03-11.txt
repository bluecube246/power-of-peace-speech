<p> As usual the officials when ever they ca n't fix something they always make the process of aquaring or applying for something tedious , apply for anything in SA and see how irritating and tidious the process is , yes the metros need proper training but what happens after training and being admited into the force , they sit all day hiding behind trees , driving around in metro cars , stop at any food they can find , 6 month down the line the result is a fat metropolice , this guys needs to be encouraged to make physical training a daily routin of thier lives , they need to exercise everyday and stay fit , it does n't matter how long you train them at the academy , what happens after is what matters , do they stick to training or do they fall back and enjoy the pig ride . <p> Must be disbanded . I cant make out what thier mandate is : police crime ... or traffic ... or pavements for street vendors ... or evict people from buildings ... or ramdomly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tabza325is@ SPOT ON ... <p> Please , part of their training should include Customer Service . I am sick and tired of rude Metro cops who like to play God whenever they stop you . And YES , let them hit the gym as we are sick and tired of overweight cops . They should also be restricted to go anywhere near fastfood outlets with the exception of when they respond to a crime . <p> @ Bedeyes , I bet you like being stopped by the ladies ba go paka . At least they make you enjoy driving on our roads .
