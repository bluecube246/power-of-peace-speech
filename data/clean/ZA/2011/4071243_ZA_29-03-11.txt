as usual the officials when ever they ca n't fix something they always make the process of aquaring or applying for something tedious , apply for anything in sa and see how irritating and tidious the process is , yes the metros need proper training but what happens after training and being admited into the force , they sit all day hiding behind trees , driving around in metro cars , stop at any food they can find , 6 month down the line the result is a fat metropolice , this guys needs to be encouraged to make physical training a daily routin of thier lives , they need to exercise everyday and stay fit , it does n't matter how long you train them at the academy , what happens after is what matters , do they stick to training or do they fall back and enjoy the pig ride .  must be disbanded . i cant make out what thier mandate is : police crime ... or traffic ... or pavements for street vendors ... or evict people from buildings ... or ramdomly . tabza325is@ spot on ...  please , part of their training should include customer service . i am sick and tired of rude metro cops who like to play god whenever they stop you . and yes , let them hit the gym as we are sick and tired of overweight cops . they should also be restricted to go anywhere near fastfood outlets with the exception of when they respond to a crime .  @ bedeyes , i bet you like being stopped by the ladies ba go paka . at least they make you enjoy driving on our roads .
