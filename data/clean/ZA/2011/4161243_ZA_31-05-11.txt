illegal power lines a ' fire hazard '  with the onset of winter rains , illegal electricity connections that hang precariously low above many city homes are being cited as a major fire hazard .  this was among the frustrations expressed by some residents of the witsand informal settlement , after a fire ripped through the area yesterday morning , leaving one man dead and about 150 people homeless .  resident nolufefe mbombo , 43 , said the combination of illegal connections and rainy weather was " very dangerous " .  " once it rains then you hear the static , and with a lot of wind there 's friction , which cause fires . "  standing amid the scorched remains of what was once people 's homes , mbombo pointed at wires on the ground which might have snapped during the fire .  rass said she had appealed to eskom to provide the area with " legal " electricity .  " tragedies like these can be avoided if we do n't have these illegal electricity connections . water and explained that residents were desperate to generate more heat during the cold spell . but without a safer alternative , they would continue setting up illegal connections .  eskom 's western cape spokeswoman , jolene henn , said that despite having invested millions of rands in campaigns to raise awareness about electricity and safety , the practice of " electricity tapping " still occurred .  " communities are fully aware of the dangers in distributing electricity in the manner they do , but still continue with these unsafe acts . eskom regularly removes illegal connections , but the perpetrators reconnect as soon as staff leave the area . "  henn said eskom would continue treating illegal connections as a " serious social issue " , and engage communities to curb the dangerous practice .  witsand , she added , had been earmarked as part of eskom 's electrification project .  the city 's fire and rescue spokesman , theo layne , said the cause of the witsand fire was still being investigated .  he said that while it was difficult to determine how many homes it was definitely a huge problem .  last year , the fire service recorded more than 1 000 shack fires , and since january this year 400 shack fires had already been reported .  layne said the dangling wires were present in almost all informal settlements , posing a risk not only for residents , but also for firemen .  " each time we respond to a call and have to drive between the overhead wires , we put ourselves and vehicles at risk . "  two firefighters had been shocked by illegal wiring .  due to the poor quality of wire being used , the connections proved " extremely dangerous " .  " this often leads to the wires overheating , short circuits and the insulation being ignited , which spreads rapidly . "
