<h> Illegal power lines a ' fire hazard ' <p> WITH the onset of winter rains , illegal electricity connections that hang precariously low above many city homes are being cited as a major fire hazard . <p> This was among the frustrations expressed by some residents of the Witsand informal settlement , after a fire ripped through the area yesterday morning , leaving one man dead and about 150 people homeless . <p> Resident Nolufefe Mbombo , 43 , said the combination of illegal connections and rainy weather was " very dangerous " . <p> " Once it rains then you hear the static , and with a lot of wind there 's friction , which cause fires . " <p> Standing amid the scorched remains of what was once people 's homes , Mbombo pointed at wires on the ground which might have snapped during the fire . <p> Rass said she had appealed to Eskom to provide the area with " legal " electricity . <p> " Tragedies like these can be avoided if we do n't have these illegal electricity connections . Water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that residents were desperate to generate more heat during the cold spell . But without a safer alternative , they would continue setting up illegal connections . <p> Eskom 's Western Cape spokeswoman , Jolene Henn , said that despite having invested millions of rands in campaigns to raise awareness about electricity and safety , the practice of " electricity tapping " still occurred . <p> " Communities are fully aware of the dangers in distributing electricity in the manner they do , but still continue with these unsafe acts . Eskom regularly removes illegal connections , but the perpetrators reconnect as soon as staff leave the area . " <p> Henn said Eskom would continue treating illegal connections as a " serious social issue " , and engage communities to curb the dangerous practice . <p> Witsand , she added , had been earmarked as part of Eskom 's electrification project . <p> The city 's Fire and Rescue spokesman , Theo Layne , said the cause of the Witsand fire was still being investigated . <p> He said that while it was difficult to determine how many homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was definitely a huge problem . <p> Last year , the fire service recorded more than 1 000 shack fires , and since January this year 400 shack fires had already been reported . <p> Layne said the dangling wires were present in almost all informal settlements , posing a risk not only for residents , but also for firemen . <p> " Each time we respond to a call and have to drive between the overhead wires , we put ourselves and vehicles at risk . " <p> Two firefighters had been shocked by illegal wiring . <p> Due to the poor quality of wire being used , the connections proved " extremely dangerous " . <p> " This often leads to the wires overheating , short circuits and the insulation being ignited , which spreads rapidly .
