<h> Harrowing tale of drugs has lessons for all <p> Many might be familiar with the Ellen Pakkies story , but as it deals with one of the country 's most devastating problems , the addiction to tik ( crystal meth ) and all its catastrophic results , it is an extremely important story to tell . <p> Pakkies and her husband live in Lavender Hill , one of Cape Town 's notorious drug suburbs . Most families are either directly or indirectly affected by the abundance and availability of the drug and the devastating results as a community tries to battle addiction and the crime and violence that ensue . <p> Pakkies , her husband and son lead a very quiet life . They do n't have money and life is a struggle , but they manage . Then what seems almost like the inevitable happens , their young son succumbs to the peer pressure of the neighbourhood and falls victim to crystal meth . <p> His downward spiral is exposed in this tale of sorrow as a family is destroyed by the powerful addiction of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also cripples the family . It is n't that it only wreaks havoc financially , but emotionally . <p> Ellen has to cope with a child who turns into a monster as his life becomes a nightmare existence of finding money for his habit . <p> His parents become the victims as they are his only source of income . In the final stages of his life , his parents only have the clothes they wear which they wash every night for the next day 's work . Everything they own has been stolen and they live like prisoners in their home as he terrorises and attacks anyone who stands in his way . <p> The thing about the Pakkies ' story is that we know the outcome . This is the story of a mother who kills her child and is finally given a suspended sentence which becomes a benchmark for similar cases in the future . <p> Only at the court case do we learn Pakkies herself is a victim of severe abuse and as her son turns on her and becomes yet another abuser in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing back . <p> Lizz Meiring is the playwright with Vinette Ebrahim and Christo Davids , the duelling mother and son . It is perfect casting , but the performances are still too brash with too much of the pain expressed in sheer volume . A heart-wrenching scene where Ellen can not contain her pain and screams , grabbing a cushion in which she buries the scream is pushed over the edge when she starts banging on the cushion . <p> More of her earlier story could have also have been shared which would underline the horror of someone 's life being pushed to an edge where few will go beyond -- and yet she does . <p> My Name is Ellen Pakkies is a harrowing story , but one that can not be told often enough . <p> l Now My naam is/My name is Ellen Pakkies plays at the Baxter Golden Arrow Studio until May 7 , with a stopover at the Cederberg Arts Festival on May 1 .
