<h> The signs of the times <p> Many storms were raging at this year 's Klein Karoo National Arts Festival ( KKNK ) , with the main point of discussion being the few festivalgoers on the streets of Oudtshoorn , which are usually packed during this annual art jamboree . <p> According to KKNK CEO Brett Pyper , they were expecting a drop in numbers because of the Easter weekend much later in the month and usually a part of the festival . <p> But he was pleased about the redistribution of audiences who could be seen mainly at the crafts market and light music stages called Rivierbuurt and in the theatres . The attendance numbers will be released only in a few weeks ' time , but he was confident that these would reflect his optimism . <p> While some of the shows did n't attract large crowds , others were sold out before the festival , which seemed to also comment on the state of the economy . People seemed to be much more circumspect about their choices . <p> Theatre productions at art festivals often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In this instance , identity , violence and death were the three issues that emerged most strongly with Die Kortstondige Raklewe van Anastasia W and My Naam/Name is Ellen Pakkies most vociferous about violence ( see stories ) . <p> In more simplistic fashion , a group of scholars , part of an annual Cape Town acting competition , turned their story Hel Op Hemel-en-Aarde into a kind of thriller as they led their audience through a maze of clues while chasing the serial killer Hansie Mowers , who terrorised a community in the Overberg a few years ago . <p> What turned this into a theatrical venture with punch was that it was set outside , with the production starting after dark . And the concluding scene put the audience in the centre of the terror as the killer faced down his final victim . <p> On a much more chilling note , Hennie van Greunen presented his adaptation of British playwright David Kelly 's Orphans . Titled Wees , it 's a universal story and plays in macabre fashion with the fears of so many people with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruesome truth in this chamber of horror and one could hear a pin drop through the two-hour production as a young married couple 's dinner is interrupted by the wife 's brother , covered in blood . <p> As the story haltingly unfolds , the suspense builds as the couple are forced to confront their belief system while being drawn into a situation beyond their control . <p> They have to make moral choices that will change all their lives for ever and take a stand on where to side when family is involved . How far can you push those moral boundaries while making excuses for the horrific misdeeds of those close to you ? <p> It plays uncomfortably close to home and asks as much from the audience as Van Greunen does from the actors . He draws taut performances from his trio , especially Andre Weideman and Gustav Gerdener , while Nicola Hanekom still has to come to terms with the rhythms of her character . <p> Hanekom did n't miss a beat in her second site-specific piece ( following last year 's award-winning Betesda ) titled Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A gatekeeper ( Stian Bam ) with keys dangling from his belt is surrounded by a spectacle of clocks as he marches up and down a fence that appears to be some kind of parameter . In short succession , a young woman who has a Rafael Nadal fetish , a young married couple still in their wedding attire and a pop star who is tripping much more than the light fantastic all arrive separately in screeching cars . <p> They are all wounded in some fashion and it soon becomes clear they have arrived at their final destination where they have to make certain decisions about their celestial future . No one is ready to go and the ensuing haggling about their next journey tells many individual stories . <p> Having found her m ? tier of the moment , Hanekom knows how to establish visual impact in all its many facets as she plays with not only light and darkness , but also uses the elements and senses to enhance everything she wants to say . From Neels van Jaarsveld 's sudden shock of bleached hair to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the senses that overwhelms spectacularly . <p> Marthinus Basson 's interpretation of Belgian playwright Laurens de Vos 's Klaasvakie tackles ageing and hovering death in an intriguing way . <p> Two old women cooped up in a retirement home confront their past lives , which are intertwined in some mysterious way . Both play with the memories and minds of the other and one is never sure where reality ends and fantasy begins . <p> Who is telling the truth and what exactly are we dealing with and when is either of the women toying with or torturing the other ? <p> In the mix , there 's also a menacing nurse who adds another twist to this spooky tale . Veteran actress Wilna Snyman gives a glittering performance with Antoinette Kellermann and Nicole Holm in fine fettle . <p> Identity was poignantly illuminated by Dawn Langdown and the Northern Cape Namjive dancers in Mense van Mense . Representing a specific group of people , she gallantly flung open her arms and embraced everyone . In a challenging world where politicians feel they can prescribe where people should live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country had a very clear message . <p> In this instance they were dancing for people who had never seen their own make such strong statements on stage . It was an outside performance and they performed on a huge circle of sand , adding to the elements to further establish their identity -- intermingled with ours . <p> " Who are you ? " they concluded as they reached out to the audience and brought full meaning to the title of their production -- People of People . <p> These are just a small representation of some of the best and the brightest at the festival , but there were many more exploring and examining these burning issues . <p> Hopefully at least more than a handful will be travelling across the country to keep the conversation going .
