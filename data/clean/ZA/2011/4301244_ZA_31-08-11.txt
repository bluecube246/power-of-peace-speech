sars leaks 20 000 e-mail addresses  the sa revenue service ( sars ) earlier this week inadvertently sent 20 000 taxpayers ' e-mail addresses to other taxpayers . the 20 000 addresses in question were the intended recipients of the sars e-mail .  realising the error , sars sent a follow-up e-mail apologising to those affected and requesting that they " immediately delete that email and its attachment " .  it added that sars takes " stringent measures to protect and safeguard the information of taxpayers , including their e-mail addresses " but that " these safeguards failed in this instance due to human error " .  sars said it was conducting a " full investigation " into the incident and wished to assure those affected that it would take " strong action against those responsible " . it said and it would implement " additional measures to further protect taxpayer information " .  in the e-mail , sars also sought to remind those affected that according to the legal restrictions applicable to its e-mail communication no one may further distribute correspondence take the strongest legal action against anyone found to have saved , used or distributed the list of e-mail addresses " .  mark kingon , group executive at sars , says the organisation wants to reiterate that human error was to blame for the erroneous inclusion of taxpayers ' e-mail addresses and that it views the incident " in a very serious light " .  he says sars has suspended some members of staff as a result of the incident and that its investigation is continuing .  sars sends high volumes of e-mail and that in this particular incident e-mails were being sent to over 150 000 employers to notify them of changes relating to sars easyfile service , kingon says .  in an effort to avoid incidents like this one , sars sends e-mails in batches of 20 000 rather than sending them all at once , so that if there is an error it can be corrected before going to the entire database .  " it 's an offence to disseminate or otherwise use those addresses and we will take all available punitive measures kingon. -- craig wilson , techcentral  why techcentral ?  we know that as a prospective advertiser , you are spoilt for choice . our job is to demonstrate why techcentral delivers the best return for your advertising spend .  techcentral is south africa 's online technology news leader . we do n't say that lightly . we believe we produce the country 's best and most insightful online tech news aimed at industry professionals and those interested in the fast-changing world of technology .  we provide news , reviews and comment , without fear or favour , that is of direct relevance to our fast-expanding audience . proportionately , we provide the largest local audience of all technology-focused online publishers .  we do not constantly regurgitate press releases to draw in search engine traffic -- we believe websites that do so are doing their readers and advertisers a disservice . nor do we sell " editorial features " , offer advertising " press offices " or rely on online bulletin-board forums of questionable value to advertisers to bolster our traffic .  techcentral , which is about delivering top-quality content to draw in the business and consumer readers that are of most interest to technology advertisers .  we 'd like the opportunity to demonstrate the value of directing a portion of your advertising budget to techcentral , whether your company is in the technology field or not . numerous opportunities exist for companies interested in reaching our audience of key decision-makers in south africa 's dynamic information and communications technology sector . we offer packages that will deliver among the best returns on investment available in the online technology news space .  for more information about advertising opportunities , and how your organisation can benefit by publicising itself on techcentral , please call us on 011-792-0449 during office hours . or send us an e-mail and ask for our latest rate card and brochure .
