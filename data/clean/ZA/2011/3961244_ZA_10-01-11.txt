<h> Economy <h> SA scores for growth in 2050 study <p> 10 January 2011 An updated study by consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers , " The World in 2050 " , projects that South Africa will be the seventh fastest-growing economy between now and 2050 , with an average annual real growth rate of five percent . Released last week , the revised version of " The World in 2050 " also predicts that in purchasing power parity terms , the E7 group of emerging countries ( China , India , Brazil , Russia , Mexico , Indonesia and Turkey ) will overtake the G7 economies ( US , Japan , Germany , UK , France , Italy and Canada ) by 2020 . " Our key conclusion is that the global financial crisis has further accelerated the shift in global economic power to the emerging economies , " the report says . The original version was published in 2006 , before the 2008-09 crisis . With reference to South Africa , the report projects an average annual population growth rate of 0.3% , and an average annual GDP ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now until 2050 . It ranks South Africa as the world 's twentieth largest economy in 2009 , both in terms of purchasing power parity , with the economy worth US$508-billion , and at market exchange rate rankings , with the economy worth $286-billion . However , by 2050 , South Africa is projected to drop out of the top-20 ranking , where it could be replaced by Nigeria , which has a higher average annual growth rate till 2050 ( at 7.9% ) , a higher average annual growth rate per capita of five percent , and higher average annual population growth rate of 1.5% . Nigeria has the largest expected contribution from population growth over the next 40 years , which will significantly increase its working age population contributing to GDP growth . The study points out , however , that Nigeria 's high growth rate is also subject to a " considerable degree of uncertainty due to its need to address issues relating to current over-dependence on oil and various institutional and governance issues that have held back its growth potential in some past periods " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , China is expected to pass the US as the largest economy in the world , while India could also overtake the US economy , in purchasing power parity terms , by 2050 . The report finds that , even when looking at GDP growth at market exchange rate rankings , the overtaking process is slower , but still inexorable : the Chinese economy would still be likely to be larger than that of the US before 2035 , and the E7 would overtake the G7 before 2040 . In addition , India would be clearly the third-largest economy in the world by 2050 , well ahead of Japan and not too far behind the US . " In many ways this renewed dominance of China and India , with their much larger populations , is a return to the historical norm prior to the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and 19th centuries that caused a shift in global economic power to Western Europe and the US ? this temporary shift in power is now going into reverse , " said one of the report 's authors , PriceWaterhouseCoopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> According to " The World in 2050 " , this changing world order poses both challenges and opportunities for businesses in the current advanced economies . " On the one hand , competition from emerging market multinationals will increase steadily over time and the latter will move up the value chain in manufacturing and some services , including financial services given the weakness of the Western banking system after the crisis . " At the same time , the report predicts , rapid growth in consumer markets in the major emerging economies , associated with a fast-growing middle class , will provide new opportunities for Western companies that can establish themselves in these markets . " These will be highly competitive , so this is not an easy option ? it requires long-term investment ? but without it Western companies will increasingly be playing in the slow lane of history if they continue to focus on markets in North America and Western Europe .
