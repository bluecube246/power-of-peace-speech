<p> Mphela , who scored the winning goal against Egypt on Saturday in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier , was arrested early on Monday morning after celebrating the win , according to Glyn Binkin , the player 's manager . <p> Mphela was driving after purchasing a late-night snack when police pulled him over for a routine stop , Binkin said . <p> " He 's obviously disappointed about what transpired , but he also believed he was under the limit or he would not have taken the irresponsible action of driving when he did n't feel he was able to drive , " Binkin said . <p> " Mphela acted drunk when they pulled him over at about 05:00 , so police brought him to the station for four hours until he was sober enough to be released " , Dlamini said . <p> Mphela scored three minutes into injury time to give South Africa a 1-0 win over Egypt on Saturday . <p> Mphela has been released on R1 000 bail and will appear in court in October . <p> 24. com publishes all comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policy .
