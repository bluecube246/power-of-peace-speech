" mphela acted drunk when they pulled him over at about 05:00 , so police brought him to the station for four hours until he was sober enough to be released " , dlamini said .  mphela scored three minutes into injury time to give south africa a 1-0 win over egypt on saturday .  mphela has been released on r1 000 bail and will appear in court in october .  24. com publishes all comments policy . should you wish to report a comment for editorial review , please do so by clicking the ' report comment ' button to the right of each comment .  featured  as the absa premiership nears the christmas break , a little over half the season remains . who will be crowned champions
