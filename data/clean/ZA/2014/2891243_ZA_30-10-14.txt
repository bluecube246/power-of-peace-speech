violence holds a huge cost for our world . globally the cost runs to more than 11% of the world 's gdp . but this is not mostly about the highly visible violence that dominates tv and news .  civil wars and conflicts rumble far too long in far too many places like syria and the sudans , and they are devastating for those involved . economists have measured the costs of all such conflict , from the death toll from civil wars , regular wars , terrorism along with the costs of refugees but also including the way conflicts can blight countries ' economic growth for decades .  yet , their total impact , though important in specific hot-spots , is globally fairly small , with a total cost of about 0.2% of global gdp .  but surprisingly , other forms of violence are likely a much greater problem and they certainly deserve more of the world 's attention . this is the argument by james fearon and anke hoeffler in a new research paper for the copenhagen consensus .  take the , roughly nine people are murdered . if you measure the total cost , not just of homicides but assaults and the fear associated with these , the global cost runs to more than 1.4% of gdp . for sub-saharan africa , because of higher crime rate , the cost is nearly 4% of the region 's gdp .  this does not mean that the region loses some $86-billion each year from this violence , but rather that if we could avoid these murders and assaults , the region would be better off in a way that would be comparable with everyone being 4% richer .  but even murders are not the most important part of violence . the most devastating impact of violence comes from two areas that are often neglected , and the economic analysis shows us why we need to give them much more attention .  abuse costs morethe first area is child abuse : across the world , many children still have a very violent upbringing . almost all parents use non-violent discipline like explaining why a certain behaviour was wrong and perhaps taking 15% of all children experience what the united nations calls severe physical punishment . they are being slapped on the face , head and ears and 4% are even being beat up with an implement , being hit over and over as hard as possible . this is the fate of 290-million children across the world each month , with 125-million occurring in sub-saharan africa .  the economists estimate the cost of such child assault , not just from the obvious costs of increased child welfare interventions , but also from the well-documented loss of future earnings from an assaulted child . the total global cost reaches an astounding $3.5-trillion annually . for south africa , the cost is estimated at $82-billion .  violence against women is the biggest global cost , and it includes female infanticide , genital mutilation and incitement for widows to commit suicide . but far bigger is the cost of intimate partner violence , including being slapped , pushed , shoved , kicked , choked , burnt on purpose and forced to sex . over the past year , this violence afflicted more than cost of such violence against women runs to $4.4-trillion per year , or about $91-billion just for south africa . together with violence against children , the social cost of violence reaches almost $173-billion in south africa annually .  best targetsthe world and the un is trying to answer the question : what kind of world do you want in 2030 ? the focus is to find the best targets for the world to concentrate on .  that is why my think-tank , copenhagen consensus , has asked some of the world 's top economists to look at the economic , social and environmental costs and benefits of many different proposed targets , from areas like health , food and education to the thorny question of violence .  the economists find that a target to reduce civil wars could be achieved with more active deployment of peacekeeping forces . while costly , these could help prevent future civil wars , and the analysis shows that each dollar spent could do between $2 and $7 worth of good . they also find changing alcohol laws could partially reduce assaults assaults so much that the benefits outweighed cost 17 to one .  to reduce violence against women and girls , one program in uganda , called sasa ! ( kiswahili meaning " now ! " ) promotes the view that violence against a partner is unacceptable , and has halved the level of violence . while such a program seems like a great idea , we still do n't have the analysis to show how much good it does for each dollar .  reducing violence against children could be helped by strengthening social services . studies from washington state show that home visitation programs can reduce child abuse and hence reduce both further spending on child welfare and litigation , while helping the children avoid medical , mental health and quality of life costs . for each dollar spent the benefits could reach $13 to $14 .  we now need to start a conversation about which targets for the world we want to set . knowing the costs and benefits on how to reduce violence is one part of that puzzle .  dr. bj ? rn lomborg directs the copenhagen consensus center , ranking the smartest solutions to the world 's biggest problems by cost-benefit . he is the author of the skeptical environmentalist and cool it . his new book is how to spend $75-billion to make the world a better place .
