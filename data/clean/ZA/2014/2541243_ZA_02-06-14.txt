<h> PARTY <h> Baby that died at Dobsonville clinic was not stillborn - DENOSA <p> DENOSA Gauteng Challenges claims by Gauteng Health spokesperson that the baby that died at Itireleng , Soweto , was stillborn <p> DENOSA Gauteng fully challenges claims made by the Gauteng Health spokesperson , Simon Zwane , on the media that the baby that died on Friday at Itireleng clinic in Soweto was a stillborn ; we want to put on record that the baby was born at 2 pm and died at 3:25pm due to the harsh condition it was exposed to and the malfunctioning tools of trade at the clinic . <p> A stillborn is never resuscitated because there is no need and in this case resuscitation took place because it was necessary but unfortunately due to the malfunctioning of machines and other harsh conditions it was unsuccessful . <p> We advise Mr Zwane to do his homework in future before rushing to comment on things he has no information and background on . DENOSA was present on site during the whole incident . <p> We call on the Gauteng department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apologise and assist the mother with the funeral of the baby and further move with speed to correct the situation .
