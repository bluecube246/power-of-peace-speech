A biscuit to beat malnutrition  Pretoria - These are not the biscuits your grandmother used to bake . These biscuits are high in protein and antioxidants , they are gluten-free and rich in dietary fibre , are inexpensive to make and can turn the unemployed into entrepreneurs .  They are tasty too .  Food science and nutrition graduates , along with Professor John Taylor of the University of Pretoria ( UP ) , have spent the better part of 10 years developing a healthy alternative to the average , normally unhealthy , snack .  Over the years , several graduates students from various African countries have worked on the project . What they have come up with is a sorghum and cowpeas biscuit that is more nutritious than the snacks people wolf down at their desks .  " These biscuits can go a long way to combat protein-energy malnutrition , " Taylor said .  Taylor , who has been working with sorghum since 1979 , said at least 20 percent of South Africans were undernourished and protein-energy malnutrition was more common especially children -- do not get enough energy from their food and the little protein they ingest is used for energy .  Taylor and his team worked out that they could use sorghum , an indigenous grain , and cowpeas , a legume , to develop a biscuit that would nourish people and could be a means of earning an income .  It could even be incorporated into the government 's school feeding scheme .  Instead of eating unhealthy snacks bought from vendors outside the school gates , children could snack on these biscuits .  Because sub-Saharan Africa is the most food-insecure region in the world -- and it is expected the population of these countries will double by 2050 -- there is a need to develop and support agricultural activities in these countries .  Cowpeas and sorghum are indigenous to Africa and easier to grow than wheat . They are also resistant to drought .  " South Africa is running out of water and grains under irrigation will not be an option in future . We can not use drinking water for grains because Taylor said .  The biscuits were simple and inexpensive to make and in a country where 30 percent to 40 percent of people were unemployed they could be a source of income .  " Normally vendors sell perishables such as fruit or vegetables . If they do n't sell them today , it will be rotten and not fit to eat by tomorrow . But the biscuits can be sold today , tomorrow or in a few weeks . "  Because the biscuits contain only about three percent water -- as opposed to bread , which is 40 percent water -- they are " shelf-stable " and do n't perish as quickly as other snacks . Because of the low percentage of moisture , the biscuits are considered nutrient-dense . They also digest slowly , keeping people satisfied for longer .  " From a nutritional point of view this is a good product . "  The biscuits are ready-to-eat and do not require cooking or other effort once baked and packaged .  It was not easy to develop the biscuits . " We had to to make biscuits , " he said .  The gluten in wheat holds baked goods together . Because sorghum contains no gluten , it was a technical challenge to develop a working recipe .  Taylor conceded the first batch was n't very good and the biscuits were crumbly .  They also had to work on the protein content , so they added soya .  " The biscuits turned out to be less crumbly , " Taylor said .  Then Rwandan student Pam Dovi explored the possibility of using cowpeas instead of soya . " This was the technical breakthrough , " said Taylor .  The biscuits were tested in Mamelodi , where people evaluated the biscuits in terms of taste , appearance and texture .  The biscuits were compared with conventional commercial biscuits , for example shortbread .  " People found the biscuit very acceptable , " Taylor said .  The biscuits were also evaluated in terms of their ability to generate an income .  Taylor and his team determined one could earn the equivalent of a domestic worker 's salary the university and the University of Limpopo started training people to make the biscuits .  This is part of a bigger agricultural project sponsored by the Howard G Buffet Foundation through the Norman Borlaug Institute .  Nokuthula Vilakati , a PhD candidate in nutrition , focuses on educating people about the nutritional value of the biscuits and sorghum .  Since March , 11 people have been trained , but Taylor wants to see this project develop into something bigger .  The team have developed a step-by-step manual with pictures explaining how to make the biscuits .  Nosihle Dladla , a Master 's degree student , said the biscuits had " a lot of potential throughout Africa " and because children were curious , they would try the biscuits . As part of her research she is developing other sorghum snacks such as chips .  PhD candidate Adeoluwa Adetunji from Nigeria is developing sorghum beverages , similar to the fermented , non-alcoholic drink known as mageu or amahewu .  Taylor believes the biscuit " offers the best of both worlds " by combining traditional grains  " By 2030 , half of Africans will live in cities and this will profoundly change the way people eat , " he said .  Instead of half a loaf of bread and a soft drink , people could enjoy a biscuit that added value to their diet . Three biscuits made with sorghum and soya would provide a child with 50 percent of its daily high quality protein requirements .  RECIPE  Sorghum and cowpeas biscuits ( makes 20 15g biscuits )  1 ? cup finely milled sorghum flour  ? cup finely milled cowpeas flour  ? cup sugar  2 teaspoons baking powder  ? cup sunflower oil  2 teaspoons vanilla essence  100ml water .  Method :  Turn on the oven to 190 ? C.  Combine the sorghum and cowpea flour in a mixing bowl .  Add the sugar and baking powder .  Add the sunflower oil and vanilla essence .  Add the water .  Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon and shape the dough into a ball by hand .  Sprinkle a baking with a rolling pin .  Press the dough flat on the baking tray ( as thick as a biscuit ) and cut it into the desired shapes .
