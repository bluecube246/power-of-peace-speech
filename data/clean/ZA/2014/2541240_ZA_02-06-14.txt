<h> Tags : <p> Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) Secretary General , Zwelinzima Vavi says the National Development Plan can not address the high levels of unemployment and inequality facing the country . <p> In an interview with SABC News , Vavi says the envisioned radical transformation of the economy can not be realised through the NDP economic policy . During his inauguration last week , President Jacob Zuma vowed that in his new term government will implement radical economic transformation <p> Vavi says Cosatu 's concerns regarding the National Development Plan are yet to be addressed . Vavi and Cosatu 's largest affiliate , Numsa , have been vocal in criticism of the plan which is seen as the government 's blueprint for the next 30 years . <p> Vavi says he does n't believe that radical economic transformation can be realised through the NDP . <p> " You can never succeed in attacking and breaking the backbone of an unemployment rate that has reached catastrophic levels at 35.1% as we speak , using neo-liberal programmes such as the NDP or GEAR for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have made South Africa to be ranked No.1 in the whole world , in the country with most inequalities . And you can never succeed to lift that 23 to 26 million South Africans who are living below the poverty line or on one-US-dollar a day if you are using neo-liberal programmes . " <p> Vavi says the NDP is flawed and the federation will continue to raise its shortcomings . " Cosatu will continue to say we can not rely on a programme clearly , that follows the foot paths of the disastrous 20 years that have led to an economy that regenerates , reproduces unemployment , poverty and inequality . We need a change of that NDP all together . " <p> Vavi believes radical economic transformation should include nationalisation of mines <p> The plan was adopted at the ANC 's Mangaung elective conference . Vavi says one can not talk about radical economic transformation and NDP at the same time . <p> ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says various stakeholders were given a chance to give their inputs . He emphasizes that the programme is a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ANC which is a product of various consultations endorsed by different sectors . It 's not only Cosatu , there are individuals in society who have issues with the NDP . As we implement sections of the NDP , we ca n't wait until we have a perfect document that everybody is happy about . In the process of implementing the NDP , its people will be allowed because it 's a living document , it 's not a concept . We 're ... in the process of implementation - they will make contribution , we 'll make amendments when necessary , but we ca n't wait until we find this perfect document , which it will never become . We 'll perfect the document as we implement it . " <p> Vavi believes radical economic transformation should include nationalisation of mines . At the Mangaung conference , the ANC fell short of nationalization of mines , but instead adopted a policy of great state intervention in key areas of the economy .
