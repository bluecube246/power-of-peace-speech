x factor need for gospel top 15  another season of i want to sing gospel is upon us and more of the genre 's enthusiasts have come out to try to take the crown . the audition numbers are much larger than before , but the producers are keeping the selected singers to a minimum .  auditions were held in east london , durban and joburg and only five people from each city were chosen . now out of the audition phase , we go straight into the top 15 to determine who will be whittled down to find the winner .  several changes have been made to the show , from the judging panel to the host . thabo mdluli , who hosted the previous seasons , is working on idols sa as a vocal coach and furthering his musical interests so he will not return to the presenter 's seat .  in his place will be actress , salamina mosese .  the judging panel boats a revamp -- lindelani mkhize now takes on the role of talent scout , leaving producer sipho makhabane and well known scout , tshepo ndzimande .  sadly , the winner gets to walk away with a mere r200 000 which is a far cry from what other shows of this nature provide . at least there is also a recording contract to help the winner get a foot in the gospel industry .  we caught up with the talented singer and songwriter , mbambo . she fostered her talents in joyous celebration but now flies solo .  mbambo is no randall abrahams , yet her new job requires her to deliver harsh truths to some of the contestants .  " honestly , it is going to be hard for me to break people 's hearts like that , " she said .  " at first i told the producers i was not sure i wanted to do this because it is hard for me to demoralise someone on tv about a talent which they feel they have . it is not nice , but the bottom line is as much as a few dreams will be broken , there is that on that one .  " my energies will be on finding that person who will grab i want to sing gospel with both hands and take it to greater heights , " she explained .  as a singer with multiple nominations for various awards , mbambo knows exactly what kind of talent is required in a contestant to make the cut .  " i am looking for someone with something special . there are some things you ca n't pinpoint , but there is always that spark about someone ; something you ca n't explain .  " we are looking for that exceptional person with incredible talent , with the character to back it up . they also have to have the anointing for this show because that is necessary for any gospel singer , " she said .  while looking for a winner , other shows take into consideration talent , personality and looks , but mbambo explained that i want to sing gospel will not be looking at people 's appearances .  " you do get the pretty ones , but sometimes you let them go . we are looking for someone with incredible singing talent and if you are also good-looking , that 's great , but that 's not our main focus , " she said .
