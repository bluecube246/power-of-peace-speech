Franschhoek Appellation Grand Prestige certification 2014  The inaugural announcement of wines qualifying for Franschhoek Appellation Grand Prestige status were announced earlier today at Foliage Restaurant .  As Winemag.co.za editor , I performed the role of master of ceremonies . Here is my opening address :  What is Appellation Grand Prestige ? It 's a special designation for Franschhoek 's best wines -- in an over-traded market , any way of differentiating yourself from the competition and motivating the consumer to buy must be a good thing .  AGP seeks to recognise not just quality but " regional typicity " , the focus on three varieties namely Chardonnay , Semillon and Cabernet Sauvignon , these being what have performed best historically .  AGP is premised on the notion that wines should taste of the place where the grapes grow . South Africa 's Wine of Origin scheme came about in the early 1970s and was based on the classification systems of Europe . While some of it is compromised ( Tulbagh included under Coastal Region , for instance ) there are parts of .  But punters are n't going to care unless producers put in the effort to make them care -- somebody recently commented that the AGP is derivative of Swartland Independent and I would say : Precisely . We need to invest meaning in the different appellations .  It 's important to be proactive . I used to joke that you went to Franschhoek for the restaurants and to Stellenbosch for the wine . And then Stellenbosch went and got a whole bunch of decent restaurants ...  What AGP does is compel critics and punters to engage with the wines . There 's stuff that I 've previously tended to overlook that really impresses me . In particular , I ca n't praise the district 's Semillon highly enough .  AGP is also useful in that it makes Franschhoek distinct -- for too long wineries from outside the ward have traded off its fahsionability . Chassagne-Montrachet is n't Puligny-Montrachet and Simondium should realise it is n't Franschhoek ...  AGP is ultimately a celebration of terroir . It 's an important concept but to be honest , I tasting of the world 's best Cabernets , who 's going to be able to tell Franschhoek from Stellenbosch from Bordeaux from Napa with absolute certainty ?  For me , terroir definitely has a metaphysical component and what I think is great about today is that it celebrates not just wine but Franschhoek craftsmanship in general . The trophies that winemakers with AGP certified wines will shortly be receiving are from Franschhoek oak by local woodworker Stuart Douglas and then there are chef Chris Erasmus 's canap ? s ...  The initiative was started by Haut Espoir 's Rob Armstrong , Stony Brook 's Craig McNaught and M ? reson 's Clayton Reabow . All bar a few wineries have bought in -- it 's inevitable that some will want to see proof of concept before committing but they will hopefully come around sooner rather than later ( I 'm talking about you , Boekenhoutskloof and Grand Provance ) .  Many thanks to Cork Supply SA , GV Tec and Anglo African Finace as sponsors -- the reality is that initiatives like this do n't happen without some acknowledgement of the first wines to carry AGP certification . There were 55 wines submitted and judging was done by a panel of 14 Franschhoek winemakers and wine industry personalities . As Clayton Reabow put it , " we wanted to decide our own fate " .  Special mention must be made of the following examples of Chardonnay :  Chamonix 2013  Dieue Donn ? 2013  Glenwood Grand Duc 2011  La Motte 2011  Maison 2012  M ? reson Mercator 2012  M ? reson Dr Reason Why Unwooded 2013  And then of the following examples of Semillon :  La Chataigne 2012  Landau du Val 2013  My Wyn 2012  Rickety Bridge 2012  And of the following Cab :  Lynx 2012  There are ten wines to carry the AGP designation for the first time and these consist of four examples of Chardonnay , three Semillon , two Cabernet Sauvignon and one white blend .
