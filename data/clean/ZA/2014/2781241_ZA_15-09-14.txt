5 of the best South African indie games from A MAZE
http://www.htxt.co.za/2014/09/15/5-of-the-best-south-african-indie-games-currently-being-made/

<p> The event included game demos , workshops , talks by games industry people and a chance for the public to discover the joys of PS3 Move jousting . And dancing . Lots of dancing . ( And a particularly spectacular five minute presentation by the dashing and intelligent editor of a certain website which shall , for the purposes of modesty , remain unmentioned -- Ed ) . <p> Among the games on show were these five that left an impression on me for one reason or another . None of them are finished , and are in fact works in progress by both students and commercial game developers , but they provide an inkling of what 's happening locally . All of the games on show were spectacular , and we 'll be following up with others ( like RetroFuture 's zx-HyperBlast ) at a later date . <h> Flux <p> By Tiane Erwee <p> This simple game by second year WITS Game Design student Tiane Erwee is all about the design , not the graphics , and boy does she nail it . Flux is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguise a very tricky puzzle game , where players have to navigate a visual maze to collect orbs by moving , jumping , changing orientation and switching gravity . It requires a quick mind and fast reflexes , as any mis-step resets the whole thing . There are definitely very good things in this young designer 's future . <p> I was amazed by this very clever musical puzzle game that required players to connect up various nodes , each with their own function , in such a way that a looping tune is completed . It increased in complexity the more I played , until eventually I was faced with a mind-boggling array of options and multiple paths to solution . I was even more surprised when the developers , who are making the game for commercial release , told me that there is even a visual composer element to the game that lets people write their own music . So clever . <p> Advert <h> Parallax <p> By Liam Brookshank <p> Another student game , Parallax features a tiny block that must navigate levels by pulling off some pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , controls . The challenge is steep , requiring players to stick to walls while simultaneously jumping and shooting to create momentum , and success is a massive juggling act in terms of brain power , manual dexterity and , sometimes , blind luck . Think " as hard as Dark Souls " but with incredibly minimalistic graphics . <h> Metamorforest <p> By Benjamin Crooks <p> Metamorforest is a rather abstract **26;1055;TOOLONG simulator that does n't give you a lot to do but walk and survive . If you 're lucky , you 'll come across a piece of wood to burn once the sun goes down to keep the noisy animals/creatures that snuffle around in the background at bay , so you can survive to walk another day . If you 're not ... well ... you 're but a smear on the landscape in the morning . You can also hunt the occasional animal for food and even meet other lost souls who you can decide to team up with ... or not . Teaming up worked out for me as my companion was eaten instead of me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next night , of course , for a grand total of 3 days survived . Go me ! <p> I was a little disappointed to find that the action role-playing game Tom Sparks and the Quakes of Ruin had attempted a Kickstarter campaign and failed . It was on show at A MAZE , and it looked really decent with its cute graphics , jump pads and wide range of weapons with which to break stuff . Sure , it looks a bit like Torchlight , but it 's very clearly NOT Torchlight as well , which makes its Kickstarter failure all the more of a pity .
