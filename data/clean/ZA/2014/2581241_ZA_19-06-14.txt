<p> Ubisoft is looking to shake up the racing genre with their impressive addition -- The Crew . It 's all vroom vroom and loads of fun . I got some hands on time with the game , and this could just be the racing game for me . <p> The Crew takes a more RPG approach to racing . Sure , the cars are relatively realistic , but it 's more about the fun -- the tracks , the adventure , and challenging your friends . <p> First of all , there 's the environment . The developers made a huge effort to replicate the entire US of A. Not just the cities , not just random stretches of highway , but to give players the opportunity to race across the country , go off-roading and experience a variety of experiences . <p> Using that , you can team up with your crew and go racing -- not just on a specific track , but using all kinds of weird and wonderful combination . How about racing sports cars from New York to LA ? Or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bayou ? Or maybe you can just jump into some drag racers and speed down Route 66 . Whatever you want to do , The Crew has unique experiences on offer . <p> Speaking to the creative director , Julian Gerighty , he explained that he loves playing with his friends , but is also a father . As a result , his prime gaming time is 6:30 in the morning . Of course , none of his friends are awake then , or willing to play games . As such , they built-in a challenge system into The Crew -- do your race and then challenge a friend . Your race , including your car , route and times will then be saved as a ghost . When your friend is ready , they can take on the challenge and race you -- results will be delivered to both of you once completed . I think this is a fantastic option -- people are n't always able to coordinate schedules and this means that you can still race against your friends . <p> The racing itself is lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeys , and there are a variety of missions . The first part of the demo was actually a take down race -- my team had to gun it to catch up to an enemy vehicle , and then we had to force it off the road or ram into it so that it took damage and eventually we won . It was an odd race , but a quite cool with the team . <p> Next up was a more standard race , but still team-based . Our crew of four had to race against another crew of four . I apologized in advance because I am such a horrible driver in games , but it was still nice to explore the tracks and go as fast as I could . <p> Beyond racing , you can also fully customize and level up your vehicles , adding performance enhancements as well as visual customizations . I had a fantastic time changing my rims and paint job -- it felt like an old school episode of pimp my ride . <p> Despite the fact that I 'm not normally a racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made a very fun entry into the racing genre . If you are keen for a game that 's all about riding around with your friends , you really ca n't beat The Crew . <h> Share this : <h> In this article <p> Wielding my lasso of truth , I am the combination of nerd passion and grammar nazi . I delve into all things awesome and geek-tastic . I believe people should stop defining themselves and just enjoy playing games , so let 's get on with it !
