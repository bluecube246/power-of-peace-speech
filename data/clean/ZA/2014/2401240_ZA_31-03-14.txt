production cars thrill at killarney  cape town - despite lengthy delays due to oil on the circuit after almost every race , round two of the sa super series at killarney delivered exciting , close and occasionally very robust racing from each of the national classes - none more so than the production class races .  reigning champion michael stephen ( audi s4 ) made the best of his pole-position to lead the sprint race from lights to flag , chased all the way by local hero johan fourie in a plain white bmw 335i , who found himself the bmw meat in an audi sandwich when he was challenged by series rookie gennaro bonafede , forcing him to defend second while poking hiss nose up alongside stephen under braking as often as he thought he could get away with it .  veteran hennie groenewald - who had to start from the back of the grid - closed up to bonafede in the final stages but could n't get close enough to challenge his young team-mate , and had to settle for fifth , class a new boy simon moss ( audi s4 ) for fifth .  class t  the ' hairdryer class ' was something of a survival test as ryan rhode kept the mini tradition of munching gearboxes alive and gary formato ( ford focus st ) pulled out after just one lap with a virulent misfire .  while the minis last , however , they are very quick indeed ; after some very robust curt and thrust in the early stages lee thompson moved clear , assisted by a difference of opinion between the vw golf gti of class champion graeme nathan and young gun michael van rooyen 's chevrolet cruze , who then dropped back to a less bruising third in class .  they were trailed home by the surviving focus of shaun duminy and the privateer golf gti of charl smalberger .  feature race  the customary reversed grid put cronje on pole and took advantage of it with a blistering start ( literally - we could smell the rubber four storeys up in the commentary box ) that put him straight into the lead midway through the 14 laps , however , fourie had moved up to second ; for a while it seemed the local man would challenge for the lead , but he never got quite close enough and the closing stages became a contest between the audis to decide third .  not surprisingly it was stephen , the acknowledged master of the reverse grid , who showed the fellowship of the four rings the way home , ahead of bonafede and groenewald .  by lap five thompson had carved his way through from the back of the field to lead the class , despite a couple of heart-stopping moments when the mini seemed to lose momentum .  formato , meanwhile , discovered early on that his crew had not succeeded in curing his st 's misfire and he retired after a handful of laps .  a decent start had put duminy in a second position he was unwilling to give up to a clearly quicker nathan and van rooyen ; for the next five laps he drove the world 's widest focus st , frustrating nathan 's every right up .  classic  when nathan finally outbraked him into turn 1 , duminy immediately hit back with a kamikaze inside move in turn 2 that became a classic t-bone .  miraculously the gti survived without chassis damage but the impact broke off both the hinges on the ford 's driver 's door . for the rest of the race it was held in place only by the latch at the back , gaping open like an airbrake and threatening to fly off at any second .  unsurprisingly , duminy dropped way back to come home fifth in class ; even after van rooyen picked up a front-wheel puncture he was able to stay ahead of the focus for fourth behind thompson , nathan and charl smalberger , in the only class t car to stay out of trouble for the whole 14 laps .  and even the the drama was n't over , as thompson 's mini was excluded after the race for being underweight , promoting nathan to the win , with a surprised and delighted smalberger and van roooyen rounding out the podium 1 , daniel rowe , set the pace im practice and qualifying - but the draw was n't kind to him and he wound up fifth on the grid for both races .  a scrappy first few laps however , soon saw him challenging dewald brummer , who 'd come up from the fifth row of the grid , for the lead - until juan brummer hit the tyre wall and put his polo on its roof , perilously close to the circuit .  but before that safety car could get out on the circuit , mathew hodges and eddie rodriques had a clash of will that left rodriques at the side of the road in a polo that was n't going anywhere for a long time , if ever .  by the time the marshals had cleared the debris , the field was closely bunched behind the safety car and there were only two laps in it - a flat-out sprint for the line that saw brummer take the flag ahead of rowe .  race 2  both the ladies in the polo series - cape qualified in the top six and lady luck showed them some sisterly solidarity in the draw for the second race with pole position for pepper and third for bate .  it was pepper 's first pole in the series and she made the most of it by scorching away to an early lead while 14-year-old driving prodigy sheldon van der linde dealt with a determined challenge from jano van der westhuizen and rowe - determined enough that at least one door mirror was seen flying up out of the melee under braking for turn 5 .  driver of the day  in the closing stages however , van der linde broke the tow and reeled in the race leader , forcing her to work very hard indeed for her second win in vw cup racing , just ahead of van der linde and rowe .  second in race 1 and third in race 2 was enough to secure the overall win for the day for rowe , and keep him at the top of the championship standings , while a solid ninth for the day on only his killarney earned series rookie michael gibson driver of the day .  trevor bland took the win in the masters class for drivers over 28 , from hodges and shaun holtzhauzen ; hodges retain the lead in the class standings but with the gap sufficiently narrowed to make the masters category highly unpredictable .  no race info was available for the combined v8 supercars at the time of publishing .
