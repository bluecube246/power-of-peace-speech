Government throws Eskom a lifeline

<p> The state has thrown a promised lifeline to struggling power utility Eskom , announcing a bail-out package aimed at plugging its R225-billion funding gap and helping it get back to financial sustainability . <p> Experts have already warned however that the plan -- which includes unspecified additional funding -- raises the risk of further credit rating downgrades for the government . <p> The rescue plan comes as Eskom continues to face serious operational challenges , heightening the risk of more load shedding for consumers . <p> On Sunday , the national treasury announced in a statement that the plan was aimed at helping to " relieve the impact on electricity consumers , as well as add additional support to Eskom 's balance sheet " . <p> It will include government support for regulatory tariff adjustments and further funding for the state-owned supplier , with the amount to be announced at October 's medium-term budget policy statement . <p> The equity injection will come from " leveraging non-strategic government assets " -- suggesting possible privatisation -- with further detail to be revealed at the budget announcement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above the R200-billion earmarked for the current tariff cycle . " While higher debt levels do have a negative impact on Eskom 's balance sheet , it is necessary to reduce the immediate impact on electricity consumers , " said the statement . <p> Eskom has existing government guarantees of R350-billion , of which it has only drawn R122-billion . The treasury said the guarantees will be used to reduce Eskom 's debt costs but stressed it needed to manage costs and raise sufficient revenue to cover these . <p> ' Negative for balance sheet'Other elements of the package include accelerating electricity demand management measures that do not undermine economic growth ; supporting the growth of independent power producers and a drive to improve operational efficiency . <p> " Eskom will need to improve the efficiency of its operations through more effective maintenance of existing power stations , limiting cost over-runs in the new build programme , improving procurement outcomes and management of working capital , " the treasury said . <p> Razia Khan , head for Africa macro research at Standard Chartered , said it was " something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary support " . <p> While details of the equity injection were still to be clarified , the mention of leveraging non-strategic asset did hint at " potential privatisation of some state assets , " she said in a research note . <p> Ratings agencies would likely view the plan as a " negative for the balance sheet of the South African government , " Khan said . <p> " With South Africa 's rating already threatened by its weak growth outlook , and an almost-across-the-board deterioration in a number of credit metrics , the decision of cabinet to approve an equity injection for Eskom -- although expected -- adds to potential downgrade pressure . " <p> Eskom 's funding gap is partly driven by the company not generating enough revenue to cover the cost of supplying electricity , says the treasury . <p> It is currently building two mega coal power stations in a bid to boost capacity and avoid widespread blackouts . One of the plants , Medupi , was supposed to have come online by the end of last year but is running behind schedule as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as acute as its financial ones and the utility has reversed its previous policy of keeping the lights on at the expense of maintenance , heightening the risk of load shedding for consumers . <p> Over two fifths of Eskom 's power generating plants are in disrepair and urgently need maintenance to bring it back to adequate performance levels . <p> Of Eskom 's 87 coal-fired generation units -- six are typically located at each power station -- 36 are in urgent need of maintenance , according to Eskom spokesperson Andrew Etzinger . <p> The backlog will take at least two years to eliminate he said in an interview last week . In addition , it would take " a significant amount of capacity " from both the uncompleted Medupi and Kusile power stations , before the country had an adequate electricity reserve margin . <p> The previous strategy of deferring refurbishment in a bid to keep the lights on had caused a downward spiral , said Etzinger . " What was realised was , it 's not sustainable , " he said . <p> The deterioration has seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Eskom 's fleet . <p> Chris Yelland , managing director of EE Publishers and Eskom expert , said despite energy consumption being at a seven year low availability had dropped even faster . <p> Even if Medupi were to come online all at once , it would be outweighed by the drop in energy availability , he said . <p> This was a consequence of Eskom 's previous decision to keep the lights on at the cost of maintenance , said Yelland . <p> Load sheddingEtzinger denied political pressure ahead of the elections was the reason why Eskom had opted to pursue keeping the lights on at all costs . <p> However , for the first time this financial year load shedding had been taken out of Eksom 's shareholder compact with the department of public enterprises , its shareholder . This reflected " an understanding of all stakeholders , including our shareholder , that keeping the lights on at all costs is just not sustainable " , he said . <p> As part of its new philosophy , Eskom has returned decentralised decision making to its power station managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head office , Megawatt Park in Johannesburg , before taking a unit out of service . <p> This is designed to return authority and accountability to power station managers and is in keeping with the drive to secure the health of its fleet in the long run . <p> Industry speculation , however , suggests that the level of degradation of Eskom 's fleet has become widespread and severe , and is compounded by an attrition of skills at power stations . <p> Etzinger said the utility was finding that when routine maintenance on generation units was done , it often sees " scope creep " . In other words , the repair work that is needed , is often more than is initially expected or planned for . <p> Eskom did not have a " significant skills issue " he noted but it was working to make better use of the skills it already had . <p> He stressed these problems did not necessarily translate into load shedding which was also influenced by demand , planned maintenance and trips at power stations . The difference now was that Eskom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unplanned outages in the system .
