At least as well as they could , " Abrams explained . " You do hear a little bit of Yoda . You hear Luke yelling out , ' Nooo ! ' from that moment in Empire . And you hear Obi-Wan at the end say , ' Rey ... these are your first steps . ' ' " <p> Interestingly enough , while McGregor recorded that Obi-Wan line specifically for The Force Awakens , the first word , when Obi-Wan says the name " Rey , " was actually pulled from a prior line by Guinness from the original Star Wars trilogy . In order to get the snippet , they edited a line of Guinness ' that included the word " Afraid , " Abrams revealed . <p> Abrams said that when Force Awakens producer Bryan Burk first played him Obi-Wan saying " Rey , " he thought it was McGregor initially and was thrilled when he was told it was Guinness , telling EW , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- he 's saying it the way I would have begged Alec Guinness to have said it . It is so crazy perfect . " <p> The director also shared what he thought was the " cool part " of the process in working with Obi-Wan actor McGregor , saying , " He was awesome ... incredibly sweet and handsome , and all that stuff . Then he rode off on his motorcycle . Literally the coolest voice over actor ever . " <p> While Yoda voice actor and puppeteer Frank Oz also traveled to Bad Robot to record new lines for The Force Awakens , Abrams said the studio ended up using pre-existing content instead . " He was very generous to say , ' Whatever makes the movie better , I 'm happy to help out , ' " Abrams said .
