Independent human rights organisation Lawyers for Human Rights ( LHR ) has launched an urgent application in South Africa 's North West High Court , asking Pilanesberg Platinum Mines to cease all mining activities with immediate effect and restore possession of the Wilgerspruit farm .  The matter will be heard in the court on the 3rd of September .  Represented by LHR , the Lesethleng Village Community is seeking full possession , occupation and use of the farm which it has owned , farmed and developed for over a hundred years .  Without obtaining consent from the community , the lawyers allege that the company has sought to constructively evict the community by continuing its mining activities on the land without agreement from the community .  This , they allege , has been done by restricting access to water in addition to de-bushing at least 41% of the surface area of the farm , hindering farming activity .  LHR land and housing programme head Louise du Plessis said : " The farm is a major source of income and livelihood for the of the land flies in the face of South Africa 's constitutional obligations .  " It can not be that a community 's rightful and legal ownership can be so blatantly ignored . "  " It can not be that a community 's rightful and legal ownership can be so blatantly ignored . "  The community was informed in 2008 that Bakgatla-ba-Kgafela tribal authority had acquired mining rights to Wilgerspruit .  Due to fencing off parts of the farm and removing vegetation in preparation for mining , the water piping system was completely destroyed and the community was left without any access to water for themselves and their livestock .  On 28 October 2014 , LHR issued a letter of demand that the mine cease its activities .  The demand was agreed for a short while , however , on 22 March , the mine resumed its activities , LHR said .
