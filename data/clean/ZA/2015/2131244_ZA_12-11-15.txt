Israel 's cloistered but politically powerful ultra-Orthodox community has for decades maintained a separate education system , where boys and girls study holy texts and secular studies take a distant back seat .  Related Links  Valletta - The European Union will hold a special summit with Turkey to secure its co-operation on stemming migration flows , top officials said on Thursday , adding that they are working to come up with ? 3bn in aid demanded by Ankara .  " We feel confident that a mutually beneficial relationship can be established that will help us confront the present migration crisis , " EU President Tusk said after informal talks with the bloc 's leaders in the Maltese capital Valletta .  The EU has been courting Turkey for more than a month in a bid to enlist its help in holding back the migrants and asylum seekers that have been transiting through its territory on their way to Europe .  More than 800 000 people have reached the continent by sea this year and thousands are arriving daily on Greek islands after setting is home to more than 2 million Syrian refugees .  In what critics have decried as a " dirty deal " , Brussels is offering Turkey more aid and closer ties in exchange for help on the refugee crisis . The approach is controversial because of concerns over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's authoritarianism and human rights record .  According to Brussels diplomats , one of Ankara 's demands had been a high-profile summit between Erdogan and the EU 's 28 leaders - an unusual format .  " We are ready to hold a special summit of the 28 member states with Turkey as soon as possible , " Tusk said in Valletta . " I do not have a date yet , but it could still be this year after a new Turkish government has been formed . "  Turkey held elections on November 1 that delivered a victory to Erdogan 's party .  Tusk said he was " 99% sure " that the summit would be held in Brussels at the end of November . The date under consideration is November 29 , Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande both spoke of late November or early December as a time for the summit .  A more tricky demand from Ankara has been the ? 3bn in support to help it host Syrian refugees - three times more than what the cash-strapped EU had initially offered .  But Merkel said that " in principle , the sum has not been challenged " .  " I do n't think this is about political prices . This is about opening a new chapter , " she added .  The European Commission , the bloc 's executive , would be able to provide ? 500m over the next two years , President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Valletta .  He suggested that EU member states should make up the rest , with their contributions based on gross national incomes .  According to a document prepared by the commission for Thursday 's talks and seen by dpa , that would require Germany to provide the largest contribution at ? 534m over the next two years - followed by Britain with ? 410m ,  The proposal is expected to prove unpopular among EU member states , sources said on condition of anonymity .  " It 's a somewhat difficult budgetary issue , but ... I am hopeful that we will manage and that we will be able to conclude our negotiations with Turkey during the special summit , " Juncker said .  The money would be aid for refugees , " not a compensation for Turkey " , Hollande insisted . He said the summit would be used to also hold talks with Erdogan on Turkey 's EU membership bid and easier visas for its citizens - two other areas where Ankara has asked for progress .  The issue of Cyprus is also expected to come up . The island , a member of the EU , is divided into a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 after Turkey invaded the north in response to a Greek-led coup . The situation has long strained relations between Ankara and Nicosia .  Tell us a bit about yourself :  Saving your profile  Settings  News24 allows you location .
