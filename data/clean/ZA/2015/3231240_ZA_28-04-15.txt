a headed goal in optional time by substitute mohau mokate gave maritzburg united a 1-0 absa premiership win over visiting ajax cape town who dominated the scoring opportunities on the night .  the match at harry gwala stadium took a while to get going with no goal mouth situations inside the opening ten minutes and it took until the 14th minute for the first attempt on goal when kurt lentjies ? shot flew across the face of goal .  it took until the 23rd minute for an ajax chance on goal when keagan dolly pounced on lost ball possession to set up abbubakar mobara who fired in a shot , only to see it well saved by a diving shuaib walters  a few minutes later and dolly got in a shot at goal , but it hardly troubled walters before anssi jaakkola was called into action for the visitors , making a comfortable punched clearance from a corner kick .  on the half hour mark toriq losper fashioned a shot at goal but again walters was there to make the save , and see their shots flash wide of goal in a lively opening half by the visiting ajax .  then in the 42nd minute ajax should have taken the lead when cale fired in a cross to the back post where an unmarked mosa lebusa somehow headed wide of the goal .  directly after the interval ajax were in with a shout again when dolly got into a one-on-one situation but his effort was saved by the impressive walters .  maritzburg coach steve komphela made all of his substitutions by the 67th minute , a clear indication of his unhappiness with the way his side had played up then .  mondli cele could not do anything to help ease his coach ? s concerns when he put an effort wide in the 64th minute before ryan de jongh ? s effort also lacked power and direction .  ajax thought they had done enough for a winner in the 83rd minute only to see maritzburg goalkeeper walters tip a lebusa header onto the upright to keep the score goalless .  then , despite being dominated by ajax for substitute mokate finished off with a header from deolin mekoa ? s supply in referee ? s optional time .
