fashion blogger and student , jessica van wyk , shows you how to wear and find the perfect poncho .  related links  ever since my first trip to new york back in 2012 , i have been obsessing with ponchos . one morning , while walking on the famed streets , surrounded by never-ending skyscrapers , i saw a woman in brown chelsea boots , faded blue skinny jeans and an aztec poncho .  from that morning it became a mission of mine to find the perfect poncho . recently , while devouring the zara sale -- i finally found it . while it may be three sizes too large for me , i could n't get over the colour and the fabric . plus , i actually prefer larger sizes as they often make for more interesting silhouettes .  if you 've already done the math , you will know that it took me about three years to find this piece of woolen gloriousness . patience was key .  24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere a comment for editorial review , please do so by clicking the ' report comment ' button to the right of each comment .
