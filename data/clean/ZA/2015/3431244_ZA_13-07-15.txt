Fashion blogger and student , Jessica van Wyk , shows you how to wear and find the perfect poncho .  Related Links  Ever since my first trip to New York back in 2012 , I have been obsessing with ponchos . One morning , while walking on the famed streets , surrounded by never-ending skyscrapers , I saw a woman in brown Chelsea boots , faded blue skinny jeans and an Aztec poncho .  From that morning it became a mission of mine to find the perfect poncho . Recently , while devouring the Zara sale -- I finally found it . While it may be three sizes too large for me , I could n't get over the colour and the fabric . Plus , I actually prefer larger sizes as they often make for more interesting silhouettes .  If you 've already done the math , you will know that it took me about three years to find this piece of woolen gloriousness . Patience was key .  24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere a comment for editorial review , please do so by clicking the ' Report Comment ' button to the right of each comment .
