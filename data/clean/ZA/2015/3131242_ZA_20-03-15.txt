<p> The small gardens of agricultural labourers planted in Europe hundreds of years ago created the myth of the cottage garden . <p> Comprised of plantings on either side of a path leading to the front door of the cottage home , the garden was a mix of colourful local plants interspersed with some herbs and vegetables . Lawns were never a feature of cottage gardens . <p> With the movement to provide bees with food , cottage gardening is once again very fashionable . Being surrounded by a forest of colourful flowers is not only the ultimate fantasy of gardening , but is now also bee-friendly and butterfly-friendly . <p> Design considerations <p> The cottage garden is essentially an intimate garden style , ideal for small gardens and townhouses . To achieve the cottage look , keep the lawn size small or remove it . Make the surrounding borders large and plant hundreds of flowering plants . <p> It is possible to include many indigenous plants in a cottage garden ; it is simply a matter of having in mind a clear picture of the end result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daisies , lachenalia , agapanthus , pelargonium and scabiosa . <p> Plan a mixed border <p> To achieve the cottage garden style in mixed borders , aim for the following : <p> * Plant taller shrubs or standards at the back of the border , medium ones in the middle , and shorter ones at the front . However , include some low growing plants that send up tall flowers -- such as foxgloves , iris and dwarf agapanthus -- near the front to avoid too regimented a look . <p> * In small gardens with small borders select plants with a narrow upright growth for the back of the border or use standards . Another alternative is to plant climbers against the walls to achieve height without spread . For shaded walls , the evergreen star jasmine is ideal . <p> * Plant perennials , annuals and bulbs in drifts , not in regular rows or patterns . <p> * To create interest place plants with contrasting foliage shape , foliage colour and leaf texture next to each other , for example , an iris with sword-shaped grey foliage next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * Place plants with different shaped blooms next to each other . Flower shapes can be spire-like ( foxgloves ) , flat ( daisies ) and round ( dahlias and roses ) . <p> Choosing plants <p> * Roses are an integral part of a cottage garden . Plant them in borders , over archways and pergolas , against walls and in narrow borders . English or nostalgia roses as well as floribundas are more relaxed and informal than the hybrid teas . <p> * Annuals and bulbs provide the long-lasting colour that is part and parcel of a cottage garden . Choose what you like from the available range of seasonal seeds , seedlings and bulbs . Make a point of including tall annuals like hollyhocks , foxglove or verbascum . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?
