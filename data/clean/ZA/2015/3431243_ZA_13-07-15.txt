<p> Malajila 's commitment and high-energy performances stand as the first reason why the Ka Bo Yellow nation has warmed up to him in the way that they have done . If you really want a striker that will work " overtime all the time " then ' Mala ' is the man . He simply never gets tired and at times literally has to be told to slow down on the amount of work that goes into his game ! <p> As a coach , even when he is not getting you goals his high work-rate game will push you into keeping him on the field as he never stops putting in the effort . <p> In his time in the PSL , ' Cuthy ' has reaped 34 goals in 94 starts , including his time at Maritzburg United where he spent 18 months . Several defenders have admitted that he is just way too busy a forward to enjoy playing against . <p> At 29 years of age , fans are still expecting to see a lot more than what we have already seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The comments posted do not reflect the views of KickOff.com .
