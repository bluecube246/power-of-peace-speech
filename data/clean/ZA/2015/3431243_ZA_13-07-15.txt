malajila 's commitment and high-energy performances stand as the first reason why the ka bo yellow nation has warmed up to him in the way that they have done . if you really want a striker that will work " overtime all the time " then ' mala ' is the man . he simply never gets tired and at times literally has to be told to slow down on the amount of work that goes into his game !  as a coach , even when he is not getting you goals his high work-rate game will push you into keeping him on the field as he never stops putting in the effort .  in his time in the psl , ' cuthy ' has reaped 34 goals in 94 starts , including his time at maritzburg united where he spent 18 months . several defenders have admitted that he is just way too busy a forward to enjoy playing against .  at 29 years of age , fans are still expecting to see a lot more than what we have already seen from  the comments posted do not reflect the views of kickoff.com . users are reminded that no misuse of this comment facility will be tolerated . any abusive , racist , inflammatory , defamatory , discriminatory comments or hate speech will be deleted and the user banned .  if legally obliged we will hand over your information under the protection of information act .
