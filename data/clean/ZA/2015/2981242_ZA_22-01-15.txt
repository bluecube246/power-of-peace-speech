rental car 's missing fuel mystery  johannesburg - consumer sites like hellopeter are full of complaints against car-rental firms , but while most of the ire concerns poor service , one that has come to our attention is more serious as it involves possible fraud .  reader dave pullen recently hired a vw polo vivo 1.4 from first car rental at o.r . tambo airport and was shocked at the petrol bill he had to pay when returning the car - after giving the car back with what he believed was a full tank of fuel .  according to the rental contract , cars are handed to the renter full of fuel and the renter is responsible for the cost of topping up the tank after they return the car .  pullen has no problem with that , but he suspects some skulduggery because his wife filled the car up to the " first-click " at an airport petrol station just before returning it , and he was dismayed when he subsequently received a bill of r167 for an additional 13 litres for first car rental 's office at o.r tambo and its fuel depot in pomona is just 5km , which could not possibly account for 13 litres of fuel being used .  pullen also worked out , based on the 191 km distance he drove and a total of 23 litres of fuel pumped into the vehicle , that the vivo 1.4 averaged a consumption of over 12 litres per 100km - double the manufacturer 's quoted fuel consumption figure of 6.2 litres/100km .  what 's going on ?  pullen suspects that either he 's being charged for fuel that was n't put into the car , or that operators at the depot are claiming to be filling rental cars but stealing the fuel for themselves .  " if the tank was 13 litres below full , it equates to a tank that is only two-thirds full , " says pullen .  " the only explanations are that the fuel gauge is faulty or has been recalibrated , or their 13 litres never made it into the tank . "  when we put these claims to their vehicles to the brim , and that the vivo that pullen rented may have had a vapour lock preventing it being fully filled when pullen 's wife put petrol in the car .  " we record every fill-up on a pump record sheet , which is checked for accuracy by no less than two admin staff members , as well as our regional admin manager , " says melissa storey , executive head : strategy , development &amp; marketing at first car rental .  " staff cars are not permitted on site so as to prevent an opportunity for fuel theft " .  in this publication 's own experience of road-testing cars it 's uncommon for a vapour lock to create such a large discrepancy ( 13 litres ) , and the difference is normally a couple of litres .  first car rental did n't find the vivo 's 12l/100km consumption to be particularly high , and said that fuel use varies depending on different drivers and road conditions . when this publication road-tested a polo vivo 1.4 it averaged under 8l/100km , however .  balances in our system when it gets captured that calculates impossibilities and therefore possible errors , as well as personnel checks . our customer satisfaction team is satisfied with the investigation into this particular case .
