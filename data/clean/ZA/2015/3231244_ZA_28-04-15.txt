AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha <p> April 28 2015 at 08:59pm <p> Kathmandu - Nepal has told aid agencies it did not need more foreign rescue teams to come and help in the search for earthquake survivors , because its government and military could cope , the national head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search and rescue will go on but the message they wanted us to relay was they have enough to deal with it , " Jamie McGoldrick said . The message was conveyed by the Nepali government and military to aid agencies at a meeting on Tuesday afternoon . <p> If foreign rescue and medical teams are " in the air or just landed , they can come and help " , McGoldrick said . " But if they are on a runway in their home country waiting to take off , then we are telling them not to come . " <p> The government was not immediately available to comment . <p> The fate of thousands of people remains unclear , although four days after a 7.9 magnitude quake wrecked buildings and killed at least 4 600 people , hopes were fading of finding people alive in the rubble . More than 9 200 were injured . <p> Some remote villages believed destroyed by the earthquake had still not been reached , and on Tuesday a local official said up to 250 people were missing after a fresh avalanche . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll could reach 10 000 . <p> " After the first 72 hours the survival rate drops dramatically and we are on day four , " said Wojtek Wilk of the Polish Center for International Aid , a NGO which has six medical staff and 81 firefighters in Nepal . <p> " On the fifth day it 's next to zero . " <p> Rescue teams from around the world were still arriving in the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday . <p> Others have not been able to reach the Himalayan nation as quickly as they had hoped , because its one international airport has been functioning intermittently amid aftershocks . <p> Search and rescue teams " that have not yet arrived in Kathmandu are advised to stand down , " said an advisory on a UN website for emergency coordination . " There is no ... need for teams to arrive . " <p> It also said foreign medical teams that had not yet arrived in Kathmandu should " stand by " . <p> With the search now shifting to more remote areas , there is no need for international teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud or wood , McGoldrick said . <p> A French rescue team was trying to save a male survivor from a residential tower in northern Kathmandu on Tuesday evening . <p> And at Basundhara , also in the north of the capital , rescue teams from the Netherlands , France , Turkey and India , and the Nepal Army , all turned up to search for three survivors thought buried beneath the debris . <p> The 18-strong Dutch Urban Search and Rescue team included paramedics , dog handlers and firemen . After a second sniffer dog failed to pick up the scent of any survivor , the search was called off . <p> " Now there is no hope here , " Huijbrechts Marcel from the Dutch team told Reuters . <p> " When we arrived here yesterday there was absolutely no coordination . There was only a reception where we could register and take permission to set up our base - nothing else , " he said . <p> In the ruined back alleys of Bhaktapur , a badly hit temple city to the southeast of Kathmandu , the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of volunteers from various cities in China . <p> Neither group had received information about how to divide up their search in the city . The Chinese had drones , and the Dutch had dogs , but their joint efforts found no survivors . <p> The Dutch team sought another destination to search , but it said its Nepal Army liaison officer did not know of any possible sites in the Kathmandu Valley . <p> " Why are the army not coordinating ? " asked Niraj Thapa , a Basundhara resident , and the Dutch team 's chief source of on-the-ground information for the day . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?
