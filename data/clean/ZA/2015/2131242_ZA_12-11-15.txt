Opening the African Media Leaders Forum in Boksburg on President Jacob Zuma 's behalf , Radebe stressed the importance of a free press and the media 's role as a watchdog .  " It should play its watchdog role without fear , favour nor prejudice , " Radebe said .  He said the media had to defend the development progress made thus far . It also had to challenge the various stakeholders to act in a manner putting people first and contributing meaningfully towards socioeconomic development .  He said the group coming together at the forum would never have been able to do so under the apartheid regime .  " We owe this freedom and democracy to the militancy of the media practitioners and leaders from across the globe ; the sacrifices of our fellow African brothers in Africa and diaspora and all peoples of the world who said it was common knowledge under apartheid a culture of secrecy , disinformation and restrictions on press freedom was a norm .  According to Radebe , the Promotion of Access to Information Act ( PAIA ) had been used effectively over the years by journalists and others to defend this right .  He said government believed the act opened the doors for the implementation of other rights .  On how the positivity towards press freedom and the looming media appeals tribunal would work in conjunction , Radebe told Netwerk24 the tribunal needed to be seen " in perspective " .  There still needed to be a parliamentary enquiry into the " feasibility and desirability " of such a tribunal .  " I think we should wait for that parliamentary process to unfold before we can ... jump to conclusions .
