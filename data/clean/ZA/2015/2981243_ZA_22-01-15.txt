By Cassidee Moser  A card game featuring exploding cats , goats , magical enchiladas , and back hair has reached over two million dollars in funding on its Kickstarter campaign .  Called Exploding Kittens , it 's a card game borrowing elements of Russian Roulette and UNO in its execution . During the course of play , players take turns drawing from a deck . When an exploding kitten card is drawn , the player who drew it is kicked from the game . Other cards , such as diffusers , attacks , and specials will aid the player in avoiding certain exploding death and can even give them an advantage over other players .  Created by game designers Elan Lee and Shane Small with cartoonist Matthew Inman of The Oatmeal , Exploding Kittens ' original funding goal of $10,000 USD was met in eight minutes , then doubled in about twenty .  Currently , funding sits at $2,153,373 with 29 days left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
