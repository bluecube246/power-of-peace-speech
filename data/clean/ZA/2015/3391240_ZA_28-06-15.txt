"  in contrast to last year 's event , which saw attendees hidden from view on a sports ground near the moses mabhida stadium , this year the lgbti community was louder , prouder , and more visible than ever , on the lawns in front of the amphitheatre .  musicians and djs belted out catchy tunes and whipped the crowd into a froth of excitement as the countdown to the march began .  the energy reached fever pitch as a version of flo rida 's good feeling was belted out , prompting the large crowd to chorus : " sometimes , i get a feeling that i never , never , never had before . "  and then they were off ! the local chapter of the da led the procession in a ( gaily ? ) decorated van , followed by a bakkie draped in what looked like pink latex , atop which , perched a half-naked man wearing feathered angel 's wings .  a massive , 30m-long , rainbow-hued gay flag was next the uk and amsterdam , and others from joburg and cape town . even good old bloem was represented .  comment guidelines  has a comment offended you ? hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the right-hand side . click triangle ( ) and select " flag as inappropriate " . our moderators will take action if need be .  verified email addresses : all users on independent media news sites are now required to have a verified email address before being allowed to comment on articles . you are only required to verify your email address once to have full access to commenting on articles . for more information please read our comment guidelines
