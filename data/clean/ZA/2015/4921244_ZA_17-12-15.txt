CES 2016 : LG Unveils Next Year 's Monitors and Laptops Ahead of CES  LG is really excited about its new monitors .  By Kyree Leary  CES 2016 does n't kick off until January , but LG is showing its hand early to encourage people to come check them out as soon as possible .  The South Korean company will arrive at the event with a range of UltraWide monitors , 4K gaming monitors and its new Ultra PC gram laptop . All of which have been " designed for maximum productivity and entertainment for today 's demanding power users . "  Among its UltraWide showings will be the 34-inch ( 3440 x 1440 ) curved UC98 and flat UM88 , which include LG 's picture quality enhancing IPS display technology , and Thunderbolt 2 connectivity . The UC88 , meanwhile , available in 29- and 34-inch sizes , utilizes AMD 's FreeSync to do away with choppiness and broken frames while gaming .  Also at CES will be a pair of LG 's Ultra HD 4K Monitors , the 27-inch . The latter includes a USB Type C port and , more interestingly , allows users to charge their laptops and transfer data at USB 3.0 speeds using a single power cable .  The last of LG 's products is its 15.6-inch gram laptop , which gets its name from its lightweight of 980 grams . The laptop uses a 6th Gen Intel Core processor and will come with Windows 10 .  Expect to learn more about these products ( specifically their full specs ) come next month , alongside everything else we predict we 'll see at the event . CES 2016 takes place in Las Vegas , NV and runs from January 6-9th .  Kyree is a freelance writer hoping he fits the role well . Follow and talk to him on Twitter @KyreeLeary.
