<h> 6 things to consider when investing in a new franchise brand <p> Standard Bank 's head of small business enterprise , Ethel Nyembe , shares her pick of the top six things to consider before buying into a new franchise business <p> Many entrepreneurs entering the world of franchising often find it challenging to decide whether to go with an established brand or throw their hard-earned savings into a totally new venture . <p> " The dilemma of staying with the tried and trusted or going with something new that seems to offer great opportunities is something many potential franchisees face , " Nyembe says . <p> " However , if you are considering a start-up franchise operation , it is best to spend some time doing research and also asking a few probing questions . " <p> Below are the six points to consider before signing a franchise agreement with a newly launched franchise : <p> It is an opportunity to invest in a new concept and fresh products <p> The concept and products may excite you , but you need to look at both with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who you are targeting with your product , the size of the market ( especially in the area in which you would like a franchise ) , whether the market is sustainable and growing , whether the product will be well-priced enough , and who your competitors would be . <p> If the product is unique , you would be well-advised to do some of your own market research to see how it would be accepted in your area ; ask friends and family for their opinions , and search the web to find out how it fared in other cities/countries . <p> Start-up costs will be lower <p> On the positive side , lower costs mean it will be easier for you to get into business . You will also have an opportunity to build the business and , if you should decide to sell later , you would make significant profit on your investment . <p> Against these positives you must balance several things . These include knowing exactly what your money is going to buy . If the start-up costs are low , check what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signage , decoration and merchandising support , and the levels of stock you will be supplied with . <p> Avoid making any decisions before you have fully answered these questions , otherwise you may face unexpected expenses for things that are not included or are hidden in the franchise contract 's fine print . Remember the business saying that " if something looks too good to be true , it probably is too good to be true " . <p> What the total running costs will be <p> Having decided that the start-up costs are attractive , it is time to dig deeper . Find out all you can about the royalty structure and what freedom you have when sourcing stock . If equipment or stock is supplied by the franchisor , find out how their prices compare to the market price for similar items . <p> Look for the unexpected in the contract . You may find that it is a requirement that premises are refurbished every few years and the franchisee pays the bill . Find out whether you are committing yourself to paying for ' co-operative advertising ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national brand advertising . <p> What support are you being offered ? <p> If you have never owned a business , it is important that your franchisor provides the training and support you require to get the business on a sound footing . Find out if there are training courses offered as part of the package , and check the type and level of support services . For instance , does the franchisor help with setting up proper HR procedures and training for staff ? Do they have consultants ' on standby ' to visit and advise you when you need help ? <p> The location of your outlet and the size of your exclusive territory <p> If the new franchisor is intent on opening as many outlets as they can , you could find another outlet selling the same products opening up in your backyard . You will then have to compete for market share . Get the franchisor to set out the policy on this issue in writing . <p> The franchisor 's business record <p> When a franchisor is selling franchise opportunities , they will present the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have developed . Investigate whether their claims are true . <p> Check whether the franchisor has joined a recognised franchise association and is therefore bound to a code of conduct . If the franchisor has not done this , ask why . <p> " Perhaps the most valuable investigation you can do is to find out where franchisees are already operating stores , " Nyembe says . " Ask these people about their experiences with the franchisor , the support they receive and where problems exist . If you have the time , spend a day or two at different outlets . The strengths and weaknesses of the franchise will then become apparent . "
