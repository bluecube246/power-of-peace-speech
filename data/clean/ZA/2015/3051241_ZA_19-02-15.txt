wachowskis crack the matrix of critics  sibling directors refuse to play it safe when making films in hollywood  it seems as if nothing can come between the wachowskis . when the filmmaker siblings are asked what incites the biggest spats between the duo best known for writing and directing the matrix trilogy , andy and lana wachowski provide a non-verbal response : the brother and sister clasp each other 's hands and tap their contrasting noggins -- lana 's fuchsia-hued dreadlocks , andy 's bald head -- together .  " it 's all just love , " said lana . " is that too good to be believed ? "  the wachowskis are equally unflappable when it comes to criticisms of their work . they 're undaunted by the weak box office for their 2012 time-jumping drama cloud atlas and their hyper 2008 cartoon adaptation speed racer , and they 're impervious to the pessimism swirling around their space opera , jupiter ascending .  " i 've gotten a thicker skin when it comes to internet searches on our art , " ..  jupiter ascending centres on a toilet-scrubbing earthling ( mila kunis ) and her gravity-defying alien bodyguard ( channing tatum ) . the pair become caught up in an epic case of intergalactic sibling rivalry , with eddie redmayne , tuppence middleton and douglas boothand portraying a royal space dynasty with nasty plans for humanity .  " i like things that are different , " said kunis , who plays the titular character , jupiter jones . " you have to do things because you want to do them , not because someone else wants you to . if it fails , it does n't matter . i did it because i wanted to work with the wachowskis . if it does n't do well , i still got to work with great people , and i learnt a lot . "  the result is a mostly straightforward sci-fi romp -- for the wachowskis , anyway -- that recalls space sagas like star wars and dune , as well as last year 's guardians of the galaxy . it also marks the first original , non-adapted film that to the matrix trilogy in 2003 .  " there are directors like john ford and christopher nolan who find a tone and stick with it throughout their careers , " said lana . " we 're not like that . we 're always looking for the range of what we see in life . that creates a tension between us and our audience because they do n't know what to expect . it makes people excited , but it can also make for frustrated consumers . "  the delay of jupiter ascending from a july to february release , as well as a surprise screening at sundance where some audience members walked out , has raised questions whether the film will become a $175 million black hole for warner bros . lana likened the reshuffling of jupiter ascending to the studio 's shifting of gravity in 2013 .  said lana : " many cultural critics who shape awareness for films are obsessed with sequels and derivative material . that kind of environment is hostile to originality . i think warner bros was uncomfortable with that environment . " another sci-fi flick . it 's also an opportunity to stand up for fresh material at a time when studios are keener to greenlight sequels , reboots and adaptations . ( andy called the possibility of returning to the matrix a " particularly repelling idea in these times . " ) it 's another subject where the duo is united .  " the cultural obsession with equating a movie 's success to its box office is incredibly damning to this industry , " said andy . " it 's pushing the industry more and more to making pure product , which is another reason why you constantly have reboots . it 's mcdonald 's . people know what they 're going to sit down and watch . inherently , it 's unhealthy for your brain . "  whatever happens with jupiter ascending , the siblings are deep into work on their next ambitious project : a mind-bending drama about eight mentally and emotionally linked strangers called sense8 .  for that project , the wachowskis wo n't have to worry about box office tallies . sense8 is a streaming a comment offended you ? hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the right-hand side . click triangle ( ) and select " flag as inappropriate " . our moderators will take action if need be .  verified email addresses : all users on independent media news sites are now required to have a verified email address before being allowed to comment on articles . you are only required to verify your email address once to have full access to commenting on articles . for more information please read our comment guidelines
