by greg stobart  0  17 dec 2015 14:00:00  the arsenal manager says the chilean has a " very slight chance " of playing against manchester city next monday after a hamstring injury - but he would be mad to take the gamble  it is a sign of alexis sanchez 's desire to play football that when he clearly pulled his hamstring last month against norwich , the arsenal forward tried to convince arsenal wenger that it was nothing to worry about .  the chilean told his manager that he had been kicked in the back of the leg and would be fine - only for scans to reveal a muscle strain that was expected to keep him out for a month .  so it would be foolish for wenger to even consider listening to alexis as the 26-year-old tries to prove his fitness ahead of monday 's crucial home fixture against manchester city .  alexis returned to chile for two weeks after suffering the injury at carrow road and there was even some acceptance at arsenal that the rest might admission , alexis has been " exhausted " and playing in the " red zone " for much of the season and it has shown in some of his performances , despite scoring nine goals in 20 appearances in all competitions so far this term .  so it would be ridiculous to risk alexis next monday when it is unlikely the ? 35 million man will have fully recovered .  arsenal can not afford for their best goalscorer to have a setback when they have a genuine chance of winning the title for the first time since 2004 .  wenger 's short-termism has caught him out with injuries before and let 's not forget that alexis ' current injury came just days after the arsenal manager had admitted he had a tight hamstring .  arsenal are second in the premier league table , have won their last three matches in all competitions and will be favourites to beat manchester city at the emirates even without alexis .  the most likely outcome is that wenger starts alexis on the substitutes ' bench , just as he did just six days after the chilean had returned for pre-season training .  wenger 's gut feeling on injuries has been wrong far too often over the last few years . he himself needs to think rationally and refuse to gamble on alexis ' fitness .
