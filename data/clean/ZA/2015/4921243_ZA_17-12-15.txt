"  It 's a claim the real-life doctor portrayed by Smith , forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu , has himself made for years , giving a detailed description about how he came to name that disease " chronic traumatic encephalopathy . "  But Omalu neither discovered the disease nor named it , according to scientific journals and brain researchers who were interviewed by The Associated Press . And though no one doubts that Omalu 's diagnosis of Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster was pivotal in understanding the dangers of football , fellow researchers and a medical ethicist say Omalu goes too far when  " It 's just not true , and I think he knows that , " said William Stewart , a neuropathologist at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow , Scotland .  " Chronic traumatic encephalopathy has been around for decades . It 's not a new term , " Stewart said . " The only thing I would say that Bennet has done is that he identified it in an American footballer . "  Omalu did not respond to an email or telephone message seeking clarification of his claims . Sony Pictures , which is releasing the film on Christmas Day , issued a statement on Thursday that did not address the conflicts between his public statements and the medical literature .  " Football 's head injury crisis continues to rage with competing interests and agendas , so it is not surprising that there are those that are still trying to undermine Dr. Omalu 's work , " Sony Pictures spokeswoman Jean Guerin said . " What is beyond dispute is that Dr. Omalu 's discovery shined a light on a reality that the NFL ignored for "  With its marquee star and holiday release , " Concussion " is certain to revive that debate . Dozens of former football players have been posthumously diagnosed with CTE after descending into lives of depression , alcohol or drug abuse , violent behavior and even suicide .  Also beyond dispute is the personal struggle Omalu went through after the NFL sought to discredit his research rather than confront the threat to long-term health of its players .  But the new complaints about Omalu are not from the league and its supporters , they come from fellow researchers who say he is claiming credit that should properly go to others . While they are willing to write off scenes in the movie as Hollywood flair -- in one , Omalu is explicitly encouraged by another pathologist to name the disease -- his own statements show it is not just an issue with the script .  In a 2013 talk that is viewable on YouTube , Omalu claims he came up with the name CTE after discovering the disease in Webster 's brain : " I said to You need to give it a sexy name . You need to give it a name that has a good acronym that people will remember , even a 3-year-old kid would remember . That is how ' CTE ' came about . "  In the PBS documentary " League of Denial , " Omalu also claims credit for discovering and naming the disease .  " Name it a disease ; give it a name . Present it as a disease ; package it , " he said , explaining that he had taken a class in business school where they discussed how to create brand equity . " ' Chronic ' means long-term . ' Traumatic ' means it 's associated with trauma . ' Encephalopathy ' means a bad brain . So I had both ends covered . "  At the time of Webster 's autopsy , though , the disease had been known -- and known by that name -- for decades .  Originally studied in boxers in the 1920s as dementia pugilistica , the seminal work on the disease came from British neurologist Macdonald " Punch-drunk syndromes : the chronic traumatic encephalopathy of boxers . "  By Webster 's death on Sept. 24 , 2002 , the disease had been diagnosed not just in boxers but in rugby and soccer players , epileptics and others with illnesses that resulted in head-banging , and an alcoholic circus clown who was knocked unconscious a dozen times as the subject of a dwarf-tossing routine .  " ( Omalu ) must know that this pathology existed for many decades before , " Stewart said . " Otherwise he would n't know what to be looking for . "  Some researchers in the field were hesitant to publicly criticise a colleague . Arthur Caplan , the director of medical ethics at the NYU school of medicine , said exaggerating one 's contributions is " troubled , " but not enough to disqualify the underlying research .  " It would be unethical not to acknowledge the work that came before . It 's certainly un-collegial , " Caplan said . " If you 're building on the work of others , you have to credit them . certainly say , ' I took the ball further down the field . ' But you certainly do n't say , ' There 's nothing , and then I appeared . ' "  What 's not in dispute is that the Webster autopsy and the ensuing attention Omalu 's diagnosis received did in fact serve as the catalyst for doctors , sports officials and media to begin treating concussions as a serious health risk .  Most sports leagues from the NFL to youth soccer now have concussion protocols that had never been contemplated before Omalu -- and , to be sure , other brain researchers -- began publicising the often devastating tales of life with the battery of symptoms generally known as post-concussion syndrome .  " That 's when it started taking traction , when it was noted in professional football players , " said Barry Jordan , the chief medical officer for the New York State Athletic Commission and an Associate Professor of Clinical Neurology at Cornell 's Weill Medical College . " That in and of itself was monumental . "  And that 's why a reprieve from any dents in Omalu 's reputation .  " I think it 's more an internal , ethical issue for scientific research . It is n't that anything 's wrong or falsified , " he said . " All it shows is that the NFL potentially had more reason to be concerned about this because there was research in the literature before he showed up . "
