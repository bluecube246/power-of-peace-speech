And the very worst airline in the world is ...  Cape Town - For the fourth year in a row , North Korea 's Air Koryo was named the very worst airline in the world by Skytrax , a UK-based aviation consultancy providing rankings and reviews for airlines and airports .  Daily Mail reports that Air Koryo came last in a list of 600 carriers , receiving only a one-star rating . Airlines are ranked according to various criteria , including aircraft age and efficiency , in-flight meals and service .  Air Koryo was banned from entering EU airspace in 2006 , due to safety and maintenance concerns . In the meantime , the ban has been lifted on a small part of its fleet , which consists of TU-204 aircraft .  What makes Air Koryo 's poor performance stand out even more is the fact that most of the airlines who top the list are all based in the far East , providing a stark contrast to North Korea .  Despite the bad rating , many readers came out in defense it , with some saying that they had seen a lot worse . This is what a few readers had to say :  Petri Van Zyl - North Korea 's fleet is old and lack the comfort of modern planes . That is purely a result of their politics and economics . That does not say that the planes are not safe to fly in and that the airline is not professional . Everything was on standard at the time the plane was built and all planes used to look more or less the same . The tribute is that these old planes are still flying while the others has been disbanded in plane graveyards .  Kosmonooit - Cockpit looks good to me - no fancy computers that de-skill pilots and make them lazy , so lazy that they forget how to fly the frigging aeroplane  Blackwolf - This article is very misleading . I travel every 28 days on flights all over the world . In the last decade I have travelled on much much worse than this . Try flying domestic in the Congo , Nigeria flying unlike some modern aircraft 's that have crashed this year , this proves the latest and greatest is not always the safest .  24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our Comments Policy .
