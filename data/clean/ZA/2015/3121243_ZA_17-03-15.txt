A people in bondage  17 March 2015 , 12:18  One of the most harped-on episodes in history is Nazi Germany and the holocaust , - the persecution and annihilation of more than six million Jews by a crazed dictator who had a hold of the German people by means of upholding a culture of absolute fear . Some may argue that it was n't fear , but given a choice , most lucid Germans would not have acquiesced to the treatment meted out to Jews , had the fear of the SS , Gestapo and other police organisations not been so terrifying to even them .  There have been countless movies made and books written on this subject . - and quite rightly so too ; It deals with what happens when the human race goes rogue , turns on itself , and unleashes the dark side , the evil side of our being , on our own . We are after all , all human beings , who bleed the same shade of red the world over , who have the same emotions happiness and peace for ourselves and for our loved ones .  Now apart from the Jew-haters , generally hailing from the lunatic fringe , who purport that it never happened ; of course we all know that it very definitely did , and that in retrospect , - and with the benefit of hindsight , the majority of us would have done anything in our power to have stopped the absolutely barbaric slaughter of innocent men , women , children and infants . We 're not talking about any quick exits here . We 're talking about the systematic , purposefully prolonged torture of a people , where those in power enforced their twisted and evil intent , ensuring an unspeakable misery being plied on normal and innocent people .  There is a quote by Primo Levi on the wall of the Jewish Holocaust Centre near Melbourne in Australia that says : " It happened , so it can happen again . That is the essence of what we have to say . " It means that we may not forget what people did to other people there . trivialise the holocaust , it may happen again in some form or fashion .  Should something similar arise , how do we ensure that we do n't remain bystanders , who are in essence passive offenders , again ? I ask this question , because it is happening again , albeit with a slightly different spin . I 'm referring , of course , to North Korea , where the state , by means of instilling an unnatural and terrible fear in its own people , remains in power , and wreaks havoc on the lives of ordinary people , causing them to turn on their own , and act in forced and unnatural ways .  Just as the Nazis identified Jews who they appointed as guards of other Jews in the ghettos and concentration camps , the North Koreans ensure a constant torrent of lies and propaganda , and have police and army personnel who are compelled to brutalise not only other North Koreans , but also their neighbours and in many cases , even their own family members . They keep people in prisons for the merest pamphlets , dropped by the South Koreans , watching an American movie , expressing the slightest disapproval of their living conditions in their " worker 's paradise " or even displaying unhappy faces at public events .  They die of starvation in hordes with many families being wiped out in this way , while non-attendance of political rallies is punishable by being summarily thrown into concentration camps where hard labour is the order of the day , and many die from hunger , malnutrition and being physically overworked . Vibrantly feigned enthusiasm is a prerequisite at such rallies , and when watching them perform their colourful and intricate folk dances , you can sense the terror in the faces . The fear factor is so great that many even report their own friends and family to state institutions , so as to be seen to be conforming vigorously themselves . Their jails have been described as being cages unfit for animals , where men and women are kept naked , and are regularly beaten , tortured , abused and starved , where cruelty and barbarism are the norm , and the West and that South Korea are evil , are told many deceitful stories like a recently heard one ; that there are no birds there . The birds have been eaten and destroyed by the gluttonous and greedy Westerners , and that life there is harder than what they know in their own country . Such things are designed to eventually change the psyche and thought patterns of their own people , brain-washing them into the acceptance of their plight and fate , of their hunger and their misery , as an unfortunate part of life , so as to keep them in the worst kind of servitude , and allow their very well fed leader to be able to continue to live in the lap of luxury , always ensuring that such excesses are well hidden from the eyes of his people .  We citizens of this world have a choice , and that choice matters hugely , just as it would have should we 'd have been able to bring World War II to an end , and the Nazis to their knees a week , or did . We need to not only raise awareness of the North Korean situation , but we also need to lobby each of our own leaders ( such as they are ) when and wherever we can , to urgently affect change in that country , as soon as possible .  We need to understand what motivated and drove the rescuers of the concentration camp prisoners , what drove the leaders of the free world at that time , and we need to work toward freeing the people of North Korea , and bring their illegitimate leader to book as soon as we can . There are crimes against humanity taking place there with absolute impunity . History will eventually judge the other leaders of our world harshly , knowing , again with hindsight that they could have done more , that they could have acted more decisively , and that they could have staved off the unnecessary and unjustified suffering of millions of innocents , to the benefit of mankind .  Without the will to better the lives of others of our own kind wherever we can ; of those who are held under duress without cause , we are no better than any of the wild beasts that care not about their lineage , siblings or kind ; Who have no plan , thought or care for tomorrow , and who eventually have no hope for the future , living for the present - blissfully unaware that in slightly altered circumstance , the same fate might easily befall them .
