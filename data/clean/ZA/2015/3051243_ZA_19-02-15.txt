" if you look at tuks , they brought a lot of experienced players from their first team like thabo mnyamane , grant kekana , mpho maruping . we used mostly our academy players with only thabo september as the senior player .  " so for me , considering that , i think we played very well . we took them all the way to the penalties , " tembo told supersport.com .  supersport took the lead after 23 minutes through striker kwanele zulu , who rounded off the keeper to score . dikgang ngcobo put tuks level when he headed from a corner in the 36th minute .  " we played about 40 chances . with a little bit of luck i think we could have won the game in regulation time .  " but you know the story with penalties , it 's a lottery , anything can happen , " he continued .  " i think there was tired legs as well after playing 40 minutes with ten men . and you could see the concentration level during those penalty shootouts , as well as the pressure , i think it got to the youngsters .  " but i 'm really proud , i think we gave a good account of ourselves , " tembo said .  supersport were without midfielder morne nel and striker ryan chapman , who were both with the first team . the coach admits that their absence weakened the side .  " most definitely , if you look at our games they 've always been the pillar for the team because they 've got psl experience . ryan as a striker , and we did n't have anyone like him upfront , who could hold the ball , who could lead the chances that we created , i think we could have scored two or three goals there , " he stressed .  " and with morne as well , his presence and creativity in midfield , we lacked that a little bit . "  bronze  matsatsantsha take on mpumalanga black aces , who lost 2-1 to mamelodi sundowns , in the third place playoff at the nike football training centre in pimville , soweto , on february 28 .
