" initially , these new laws impacted volumes negatively in adcorp 's core south african market where a number of contract staff were either taken on as permanent employees by clients or simply had their contracts of employment terminated , " says adcorp group ceo , richard pike .  " in response to this net loss of volumes , the group successfully embarked on a major operational restructure during the year , focused on shedding costs and attracting new business which offset much of the negative impact of , says pike , the group 's " cash performance has once again been extremely positive " .  pike says the new labour laws led to uncertainty , which related to the status of contract workers . this was clarified in september during a labour court ruling .  " the integration of the operations of the kelly group is now complete and , although kelly 's white collar operations were similarly , negatively affected by the recent changes to south african labour laws , the acquisition will benefit the group going forward , " he says .  adcorp 's international operations , in australia , were buoyed by deals .
