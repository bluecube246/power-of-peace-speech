kingsley holgate sets off to ethopia 's ' ocean of salt '  kingsley holgate , ambassador for land rover 's hope crosses any terrain initiatice , has set off on his latest expedition into africa  among a sway of colorful traditional dancing , ululations and praise , african adventurer kingsley holgate left south africa this past week with his son , ross , and their team in a convoy of specially kitted-out land rovers on his latest journey : circumnavigating chew bahir in ethopia .  located in the great rift valley , chew bahir -- which means " ocean of salt " in amharic -- has a rate of evaporation four times higher than anywhere else in the world . it 's not exactly the most comfortable destination , but that 's never deterred kingsley and his team .  this time , their focus will be to explore and document the cultural practices of lesser-known tribes in the 64km-long and 24km-wide lake region , while delivering much-needed aid such as mosquito nets , 5 000 pairs of reading glasses and 3 000 lifestraws to better people 's lives -- how good does that feel ? " kingsley says , his eyes crinkling with mirth . " because a day on these journeys is n't complete if we have n't helped someone . in a nutshell , this is why we travel . "  kingsley holgate and son , ross , set off on their ethiopian adventure on 22 june 2016 ( picture : land rover )  the adventure forms part of land rover 's social responsibility arm , hope crosses any terrain , which runs development , humanitarian and conservation projects in south and sub-saharan africa .  at 70 , and with his trademark beard looking more grey than blonde , kingsley still speaks with enthusiasm for travelling . chew bahir will be his 22nd expedition .  " my father was a missionary teacher , and me and three older brothers travelled with him throughout the congo . it was a hugely fascinating childhood : living the adventurers of african explorers . so the seed for adventure was instilled in me at a very young age , and the moment , i took it . "  it 's a love that 's instilled in his family , and especially in his son , ross holgate , who 's accompanied his father on every expedition .  " i would always sit at my father 's feet when he came back home in kwazulu-natal from his travels and was enthralled by the stories he told , " ross explains . " when i was old enough , we decided that every year , we should always do a father-and-son adventure . however , these were limited to south africa because in those days , south african passports were n't welcome in africa . "  using adventure to better people 's lives -- how good does that feel ?  " but straight after school , when that beautiful wind of change swept over south africa in 1994 , we decided to take advantage of that and came up with this ridiculous idea to travel from the most southern point of africa to the most northern in land rovers , " he says with a grin . " that was our year to complete . "  while their efforts are purely genuine , with a radicalised sentiment of self-determination that 's spreading across south africa and the continent , there 's a sense that kingsley 's travels are reminiscent of the african missionaries travelling into " deep , dark africa " to save the black soul .  " we are always a pan-african team , " kingsley responds . " for example , our malaria education talks are always done in the language of the area . and crucially , we always travel with local africans so we are not seen as a bunch of ' white missionary saviours ' pulling into the village . we are seen as being part of the village and part of the community . "  he adds that whatever activity they do in a village , they always ensure that it is fun and inclusive , encouraging villagers to bring musical instruments and mats to enjoy the day . " we do n't have this wagging finger : you better use mosquito nets . we learnt that lesson a long time ago . of my way to compensate for it and not look down on people and their lives . this is the heart of ubuntu for me -- learning a few words in the local language , learning from great people and following protocol . i 'm always very sensitive to this so as not to offend .  " but key to the success of our expeditions is not doing things in isolation . we can not do these trips without local africans . when i give talks at 4 ? 4 clubs , i 'm always asked what is the most important thing to carry on your travels , and they always expect me to say a spare wheel or a tool box , and are quite amazed whenever i say ' an extra seat or two to travel with local africans ' . "  fully kitted land rovers  after a warm traditional send-off , the team sets off with kingsley behind the wheel of ndhlovukazi ( elephant ) , a land rover defender 130 he also used in 2015 to travel to the geographical " heart of africa the congo where they could travel between only 200 and 300 meters a day .  on this trip , they will also be using two land rover discoveries named turkana and phokot , named after great rift valley areas in kenya and uganda .  being land rovers , the vehicles are pretty capable as it is , but africa is n't for the faint-hearted , so the vehicles have also been fitted with a list of genuine land rover accessories including bull bars , front under protection plates , spotlights , snorkels , roof racks , ladders and heavy-duty tow hitches in the rear and front .  kingsley 's ndhlovukazi ( elephant ) , a land rover defender 130 he used on his past trip in 2015 .
