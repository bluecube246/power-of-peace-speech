JOHANNESBURG -- Former African National Congress ( ANC ) treasurer-general Mathews Phosa says former President Thabo Mbeki 's economic and political wisdom could be of great value in finding solutions to the country 's crises .  Phosa says Mbeki should be given a platform to make contributions toward resolving South Africa 's woes and the ruling party should form an elder 's council .  Last week the former president lashed out at those who accused him of being paranoid , saying he had never made a decision on whether Phosa , Tokyo Sexwale and Cyril Ramaphosa were involved in a plot against him .  Phosa says Mbeki should n't be judged for his previous mistakes , but rather the contributions he could make toward solving the country 's economic woes .  " The good he 's done overshadows the mistakes he made . At all times we should recognise his political corporate memory as former head of state . "  He says Mbeki 's track record as the former head of state speaks for itself , both on the economic and political days after Mbeki distanced himself from claims that he was paranoid about a plot involving Phosa to have him removed from office .
