johannesburg -- former african national congress ( anc ) treasurer-general mathews phosa says former president thabo mbeki 's economic and political wisdom could be of great value in finding solutions to the country 's crises .  phosa says mbeki should be given a platform to make contributions toward resolving south africa 's woes and the ruling party should form an elder 's council .  last week the former president lashed out at those who accused him of being paranoid , saying he had never made a decision on whether phosa , tokyo sexwale and cyril ramaphosa were involved in a plot against him .  phosa says mbeki should n't be judged for his previous mistakes , but rather the contributions he could make toward solving the country 's economic woes .  " the good he 's done overshadows the mistakes he made . at all times we should recognise his political corporate memory as former head of state . "  he says mbeki 's track record as the former head of state speaks for itself , both on the economic and political days after mbeki distanced himself from claims that he was paranoid about a plot involving phosa to have him removed from office .
