Rebels in Syria fought with rare , expensive Nazi-made rifles  World War II history buffs are going to lose their minds . A Syrian rebel faction called the al-Tawhid Brigade stumbled on an arms cache of 5,000 German WWII-era Sturmgwehr 44 ( STG-44 ) rifles .  The STG-44 was designed to increase the volume of fire for German infantry units fighting on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Red Army . It accomplished this mission but was developed too late in the war to make an impact .  A German soldier demonstrates a Sturmgwehr equipped with a scope during testing in 1943 .  The rebels thought they 'd found a cache of Ak-47s . The two do n't look that much alike , but it 's understandable how the ill-armed and ill-equipped group would get excited at their find anyway .  We Are The Mighty  Besides , there 's little reason to see how 5,000 Nazi-built rifles worth an estimated $30,000 apiece ended up in the Syrian desert .  The al-Tawhid Brigade was an Islamist faction originally allied with the government of Bashar al-Asad . In 2013 , the al-Tawhid Brigade along with 11 other factions , would leave the Coalition and join al-Qaeda . That same year , its head commander died of wounds sustained in a Syrian government air strike and the group 's membership would defect to the various other groups fighting pro-Asad forces . The group is now defunct .  There is no word on what happened to the rare , expensive Nazi relics . For those keeping tabs at home , that 's a $150 million dollar loss .  Keep an eye out for those STG-44s . They 've shown up in state-sponsored gun buybacks in California and Connecticut .  Read the original article on We Are The Mighty . Copyright 2016 .
