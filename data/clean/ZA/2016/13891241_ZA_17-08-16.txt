' how so when you have lost support and got less than 50 percent ? " Malema asked . <p> There was no mayoral position for MP Thoko Didiza , the ANC 's Tshwane mayoral candidate , said Malema . <p> " Thoko Didiza , we shall meet in Parliament . There is no mayoral position for you , no matter what happens , or else be prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mzwandile Masina , we 're working very hard to make sure you do not become a mayor in Ekurhuleni because that municipality deserves a better person , and you are not that person . Nelson Mandela Bay is a sad one ... no mayor in Danny Jordaan , he must face the charges at FIFA , " Malema said . <p> Regarding ANC 's Johannesburg mayoral candidate Parks Tau , Malema said he must be prepared to let go of blue light vehicles and walk ' the streets like all of us ' . <p> The EFF would not form part of any coalition at councils . The party said it would support the Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) in KwaZulu-Natal , the DA in Gauteng 's hung municipalities and in Eastern Cape 's Nelson Mandela Bay . In Rustenburg , at which the ANC needed just two seats to govern , Malema said his party would support the Forum 4 Service Delivery ( F4SD ) an umbrella for independents councillors . <p> Malema said talks were underway with the DA in Johannesburg over ' a small matter ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they reached an agreement . He vowed that the governing party would never get ' a single EFF vote ' at councils .
