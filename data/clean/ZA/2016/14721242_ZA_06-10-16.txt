<h> Dear Hlaudi ... <p> 06 October 2016 , 09:31 <p> Dear Hlaudi , <p> I write you this open letter , in response to the open letter you wrote over the weekend , addressing all your " detractors " . <p> Much to my bemusement , instead of addressing the fact that the Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that your position as COO of the SABC was to be set aside , you gave a flawless account of your qualifications and *your* rights , both civil and human . <p> What you clearly fail to understand Mr Motsoeneng , is that you benefitted illegally from the position of COO at our state run broadcaster . It seems to have escaped your attention , that during your tenure as COO , the SABC has posted annual losses totalling over R1 Billion . <p> However , as we have come to expect from highly connected cadres inserted into positions of power , you have washed your hands of all blame for the dismal state of the SABC . <p> I 'd like to point out a couple of facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Qualified for the position or not , the SABC has become a burden on the tax paying citizens of South Africa . In any other company , you would have been given the boot a long time ago . <p> 2 . Your accomplishments do n't amount to much when the quality and content of SABC owned stations are antiquated ( at best ) and censored in the name of " good news " . <p> 3 . You awarded yourself ridiculous pay increases on numerous occasions , despite failing your duties at EVERY level . Let 's not even mention the bonuses you received for running the SABC into the ground . <p> 4 . You flouted countless constitutional laws on so many levels , when deciding to censor the violent protests happening around the country . <p> 5 . Aside from your brash , patronizing attitude at the SABC , you used Mandoza 's funeral as a platform to voice your agenda regarding the SABC and your detractors . This act was vile , not only from a professional but a personal level . <p> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SABC journalists who showed true integrity when protesting against the draconian censorship you put in place . <p> You mentioned last week that you are a miracle worker . The only miracle you can take credit for , is the fact that you have not been brought up on charges of corruption , negligent spending of state funds and benefitting from a position that you obtained with FALSE qualifications . <p> Despite the many rights of journalists YOU trampled on during your censorship blitzkrieg , you have the audacity to complain about your rights ! ? ! <p> In light of all of the above , I will no longer be complicate in funding a corrupt , morally bankrupt company . I hereby declare that I will not be paying my TV license anymore . I would also encourage all those reading this letter to do the same . Trust me - It 's the right thing to do . <p> I hope that you , or someone at the top of the food chain comes to their senses and fires you with the almighty disdain you so rightly deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , I would n't hold my breath . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

She has bounced back from a devastating loss to a little-known African-American senator in the democratic nomination race in 2008 with a southern Texas-like swagger to lift herself close to breaking the proverbial glass ceiling . Read more ... <p> The resounding call for free tertiary education in South Africa under the hashtag #feesmustfall , has been a growing movement well supported and motivated by many figures in particular varsity students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> What I have observed this time is that the current crop of #feesmustfall protesters are not dedicated students . Instead , they were disgruntled , lazy students who most probably spent more time trying to be popular and activist wannabes instead of studying .
