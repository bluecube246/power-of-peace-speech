NEW YORK -- More than 6 million people in Nigeria , Niger , Chad and Cameroon face severe hunger , including 1 million on the edge of famine , as a result of Boko Haram violence , aid agencies said on Friday as they appealed for more money to tackle the regional crisis .  The Islamist group 's seven year insurgency to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria has killed 15,000 people and forced 2.4 million to flee their homes .  More than 65,000 people are living in famine in pockets of northeast Nigeria , and over one million others are " one step away " from famine , a coalition of 15 aid groups including Oxfam , the International What we are seeing is families teetering on the edge of famine , " Yannick Pouchalan , country director for Nigeria for Action Against Hunger , said in a statement .  " We see families who have not eaten for days , many are begging for food . "  In some areas of Nigeria 's Borno state , more than half of children under five suffer acute malnutrition , similar to the rates seen in Somalia in 2011 , when the scale and severity of hunger led to a declaration of famine , the aid groups said .  They said the conflict and counter-insurgency operations had led to farmlands , rivers and lakes being cut off from communities in and around the Lake Chad area that rely on agriculture and fishing to feed themselves .  " Civilians have paid a high price for policies of cutting off Boko Haram 's food and supplies , " said Oxfam 's Lisa Bay in a statement .  " We have seen hugely generous communities welcome people who have fled their homes , but now they have nothing to give . "  The coalition appealed for money to respond to the emergency , noting that a UN appeal for $740 million to help those displaced by Boko Haram violence was less than a quarter funded .  It called for $90 million by the end of the year on top of $53 million received this year .  On Tuesday , US President Barack Obama said he and Nigerian President Mohammadu Buhari had discussed ways of countering the militant group .  Nigeria is battling Boko Haram on the ground and with air strikes . A multi-national joint task force - comprising troops from Nigeria and neighbouring Niger , Cameroon , Chad and Benin - is also fighting the militants .  Last weekend , soldiers killed 38 Boko Haram fighters during operations that followed earlier attacks by the Islamist group on two border towns in southeastern Niger .  In New York , representatives of the countries affected by Boko Haram violence said humanitarian priorities included healthcare , food , drinking water and shelter .
