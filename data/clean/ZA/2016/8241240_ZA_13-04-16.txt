He succeeds Brian Molefe , who was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Eskom last October .  Brown says Gama has the necessary experience to run the parastatal .  " Mr Gama has 14 years in most of the companies of Transnet , and of course Transnet is one of our best performing state-owned companies and I am pleased that Cabinet has agreed to his appointment . "  Minister Brown says she 's confident Gama has the experience to run Transnet , despite whistle-blowers writing letters claiming he has a controversial past .  She says while she 's taken each whistle-blower 's letter into consideration , she is more interested in Gama 's skills .  " Gama has very good understanding knowledge of the running of freight logistics , ports and so forth . He has held the reigns for the last couple of months and he has held them very well . I am more than convinced he will be able to do it . "  She says there was an investigation into issues brought up by whistle-blowers and they were range of issues that I eventually gave to the board . The board made sure that they investigated all of those issues , and the board found that they were not true . "
