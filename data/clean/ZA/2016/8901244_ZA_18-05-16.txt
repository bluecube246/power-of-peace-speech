<h> Injured Jobodwana retains focus on Olympic medal <h> ' I 'm being very cautious , but I think I 'm in the final stages of rehab . ' <p> Sprinter Anaso Jobodwana is confident he can earn a medal at the Rio Olympics , though he remains locked in a race against time as he tries to shake off a pelvic injury less than three months ahead of the Games . <p> Jobodwana confirmed on Wednesday he had parted ways with British coach Stuart McMillan and abandoned his training base in Phoenix , Arizona , with the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee ( Sascoc ) sending him to Durban to work with Dr Kevin Suddan at the Prime Institute high performance and sports medicine centre . <p> " I 'm being very cautious , but I think I 'm in the final stages of rehab , " said the 23-year-old speedster , who has not raced since picking up the pelvic injury in the 100m heats at the African Games in Brazzaville eight months ago . <p> " I see the doctor every day and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the track I 've built confidence because I 've come off the track feeling good and I wake up the next day without repercussions from the training , " he said . <p> " The doctor said to me yesterday that I was in a good place to move up to a higher intensity . " <p> Jobodwana was sidelined for the entire 2014 season due to a sports hernia , which required an operation , but he bounced back last year to earn the 200m bronze medal at the World Championships in Beijing , clocking a national record of 19.87 seconds . <p> Having gained plenty experience at international level since reaching the half-lap final as a teenager at the 2012 London Olympics , he believed he could hit the ground running in Rio , even if he was forced to run his first race of 2016 in the opening round at the Games . <p> Ideally , however , he hoped to turn out in at least two top-flight league meetings in Europe in July , in order to sharpen up before the multi-sport showpiece . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so by the time I get to Rio I 'm not stepping into an arena where I 'm out of my league . <p> " Coming from world champs , I know I 'm capable of doing it . " <p> Jobodwana said he was in the process of finding a new coach , and though he had started discussions with a potential mentor , negotiations were ongoing .
