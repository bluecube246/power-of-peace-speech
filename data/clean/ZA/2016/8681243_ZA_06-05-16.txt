<p> " I am really enjoying working under Stuart , he is improving my game and helping me become a better player . Hopefully as long as he is here , I can stick around , he is a good coach , so I am hoping he does n't move on soon but football can be a funny old world . " <p> Baxter joined SuperSport in January and has helped a side that was struggling under Gordon Igesund to get into the top eight in the Absa Premiership and reach the Nedbank Cup semifinals . <p> " He has brought a lot of structure and understanding of the game and the way we want to play , it is very enjoyable , all the players have smiles on their faces , there is a nice atmosphere before and after games . We are really learning a lot , " added Brockie.
