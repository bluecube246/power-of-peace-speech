" i am really enjoying working under stuart , he is improving my game and helping me become a better player . hopefully as long as he is here , i can stick around , he is a good coach , so i am hoping he does n't move on soon but football can be a funny old world . "  baxter joined supersport in january and has helped a side that was struggling under gordon igesund to get into the top eight in the absa premiership and reach the nedbank cup semifinals .  " he has brought a lot of structure and understanding of the game and the way we want to play , it is very enjoyable , all the players have smiles on their faces , there is a nice atmosphere before and after games . we are really learning a lot , " added brockie.
