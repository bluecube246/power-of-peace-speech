Biya said in a statement read on state radio that Lydienne Yen-Ayoum , a Cameroonian who acquired French nationality after marrying a Frenchman , would no longer have to serve the remainder of her sentence .  Arrested in January 2008 , she was sentenced to 25 years in jail in September 2014 and has so far spent eight years in prison .  The Supreme Court last year upheld the sentence but Yen-Ayoum has always proclaimed her innocence .  " It 's a miracle . She is being freed from prison this evening , " her lawyer Caroline Wassermann said in Paris .  Yen-Ayoum was arrested along with several others in an anti-corruption sweep . Most of those arrested said they were the victims of a political witch-hunt .
