" <p> Murray 's comeback has been nothing short of miraculous after he had to wait months before doing any proper overhead work in the swimming pool . <p> He made his return to competition winning his maiden ITU World Duathlon title in June before signalling his return at the World Triathlon event in Hamburg . <p> The men 's triathlon raced over the 1.5km swim , a 40km bike ride and a 10km run will be a close affair between some of the world 's racers . <p> London 2012 silver medalist Spain 's Javier Gomez considered one of the contender was ruled out of the Games after a minor bike crash in training . <p> His injury has narrowed the field slightly with the Briton Alistair Brownlee aiming to become the first triathlete to retain his title while his brother Jonny , who won the bronze in London would also be in the mix . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top triathletes in the world since he finished 19th at the London Olympic Games . <p> " The likes of the Brownlees ( British brothers Alistair and Jonny ) , and the French athletes would be to try and get away with the swim , " Murray said . <p> " I think it is going to be one of those cat-and-mouse type of games again at the Olympics , I think I 'd be able to pull back on the bike and be in contention for a medal . " <p> Joining Murray in the men 's race in Rio , Schoeman has also made serious advances in world triathlon ranked top-10 in the world . <p> The country 's two female triathletes Mari Rabie and Gillian Sanders will be competing at their second Olympics respectively on Saturday . <p> Sanders finished 19th place in London 2012 while Rabie will turn out at her second Games , eight years after her debut in Beijing 2008. - Independent Media
