<p> South Africa 's trade in the iconic African grey parrot may be contributing to the bird 's decline , say conservation campaigners participating in the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to Cites , in Johannesburg . <p> A decision on former world number one tennis player Maria Sharapova 's appeal against a two-year doping ban will be issued in the first week of next month , the Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Tuesday . <h> SA pop group The Parlotones are spitting mad after they visited the SA Embassy in Germany to report their passports as stolen and were greeted with only " disrespect and unwillingness " . <h> Save &amp; Share <h> Related News <p> The group , who are currently in the middle of a European tour , took to Facebook recently to reveal that they had been robbed of almost all of their personal belongings while on a stop in Dresden , Germany . <p> " Bad news : our van was just broken into in Dresden . They stole all our laptops and wallets , including Kahn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all our instruments so the show will go on ! " the group wrote . <p> " I had the worst possible experience at the South African embassy in Berlin today , I 've never experienced such disrespect and unwillingness to help from apparently an individual that 's meant to be a civil servant , " the group 's frontman Kahn Morbee wrote on the band 's Facebook page . <p> Kahn said that the group would follow the " official channels to complain " but asked fans to help them find someone at the London embassy who would be able to assist . <p> They have since resumed touring and took to their Facebook page on Saturday to report that they were in better spirits .
