<p> Do n't point fingers at each other . One Messi is from Argentina but he grew up at Barcelona . The injury was not caused by Barcelona . And I do n't think Barcelona will be happy to miss him too . They need the league and every trophy so pointing fingers will not help . <p> imagine benching messi in a game against atletico madrid COACHES are not profets where they foresee a player to get an injury .... Agree with me Barcelona is not itself without messi .. .. i wih him a speedy recovery
