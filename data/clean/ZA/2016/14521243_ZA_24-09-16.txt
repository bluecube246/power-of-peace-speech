do n't point fingers at each other . one messi is from argentina but he grew up at barcelona . the injury was not caused by barcelona . and i do n't think barcelona will be happy to miss him too . they need the league and every trophy so pointing fingers will not help .  imagine benching messi in a game against atletico madrid coaches are not profets where they foresee a player to get an injury .... agree with me barcelona is not itself without messi .. .. i wih him a speedy recovery
