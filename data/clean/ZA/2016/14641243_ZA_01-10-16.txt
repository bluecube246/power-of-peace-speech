SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter welcomes FIFA break  SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter says the FIFA break will allow his team a chance to " sharpen their swords and lick their wounds " .  Matsatsantsa have been struck by the injury bug , as the likes of Cole Alexander , Grant Kekana , Fagrie Lakay , Dove Wome , David Mathebula , Bradley Grobler , Clayton Daniels and Thabo Makhele struggle for fitness on the sidelines .  SuperSport are also carefully monitoring the knee of new signing Tefu Mashamaite , who was on the bench in a 1-1 draw with Golden Arrows at Princess Magogo Stadium on Wednesday .  " That 's welcome and very , very welcome , " says Baxter of the international recess .  " You talk about continuity and we had no continuity so far . Look at Aubrey ( Modiba ) , he has played a lot of football and has not really had time to miss the games and get to the way we play .  " We 've got a couple of other players a chance to sharpen the swords and lick our wounds , and come back rejuvenated hopefully . "  United , touted as title contenders in pre-season , are eighth on the Absa Premiership table with six points from five games .  Baxter 's men will resume their campaign against promoted Highlands Park at Lucas Moripe Stadium on October 16 .  Terms of use :  The comments posted do not reflect the views of KickOff.com .
