To his surprise , Montisetsi was told by security guards placed at the entrance that management had given them a directive not to let them in as they only recognised the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Workers Union ( AMCU ) which represents the majority of their mineworkers .  " When we got to the gate , we were informed that management had cancelled the meeting because there would be conflict . It was a surprise to us because we asked for a meeting last week Wednesday and everything was confirmed .  " Our problem is that people are still trapped underground and we do n't know if they are still alive or dead ... so we wanted to meet with Vantage Goldfields management as a union which has experience in the mining industry , " said Montisetsi , who drove close to three hours to get to Barberton .

NUM called us earlier last week to set up a meeting because they also wanted access to the mines to meet the families and we told them that we could not give them access because there is no members on the mine that belong to their union , " said Zietsman .  He went on to say that NUM representatives were making noise outside the gate to try and make them change their mind about denying them entry .  " We did n't allow them to come in for that very same reason and neither do they hold any authority with the families , " said Zietsman , adding that families have since gone back to their homes .
