however , there will be no love lost between the two when their sides square off in the absa premiership according to tinkler .  " roger and i , we 've been teammates and we 've worked together at a club but when it comes to field we are committed to our jobs you know , " tinkler tells kick off.com .  " on the field of play there 's no friendship , afterwards that friendship will always remain and it will never die .  " it 's another derby . i came from derbies in joburg and coming here to another big derby is actually where you want to be .  " they are the enjoyable games and the games you want to be involved in . "  tinkler , who has just recently returned from an overseas vacation to portugal , oversaw city 's first official training session yesterday .  the former bafana bafana midfielder acknowledged that the team still has a long way to go although that was understandable considering the circumstances .  " i 'm very club , " tinkler said . " you know its a new project . a big dream that john ( comitis ) has and i 'm proud to be a part of it and i hope i can make a success of it . "  " the intensity is obviously going to pick up and fitness levels are obviously not where it should be at this stage of the season .  " so i think its a little early to judge people but let 's have a look at them again for a couple of days and make our decision by next week .
