<p> However , there will be no love lost between the two when their sides square off in the Absa Premiership according to Tinkler . <p> " Roger and I , we 've been teammates and we 've worked together at a club but when it comes to field we are committed to our jobs you know , " Tinkler tells Kick Off.com . <p> " On the field of play there 's no friendship , afterwards that friendship will always remain and it will never die . <p> " It 's another derby . I came from derbies in Joburg and coming here to another big derby is actually where you want to be . <p> " They are the enjoyable games and the games you want to be involved in . " <p> Tinkler , who has just recently returned from an overseas vacation to Portugal , oversaw City 's first official training session yesterday . <p> The former Bafana Bafana midfielder acknowledged that the team still has a long way to go although that was understandable considering the circumstances . <p> " I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , " Tinkler said . " You know its a new project . A big dream that John ( Comitis ) has and I 'm proud to be a part of it and I hope I can make a success of it . " <p> " The intensity is obviously going to pick up and fitness levels are obviously not where it should be at this stage of the season . <p> " So I think its a little early to judge people but let 's have a look at them again for a couple of days and make our decision by next week .
