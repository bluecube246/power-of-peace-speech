<h> America 's shameful attitude towards Paralympic Games <p> Olympics / 8 September 2016 , 4:30pm <p> Ian Herbert <p> At a press conference in Rio de Janeiro three weeks ago , the leaders of the United States delegation did n't even seem to have worked out how to mark the winning of their 1,000th Olympic gold medal of all time . Collecting them was such a breeze that they muttered something about " special plans " being in store and , you imagined , wandered off to make them . The women 's 4x100m medley swimmers did the honours , collecting one of 46 golds secured by a peerless Olympian team which captivated the American nation . <p> It says everything for the different country that the US Paralympians occupy that at the Games which start on Thursday they may have their work cut out simply beating Ukraine , a nation still in the throes of bitter military conflict . Ukraine finished 30 places behind the US in the Rio Olympics medal table but one place ahead of them at London 's 2012 Paralympics . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often gone for a nation which has only once made it beyond fourth place in the medals table on foreign soil . EPA/JENS BUTTNER . Credit : EPA <p> The US 's sixth place in London reflected the way Paralympics have often gone for a nation which has only once made it beyond fourth place in the medals table on foreign soil . The poor return is not a coincidence . The fervour felt here in the UK for Paralympic athletes is simply not matched on the other side of the Atlantic . <p> The flavour of the US media on Wednesday certainly suggested that the Paralympians are not of great interest , despite th supreme quality of their sport . It 's a busy time , coast to coast , with the US Open at Flushing Meadows and the NFL season about to unfold . But the Paralympics did not feature anywhere in the mix of the New York Times , Washington Post , or USA Today digital stories on Wednesday . Even NBC , which has the TV rights , has published minimal preview material this week on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pita Taufatofua remained NBC 's main Olympic stories on Tuesday , though Tatyana McFadden finally made it on the ' Olympic ' page on Wednesday . <p> NBC was criticised for its Paralympic programming at London 2012 , principally for not screening live sport and putting the output on its cable sports channel NBCSN . It says it is increasing its output this time , though most of the coverage will be relegated to cable channel again . <p> One thing that US Paralympian sport seems to lack is a talisman . The story of extraordinary Ukrainian success stems from Valeriy Sushkevych - the founder and president of the Paralympic Committee of Ukraine and two-time disabled swimming champion in the Soviet Union . Under his passionate leadership , as a member of the Ukrainian parliament , Ukraine developed a ground-breaking system of physical education and sport for young people with disabilities . <p> The US team struggle for funding , too . In part , that is because there is no central government funding , but disability rights advocates also say it reflects the lack of support in the US for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paralympic medal winner , said this week that the poor US performance " is reflective of the lack of support that disabled people get more generally . It 's always a day too late and dollar too short . " Disabled people tend to be largely absent from TV and cinema screens , not to mention the TV sports channels . <p> The impact of a well televised Paralympics can be extraordinary , shattering so many preconceptions . Anne Wafula-Strike , who represented Kenya at the 2000 Athens Games , provided a vivid sense of that when we spoke this week . Kenya at the turn of the century was beset by some of the desperate prejudice that the disabled in parts of western Africa still encounter . But when she returned to Kenya after becoming the first wheelchair racer to represent the country , she was mobbed . <p> " People walked up and touched me , especially the women , because to them it was n't real . I had gone and done the thing that ' only the white person can do ' , " said Wafula-Strike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has regularly visited the organisation 's vital school projects in Kenya . <p> Though the liberation many working class Kenyans felt seeing Wafula-Strike compete was on racial lines , it opened minds to what those with disability can do . " The Paralympics work like that , " she said . " It creates a international platform . When people get to see the games on TV or listening to the BBC World Service maybe in a village in Africa , they feel alive to us and the barriers drop . The whole world is watching and listening . " <p> Wafula-Strike tells of the disabled child she found living with animals during her efforts to elevate the importance of disability rights in Kenya . Light years away from the west and the United States , of course , but the way moving images of the Paralympics can transform perceptions is relevant to all nations . <p> Some extremely significant countries at the Games will have no Paralympics broadcast at all . There will be no TV coverage in India , as the Paralympics failed to attract any broadcasters there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . Pakistan - another country in which attitudes are primitive - has no broadcast either . It is no surprise that the same applies to Ghana , where some of the world 's worst disability discrimination has been witnessed . <p> In the United States , it is thought that a Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Olympics -- in which Paralympics would have parity with Olympics -- could bring the step-change in outlook . In the meantime , American Paralympic athletes hear of London 's plans to stage next summer 's Paralympics world championships before the event for the able-bodied and think that ours is a different world .
