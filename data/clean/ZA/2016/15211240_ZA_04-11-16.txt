According to a rehabilitation specialist , a physician should ask about the history of your back pain , including its exact location , what makes it feel better or worse and what may have caused it .  Back pain is a common problem , but most cases can be treated without surgery , a sports medicine specialist says .  Isolating the cause  Sometime during their lives , up to 80 percent of people will have back pain that lasts more than three days .  The first step in treating back pain is understanding it , according to Dr Gregory Billy , a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist with Penn State Sports Medicine .  " A physician should ask about the history of your pain , including its exact location , what makes it feel better or worse and what may have caused it , " Billy said in a university news release . " A physical exam helps isolate the cause of the pain -- for example , what happens when you stand , sit , lift your leg or walk ? MRIs of many older adults are likely to depict damage , but the damage captured in that image may not be the current cause of back pain , " Billy said .  For minor back pain , treatments include over-the-counter pain relievers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as ibuprofen , or applying ice to stop spasms and heat to relieve soreness/aching , he said .  It 's important to continue normal daily activities as much as possible . Too much time in bed can result in muscle and spine tightening , he added .
