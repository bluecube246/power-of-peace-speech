Tags :  The Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) of Titans cricket , Jacques Faul , says hosting cricket matches in August is here to stay and local venues will overcome the challenges in the future .  The second test between South Africa and New Zealand starts on Saturday in Centurion and Faul is confident that their outfield will be fit to play on for the whole game .  The outfield in Centurion is looking in tip top shape two days ahead of the start of the test .  Unfortunately , the first test in Durban could not be completed because the outfield was damaged by rain during the test .  The International Cricket Council has asked Cricket South Africa to explain , but even at Supersport Park it was a challenge to get the field ready in August .  Cricket stadia can not afford to stand empty for six months in between games when they can cover costs by hosting other functions .  " You commit to certain activities and that shortens your time to prepare , to re-lay favour , then you are in trouble . So it is difficult to blame anybody , " says Faul .  Cricket is also now following the path of other high profile sports like rugby so more games are being played , thus extending the season . " I think eventually we will get it right . We have got to realise that we can not just play in summer anymore . If I can choose between all the new challenges and not hosting a test then I will always choose hosting a test . This is where sport is going , seasonsare getting longer and longer and we will adapt to a better practice . "  On the opening day , the Titans will honour the South African National Defence Force ( SANDF ) .  The union has requested that fans show their support by wearing sporting camouflage clothing in honour of those SANDF members who lost their lives in the line of duty .
