<p> The injured pair stood in solidarity with the rest of the visiting fans on a freezing Merseyside afternoon , as Louis Van Gaal 's men looked to turn around their fortunes <p> EXTRA TIMEManchester United 's clash against Liverpool is always a global event , witnessed by millions of viewers across the planet - and two of Louis van Gaal 's stars ensured they soaked up the occasion . <p> Nobody wants to miss out on the game , especially the players who in other circumstances would be out there on the pitch , such as Red Devils pair Phil Jones and Michael Carrick . <p> But instead of watching on from the luxury of the directors ' box , it takes a special sort to brave the cold of the away end in Anfield and stand amongst fellow fans for the 90 minutes . <p> The United pair are currently on the clubs ' casualty list , the latter recovering from an ankle problem , but were present in the stands to watch their team-mates take on Liverpool on Sunday . <p> The Red Devils have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than exhilarating performances , but nobody can fault the attitude of these players who brave the elements to give their team a boost .
