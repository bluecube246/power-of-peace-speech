can the anc survive the all-out assault on finance minister pravin gordhan or will it split into two factions - one a band of grim cronies running the state 's security machinery and the other left-leaning technocrats who want to return to core values ?  maria sharapova said she could not wait to return to tennis next april after the court of arbitration for sport ( cas ) reduced the former world number one 's two-year drugs ban by nine months on tuesday .  the killing of the uitenhage teacher and subsequent investigation has gripped the country for the past 18 months .  jayde ? 29 ? was kidnapped from outside her port elizabeth home on april 21 last year while waiting for a friend to give her a lift .  her husband ? christopher ? was still asleep inside their kabega park townhouse ? none the wiser ? according to him ? when at least two men shoved jayde into the boot of a car and drove her to kwanobuhle ? outside uitenhage ? where she was executed .  on tuesday court as christopher stands trial .  the state claims he paid employee luthando siyoni to recruit hitmen to carry out the kidnapping and murder .  panayiotou is accused alongside sinethemba nemembe and zolani sibeko .  another accused ? sizwezakhe vumazonke ? has since died of a mystery illness .  while the state will set out to prove how these men conspired to carry out the hit ? the defence is adamant it will be able to show that siyoni was assaulted and forced to implicate panayiotou .  it will rely on the concept of " the fruit of a poisoned tree " ? arguing that all evidence following siyoni 's alleged assault should be deemed inadmissible .
