Can the ANC survive the all-out assault on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan or will it split into two factions - one a band of grim cronies running the state 's security machinery and the other left-leaning technocrats who want to return to core values ?  Maria Sharapova said she could not wait to return to tennis next April after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) reduced the former world number one 's two-year drugs ban by nine months on Tuesday .  The killing of the Uitenhage teacher and subsequent investigation has gripped the country for the past 18 months .  Jayde ? 29 ? was kidnapped from outside her Port Elizabeth home on April 21 last year while waiting for a friend to give her a lift .  Her husband ? Christopher ? was still asleep inside their Kabega Park townhouse ? none the wiser ? according to him ? when at least two men shoved Jayde into the boot of a car and drove her to KwaNobuhle ? outside Uitenhage ? where she was executed .  On Tuesday Court as Christopher stands trial .  The state claims he paid employee Luthando Siyoni to recruit hitmen to carry out the kidnapping and murder .  Panayiotou is accused alongside Sinethemba Nemembe and Zolani Sibeko .  Another accused ? Sizwezakhe Vumazonke ? has since died of a mystery illness .  While the state will set out to prove how these men conspired to carry out the hit ? the defence is adamant it will be able to show that Siyoni was assaulted and forced to implicate Panayiotou .  It will rely on the concept of " the fruit of a poisoned tree " ? arguing that all evidence following Siyoni 's alleged assault should be deemed inadmissible .
