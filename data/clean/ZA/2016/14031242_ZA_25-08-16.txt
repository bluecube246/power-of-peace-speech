Tags :  Disgruntled Lovedale College students in King William 's Town in the Eastern Cape have closed the gates at all the entrances to the institution , saying they have been without textbooks for a large part of this year .  Lovedale principal , Luvuyo Ngubelanga says they are dealing with the situation and textbooks are currently on the way .  Ngubelanga says , " It 's an issue of a particular textbook that we ordered that is out of circulation and as a result , because the book was not available from publishers , we had to change the textbook to try and find another one . "  " We found it and it has to go for printing , but the students are impatient with this process . They do n't understand that the book may not be available . That 's why they are protesting but we have solved problem . The book is on its way but the couriers say it 's in Port Elizabeth . These students do n't want to allow our cars to go and fetch added Ngubelanga.
