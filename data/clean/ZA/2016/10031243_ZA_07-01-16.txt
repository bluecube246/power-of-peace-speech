Below-par Safarova to skip Australian Open  AFP/File / Mohd FyrolLucie Safarova of the Czech Republic reacts after a point against Angelique Kerber of Germany during their women 's singles round robin tennis match at the WTA Finals in Singapore on October 30 , 2015  World number nine Lucie Safarova said Thursday she would skip the Australian Open because of health problems linked to a bacterial infection that saw her hospitalised for a week last September .  Prague ( AFP )  " The treatment of my bacterial infection has become complicated in recent days , " Safarova told AFP through her spokesman Karel Tejkal .  " I could n't do the training that would allow me to fly to the tournaments in Australia well prepared , " said Safarova , who won the doubles title at the 2015 Australian Open with Bethanie Mattek-Sands .  " That 's why I have decided to pull out , not to burden the organism by travelling , and focus on treatment and gradual convalescence , " added the 28-year-old left-handed Czech .  " My joints I and my coach would like . "  " The bio-chemical checks are not a hundred percent either , " Safarova said 11 days before the Australian Open starts in Melbourne .  Safarova , who played the French Open last year before catching the infection , has already pulled out of the Hopman Cup which is under way in Australia .  After the infection , Safarova returned in time for October 's WTA Finals in Singapore , where she failed to make it past the group stage .  She was also on the Czech Republic team that won the Fed Cup in mid-November but did not play because of an inflamed tendon in her left wrist .  Safarova said she could possibly manage the first-round Fed Cup tie in Romania on February 6-7 if everything went well .  " If not , I will focus on the US tournaments on the WTA circuit " scheduled for March , she added .
