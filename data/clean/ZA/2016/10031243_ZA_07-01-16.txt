" i could n't do the training that would allow me to fly to the tournaments in australia well prepared , " said safarova , who won the doubles title at the 2015 australian open with bethanie mattek-sands .  " that 's why i have decided to pull out , not to burden the organism by travelling , and focus on treatment and gradual convalescence , " added the 28-year-old left-handed czech .  " my joints i and my coach would like . "  " the bio-chemical checks are not a hundred percent either , " safarova said 11 days before the australian open starts in melbourne .  safarova , who played the french open last year before catching the infection , has already pulled out of the hopman cup which is under way in australia .  after the infection , safarova returned in time for october 's wta finals in singapore , where she failed to make it past the group stage .  she was also on the czech republic team that won the fed cup in mid-november but did not play because of an inflamed tendon in her left wrist .  safarova said she could possibly manage the first-round fed cup tie in romania on february 6-7 if everything went well .  " if not , i will focus on the us tournaments on the wta circuit " scheduled for march , she added .
