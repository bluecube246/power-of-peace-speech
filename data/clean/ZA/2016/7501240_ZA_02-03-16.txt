<h> Drought hits GDP numbers - Annette Steyn <p> The DA is deeply concerned about the future of the agriculture sector in South Africa , after fourth quarter and overall full year Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) numbers for 2015 were released by Stats SA today . The figures show an agriculture sector shrinking at an alarming rate , a culmination of inadequate government planning and economic stimuli , deepened by the effects of the current drought gripping the whole country . <p> According to the report , the agricultural sector shrunk by 14% during the 4th quarter of 2015 , and by 8.4% from 2014 to 2015 . This is the largest decline in the sector since 1995 . <p> Since the outbreak of the drought , 37 000 jobs in agriculture have been lost . There has also been a knock-on effect on the manufacturing sector , where 36 000 jobs have been lost , mostly in food processing . <p> If we do not unite in actively fighting the drought , South Africa 's economy will be brought to its knees , placing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation . The DA therefore again urges government to declare the current drought a national disaster in order to provide a coordinated response to the disaster .
