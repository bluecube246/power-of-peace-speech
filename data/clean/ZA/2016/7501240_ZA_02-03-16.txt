drought hits gdp numbers - annette steyn  the da is deeply concerned about the future of the agriculture sector in south africa , after fourth quarter and overall full year gross domestic product ( gdp ) numbers for 2015 were released by stats sa today . the figures show an agriculture sector shrinking at an alarming rate , a culmination of inadequate government planning and economic stimuli , deepened by the effects of the current drought gripping the whole country .  according to the report , the agricultural sector shrunk by 14% during the 4th quarter of 2015 , and by 8.4% from 2014 to 2015 . this is the largest decline in the sector since 1995 .  since the outbreak of the drought , 37 000 jobs in agriculture have been lost . there has also been a knock-on effect on the manufacturing sector , where 36 000 jobs have been lost , mostly in food processing .  if we do not unite in actively fighting the drought , south africa 's economy will be brought to its knees , placing food inflation . the da therefore again urges government to declare the current drought a national disaster in order to provide a coordinated response to the disaster .
