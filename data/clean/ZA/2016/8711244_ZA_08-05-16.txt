SA Communist Party ( SACP ) boss Blade Nzimande has called on banks to invest more in manufacturing and the productive economy rather than in shopping malls .  Nzimande 's remarks came in the wake of the grand opening of the ambitious Mall of Africa late last month in Midrand , northern Johannesburg .  Addressing the SACP provincial congress in Polokwane yesterday , Nzimande said the SACP would not invest in malls if it was in power .

" Something is going on there , " he said . " " They may start in one place and they start spreading throughout the country .  " It is not a just a Limpopo matter .
