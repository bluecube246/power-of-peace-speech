The resounding call for free tertiary education in South Africa under the hashtag #feesmustfall , has been a growing movement well supported and motivated by many figures in particular varsity students , some celebrities and some major organisations . Read more ...  What I have observed this time is that the current crop of #feesmustfall protesters are not dedicated students . Instead , they were disgruntled , lazy students who most probably spent more time trying to be popular and activist wannabes instead of studying . Read more ...
