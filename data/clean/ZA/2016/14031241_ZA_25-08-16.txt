tags :  parliament 's joint sitting of the two houses to debate national women 's day was delayed by absenteeism and mudslinging between the african national congress ( anc ) and opposition parties .  the debate quickly degenerated into one of the most divisive engagements in parliament .  ideally , this is supposed to be one of the most crucial debates in parliament but the empty chamber spoke volumes .  ironically , it was male legislators who raised concerns about what seemed to be a lack of interest in the event .  the united democratic movement 's ( udm ) nqaba nkwankwa says , " this issue was repeatedly raised in the chief whips ' forums that if members are busy with other activities , this should rather be postponed . "  the ruling party says there is a valid and legitimate reason why most mps were absent .  " honourable house chair , we all know that today is a funeral of one of our own , that 's number one , a former minister and an ambassador of a committee that is sitting next door , the finance committee deciding on a bill of 200 pages . they are only given five days to deal with it so please lets not come here and grandstand , " says anc chief whip , doris dlakude .  finally the debate continued , notwithstanding an empty chamber .  tributes were paid to women stalwarts who marched to the union building some decades ago .
