<h> Tags : <p> Parliament 's joint sitting of the two houses to debate National Women 's Day was delayed by absenteeism and mudslinging between the African National Congress ( ANC ) and opposition parties . <p> The debate quickly degenerated into one of the most divisive engagements in Parliament . <p> Ideally , this is supposed to be one of the most crucial debates in Parliament but the empty chamber spoke volumes . <p> Ironically , it was male legislators who raised concerns about what seemed to be a lack of interest in the event . <p> The United Democratic Movement 's ( UDM ) Nqaba Nkwankwa says , " This issue was repeatedly raised in the chief whips ' forums that if members are busy with other activities , this should rather be postponed . " <p> The ruling party says there is a valid and legitimate reason why most MPs were absent . <p> " Honourable house chair , we all know that today is a funeral of one of our own , that 's number one , a former minister and an ambassador of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee that is sitting next door , the finance committee deciding on a bill of 200 pages . They are only given five days to deal with it so please lets not come here and grandstand , " says ANC Chief Whip , Doris Dlakude . <p> Finally the debate continued , notwithstanding an empty chamber . <p> Tributes were paid to women stalwarts who marched to the Union Building some decades ago .
