<h> Why did Julius Malema just sell the EFF to the ANC ? <p> 06 October 2016 , 09:31 <p> MALEMA CALLS FOR " MERGER ' BETWEEN EFF AND ANC <p> I called this . I was ridiculed about this . Yet it was clear after the recent elections . <p> Malema is not stupid . Despite what the Media had said about the EFF 's Local Government Election performance , it was a wake-up call to any serious observer , and most definitely to the little megalomaniac . <p> The Media heaped lavish praise on him for his political brilliance after the elections , when in fact his back was against the wall . He had negotiated with the DA for power sharing and lost . The way the EFF voted in the mayoral elections was the only option they realistically had left . They had after all campaigned on an anti-ANC platform . If he had voted with the ANC , his supporters would not have accepted that . <p> Somehow , according to the press , that made him a genius . <p> He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EFF , and he knows it . The recent election and subsequent horsetrading confirmed it . Being the darling of the media , and wielding actual power are two separate matters entirely . <p> However , with Zuma gone , Malema would have a clear path to the Union Buildings , provided he promises the ANC the return of his youthful supporters . We all know Zuma will not survive 2019 politically , if indeed he lasts that long . That is a big stumbling block gone for Juju . <p> The thinking is probably along the lines of Malema returns his supporters , provides a majority in the 2019 General Election , becomes Secretary General , and then contests the presidency at the next election . <p> Some red berets will go along with him , sure , they would never even consider questioning their CIC . <p> But I think he has miscalculated here . I think Malema has made his first big political mistake . <p> There are enough EFF members who despise what the ANC has done , who were told to hate Ramaphosa by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mineworkers at Marikana . Malema 's EFF is fermenting the student violence . <p> Yet Malema is proposing love to the same ANC that has failed our education system so badly . <p> Now Malema wants to work with the party of Ramaphosa . Surely Malema , the revolutionary , is not getting into bed with the " capitalist killer of innocent mineworkers " ? ( the fact that there is little or no truth to that statement is of little or no consequence to your average red beret ) <p> The EFF 's honeymoon is over . Malema is already facing a revolt in KZN . Malema has disbanded all EFF structures in KZN and the Eastern Cape . They have faced problems in Gauteng due to alleged fraud , which caused another mini revolt . <p> When you plant your seeds in anarchy , be prepared to have an interesting harvest . <p> The problem Juju faces is that for the first time in recent memory , he blinked . <p> And with this one blink , his reputation has been diminished . His supporters will rightly feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the water , and the sharks will start circling . <p> His aura of fearlessness , and the carefully curated selfless image might dissolve when people realise how he has been playing everybody . It is this aura that drew crowds of 50 000 to hear him speak . Its this aura that make ANCYL members secretly admire him . <p> Now that is gone . <p> There will be no " merger " Malema will slink back to the ANC and the EFF will be absorbed . Back to business as usual . <p> But why now ? <p> There are few factors at play here . <p> Firstly , I think Malema was caught off guard by how little the massive crowds that he pulled pre-election , translated into actual votes cast . If that trend continues , the EFF will be in serious trouble of " COPE'ing " or going the way of the UDM . Juju has bigger ambitions than that . Ambitions that the EFF vehicle may not be able to deliver . Malema wants to be president , not a Holomisa-like figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Secondly , I think Malema underestimated how fast there would be real change in municipalities under DA leadership , and how positively it will be received by the people . <p> Rural areas will see change faster because its easier to solve those problems . In Modimolle the DA has provided water and boreholes in a few weeks , when communities have been waiting for years for the ANC to do nothing.The ANC 's last stronghold is the Rural Poor . <p> " The people " were told the DA is bringing back apartheid , but it turns out all they are bringing is services , water , deeds to homes . <p> This will not have gone unnoticed by Malema . <p> Should this trend continue , the ANC and EFF will both face a DA that has made good on its promises of removing corruption and a solid track record of delivering services to the poor . That is not a challenge that either of those two parties can afford . <p> Especially not if they are engaged in a fight against each other . Lets not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary voter by the EFF voting with them in the various mayoral elections . ( brilliant political move indeed ) <p> Lastly , we need to keep in mind that Malema has never answered the fraud charges brought against him and his accomplices in Limpopo . The case was withdrawn , not dismissed . The charges relating to the R52 Million On Point Engineering case can be brought before a court at any time . <p> We have seen what a determined person , with little or no scruples , can do to avoid facing such charges . It has been the backbone of Zuma 's rise to power . <p> Malema has seen it too . <p> Witnessing this unfolding saga is like watching the preview of a remake of a movie we never wanted to see in the first place . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

Instead , they were disgruntled , lazy students who most probably spent more time trying to be popular and activist wannabes instead of studying .
