<h> Didiza 's appointment ranks high in stupidity stakes <p> Sunday Independent / 26 Jun ' 16 , 10:09am <p> OPINION <p> The ANC 's decision on Thoko Didiza is so stupefying it leads me to suspect something fishy is going on , writes Xolela Mangcu . <p> Cape Town - United States president Barack Obama has a rule of thumb when it comes to political decision making : " Do n't do stupid . " He is of course not the first US president to leave us with a memorable phrase . <p> The ANC 's Tshwane mayoral candidate Thoko Didiza . Insisting on Didiza despite her unpopularity may satisfy the ego of the party leadership but it is also the surest way to seek defeat at the polls , says the writer . File pcture : Bruce Venter . Credit : INDEPENDENT MEDIA <p> Ted Sorensen crafted John F Kennedy 's now immortalised line : " Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " <p> Richard Nixon infamously declared he was not a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorbachev to " tear down that wall " . <p> His rather dour successor , George Herbert Walker Bush , boldly declared that Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait would " not stand " . He also urged Americans to " read my lips , no new taxes " , before proceeding to break that pledge and hand the presidency over to Bill Clinton . <p> Clinton was such a charmer that even the White House press gallery applauded his denial of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky : " I did not have a relationship with that woman , Ms Lewinsky . " <p> Notwithstanding his misadventures , Clinton inspired America to its longest economic growth in history with the slogan : " It 's the economy stupid . " <p> It is really hard to pick from the younger George Bush 's malapropisms . <p> The guy mistook himself for Jesus : " I trust God speaks through me . Without that I could n't do my job . " <p> President Obama 's turn of phrase has not been as uplifting as candidate Obama . As the saying goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To be sure , there is his unforgettable belting out of Amazing Grace during the funeral of the victims of the Charleston shooter , and his dropping of the mike at the White House correspondents ' dinner , to even greater applause than Clinton on Lewinsky ? <p> However , it is Obama 's " do n't do stupid " maxim that is relevant for South Africa right now . <p> The ANC 's appointment of Thoko Didiza as its mayoral candidate ranks up there in the stupidity stakes . <p> How could the party not anticipate the violence that came in its wake , especially in light of the violence that is wracking the party apart in other municipalities ? <p> Was there no intelligence - not just the human kind - that could have helped it predict such an outcome ? Or is there something about the word " local " in local leadership that the ANC does not understand ? <p> No , local does not mean mere residency or membership of a branch . Local means having deep-seated , organic roots to a community and involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in from national leadership . <p> If anything , this revolt reveals a profound distrust of the party 's national leadership . Max Weber would have called it a crisis of legitimate authority . <p> Weber divided authority into three types - charismatic , rational-legal and praebendal . Charismatic authority is embodied in the hero who leads his people out of bondage . <p> The biblical Moses is the ancient example and George Washington , Nelson Mandela and Julius Nyerere are modern examples . However , Weber also said this authority " exists only in origination " . <p> As soon as a political movement achieves victory , its leadership must quickly dissolve into rational-legal authority . Rules , laws and knowledge about matters of state substitute for charisma . <p> Unfortunately , rational-legal authority often finds it difficult to embed itself in society . Because of its bureaucratic and technocratic orientation , it soon substitutes itself for the people . It turns democratic authorisation into self-authorisation . <p> As Thabo Mbeki rudely learned , when a leader substitutes himself for the people , he invites rebellion . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , a new charismatic leader can emerge to establish a new legitimate authority . On the other hand , this charismatic leader can eschew seeking institutional legitimacy and set himself up as the patriarch of the nation . <p> A classic feature of this type of authority is the failure to distinguish between private and public property . Weber might as well have had Nkandla in mind when he described his third type of authority - praebendal authority . <p> This is what people are rebelling against . It is truly sad to listen to ANC leaders mimicking the National Party of yore by telling us the violence is the work of criminals . The last time I heard such gobbledygook was in PW Botha 's time . Maybe it is true that the Gods do indeed make crazy those they seek to destroy . <p> If Herr Motsoeneng is capable of learning anything from the Tshwane violence it should be that you can ban footage and live in your own Cloud Cuckoo-land but you can not ban social reality . <p> The ANC 's decision on Didiza is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , even though I ca n't put my finger on it . Could the Guptas be involved ? <p> You just never know these days . This being South Africa , something will emerge , sooner or later . <p> Insisting on Didiza despite her unpopularity may satisfy the ego of the party leadership but it is also the surest way to seek defeat at the polls , at the hands of its own disgruntled voters . In football , this is called scoring an own goal . <p> There is also the big elephant in the room - ethnicity . <p> I make bold to say that denying the reality of ethnicity is as stupid as denying the reality of race in South Africa . It is an exercise in what the distinguished philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah called hard rationalism . <p> This is the dogmatic insistence , shared by many liberals and Marxists alike , that social identities do not have any validity because they are not scientific . <p> They argue these identities are constructed out of false consciousness . Even if that were the case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their false consciousness before you can act on the world . <p> The last time someone tried that , Stalin left 20 million people dead . Against this dogmatism I would offer the wise counsel of pragmatic philosopher , William James : " There is always the pinch between the ideal and the actual , which can only be got through by leaving part of the ideal behind . There is hardly a good which we can imagine except as competing for the possession of the same bit of space and time with some other imagined good . " <p> The way out of such dilemmas comes from what Sydney Hook , another pragmatic philosopher , called conscientiousness , or " reflexive inquiry into the features of a situation " . <p> Sometimes we will recognise identities and sometimes we will realise we are much more than our ontologies . Let identity recognition and identity transcendence share " the same bit of space and time . " We have social identities but we are much more than them . <p> The metaphor of the rainbow nation should apply to ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such thing as a colourless rainbow . <p> But we know that the rainbow is more than an arrangement of colours , it has a transcendent identity . When it appears we do n't stop to say : " Look , colours on the sky . " We say , in wonderment : " Look , there 's a rainbow !
