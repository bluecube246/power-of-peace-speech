On what amounted to a near perfect day for the home side Faf du Plessis led from the front with his fifth Test century and his second against New Zealand ( 112 not out , 232 balls , 12 fours and 2 sixes ) to set up the third highest first innings Test score at this venue of 481/8 declared before Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander got rid of the New Zealand opening pair as quickly as they had done in the previous match at Sahara Stadium Kingsmead .  Temba Bavuma then chimed in with the brilliant run out of Ross Taylor from his specialist short leg position to leave New Zealand on 38/3 at the close and still 443 runs in arrears .  The visiting captain , Kane Williamson , will have to match the performance of his opposing captain when play Plessis and JP Duminy ( 88 off 158 balls , 13 fours ) were the two leading runs scorers for South Africa in a match in which the top five all past the half-century mark is highly encouraging looking ahead not only to the remainder of this match but the forthcoming series in Australia as well . Having the entire top order in good form is the basic requirement for any successful Test side .  The foundation that had been laid on day one became all the more evident as New Zealand opted for a containing policy on the second day with a measure of success as they restricted the Proteas to 75/2 in the morning session and 79/1 in the afternoon .  In spite of the containing nature of their bowling Neil Wagner put in another wonderful effort and fully deserved his five-wicket haul -- 5/86 in 39 overs -- to get his name on to the honours ' board at his original home ground .  The four New Zealand seamers all bowled more than 30 overs as the spin of Mitchell Santner was again only frugally had bowled on day one .  When New Zealand batted , Steyn and Philander were as impressive as they had been at Kingsmead . By the time the total had reached 18/2 only one scoring stroke had been made in front of the wicket .  Kagiso Rabada bowled at express pace , topping out at 148km/h compared to the 146 of Steyn and life is not going to get any easier for the batsmen on a pitch of increasingly variable bounce .
