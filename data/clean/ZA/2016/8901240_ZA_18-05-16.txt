<h> Ex-DRC warlord to get 25 years <p> The Hague - War crimes prosecutors on Wednesday called for former Congolese vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba to be sentenced " to at least 25 years " in prison for a slew of rapes and murders in the Central African Republic over a decade ago . <p> Bemba sat stony-faced at the end of three days of hearings at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , as prosecution lawyers rejected his defence team 's calls for a lesser jail term . <p> " The sentence recommended by the prosecution ... should not be less than 25 years of imprisonment , " chief ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told the court in The Hague . <p> Such a sentence would be justified by " the gravity of the offences committed by M. Bemba and his degree of culpability . " <p> After a lengthy trial which opened in November 2010 , the judges in March found Bemba guilty of five charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity . <p> The three judges agreed with the prosecution that Bemba had retained " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Central African Republic CAR to quell an attempted coup against the then president . <p> His Congolese Liberation Movement ( MLC ) carried out a brutal series of rapes and murders in a campaign of terror , which experts testified would have long-term traumatic effects on the CAR people for generations . <p> Bemba 's defence team had called for a jail term not exceeding 12 to 14 years . <p> But another prosecutor , Jean-Jacques Badibanga , said such a sentence would have the " absurd consequences " of seeing a more lenient term applied by the ICC then in national courts trying people for murder and rape . <p> The judges will hand down their sentence at a later date . <p> The crimes in the CAR between October 2002 and March 2003 had been committed against " particularly defenceless victims " and " with particular cruelty , " the prosecutor told the court . <p> There " were no mitigating circumstances " which would allow the sentence to be reduced , he argued . <p> After the CAR conflict , Bemba , a wealthy **26;90;TOOLONG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's transitional government . <p> In 2006 , he lost to Kabila in a presidential run-off . He fled the next year into what he called " forced exile " in Europe and was arrested in Brussels in 2008 and handed over to the ICC .
