the top-seeded anderson , who went 14-for-14 on first-serve points in the opening set , never faced break point and fired 18 aces to win consecutive atp world tour matches for the first time in 2016 .  according to the official atp world tour website , anderson improved to 2-2 in head-to-head meetings against the spaniard and has only lost to the left-hander on clay .  the win is just anderson 's fifth of the season however as the 2.03m giant has struggled with left knee and right elbow injuries .  in october last year he reached a career-high of no 10 in the atp rankings . but the 30-year-old has since fallen to no 24 and was forced to retire from two matches and withdraw altogether from seven tournaments .  the nottingham open is the players ' last chance to hone their grass-court game before wimbledon starts next monday .  featured  as the absa premiership nears the christmas break , a little over half the season remains . who will be crowned champions when all is said and done ? to find out !
