<p> The top-seeded Anderson , who went 14-for-14 on first-serve points in the opening set , never faced break point and fired 18 aces to win consecutive ATP World Tour matches for the first time in 2016 . <p> According to the official ATP World Tour website , Anderson improved to 2-2 in head-to-head meetings against the Spaniard and has only lost to the left-hander on clay . <p> The win is just Anderson 's fifth of the season however as the 2.03m giant has struggled with left knee and right elbow injuries . <p> In October last year he reached a career-high of No 10 in the ATP Rankings . But the 30-year-old has since fallen to No 24 and was forced to retire from two matches and withdraw altogether from seven tournaments . <p> The Nottingham Open is the players ' last chance to hone their grass-court game before Wimbledon starts next Monday . <h> Featured <p> As the Absa Premiership nears the Christmas break , a little over half the season remains . Who will be crowned champions when all is said and done ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out !
