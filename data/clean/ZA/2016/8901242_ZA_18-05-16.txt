Tags :  Graduates in health sciences are not keen to work in under-served and rural areas . Some of them opt to leave the country and work overseas instead of doing their community service in South Africa due to better remuneration in other countries .  Health graduates have a legal obligation to do a year of community service in South Africa after graduation . However , according to the findings of a study conducted by the social-profit organisation , Africa Health Placements , many graduates fail to do so .  One of the researchers involved in the study , Professor Steve Reid , from the University of Cape Town , says regulations are needed to attract community health workers .  " You can induce health workers to work in underserved areas through educating them , through providing them , through providing regulatory mechanisms such as compulsory community service . "  Reid says , " You can pay them financially and you can provide professional personal support once they are out there to keep them there . In African countries financial incentives are that change . "
