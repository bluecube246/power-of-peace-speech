tags :  graduates in health sciences are not keen to work in under-served and rural areas . some of them opt to leave the country and work overseas instead of doing their community service in south africa due to better remuneration in other countries .  health graduates have a legal obligation to do a year of community service in south africa after graduation . however , according to the findings of a study conducted by the social-profit organisation , africa health placements , many graduates fail to do so .  one of the researchers involved in the study , professor steve reid , from the university of cape town , says regulations are needed to attract community health workers .  " you can induce health workers to work in underserved areas through educating them , through providing them , through providing regulatory mechanisms such as compulsory community service . "  reid says , " you can pay them financially and you can provide professional personal support once they are out there to keep them there . in african countries financial incentives are that change .
