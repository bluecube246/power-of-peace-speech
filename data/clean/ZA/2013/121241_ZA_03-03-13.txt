hafeez was the game changer -- faf  centurion -- mohammad hafeez was the game changer for pakistan , said losing skipper faf du plessis after south africa suffered their worst defeat in twenty20 cricket on sunday .  " the shorter the format , the bigger the chance that one person can change the game and hafeez changed the game today , " du plessis said after pakistan beat south africa by 95 runs .  with the first match rained out in durban on friday night , pakistan took the series 1-0 courtesy of hafeez , who tore apart the south african attack .  " we gave hafeez too many options and he was scoring both sides of the wicket , " said du plessis .  " it was only in the 15th or 16th over , we bowled much better and managed to restrict them and get some wickets at the end . so that 's one positive we can take from the game . "  after a dismal test series , hafeez played an outstanding knock for his 86 off fours and four sixes , came to an unfortunate end when his back foot slid onto his stumps and dislodged the bails .  pakistan started with intent and had the run rate at over nine runs an over from the seventh over .  " we can learn from them the way they played the first eight overs , " du plessis said .  " they put the pressure on our bowlers and made the rest of the game much easier for themselves . "  having beaten pakistan 3-0 in the test series , on wickets suited to the south african seam attack , it was a different matter in the t20 .  " when it comes to playing on a wicket like this one -- which was very close to being a road -- their skills are better than ours and that 's another area where we want to learn from them . "  pakistan 's opening pair of nasir jamshed and ahmed shehzad set the pace with the latter smacking two sixes before he was run out on 46 .  he faced 25 brought hafeez to the crease but it had no effect on the team 's momentum .  hafeez reached his half-century off 30 balls and achieved his highest t20 score -- his previous being 71 against zimbabwe , in harare .  du plessis had to call on his ' death ' bowlers midway through the innings and said the only advice he gave his bowlers was not to panic .  " we 're building towards the next t20 world cup so if it means experimenting with inexperienced players , then so be it .  " when pakistan are on fire like they were today , they can put the best in the world under pressure and it was a learning curve for our young guys . "  chasing 196 , south africa opened their innings with ab de villiers and henry davids and tried to replicate the fast start made by the opposition .  " it 's the one thing that worked for us today . we know what ab can do in the middle order , so it was just a case of trying him attack . "  de villiers scored 36 off 22 balls , hitting four boundaries and two sixes , until he was castled by mohammad irfan .  kleinveldt was the only other south african batsman to make a start as umar gul took five wickets for six runs off 2.2 overs . and , after his masterful batting , hafeez took three for 25 with the ball .  " it was a great feeling to walk into a happy dressing-room , " said hafeez after the match .  " i 've missed it for the last 42 days and i just hope we can keep up this good feeling for the one-day series .  he said during the test series , he always felt he was batting well in the nets , but got out to some good balls .  " i have to thank the coaches , who always remained positive and lifted my morale . i always try and go out there and express myself and today i took my chances because the pressure is on the bowlers in the t20 format .
