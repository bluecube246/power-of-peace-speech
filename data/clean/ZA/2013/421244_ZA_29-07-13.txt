Picture:SANDILE MAKHOBA <p> Durban - The man who shot dead a Grade 11 pupil he suspected of being his teacher wife 's lover , has been sentenced to an effective 10 years in prison . This was after pleading guilty to the murder of 20-year-old Sipheshile Kheswa , and the attempted murder of his wife , Bongiwe Thusi . <p> Appearing in the Durban Magistrate 's Court on Friday , Simon Thusi , 45 , was sentenced to 10 years for murder and five for attempted murder , to be served concurrently . <p> In a statement read by his legal aid lawyer , the court heard that Thusi had last year " shot randomly " after confronting Kheswa , who he found " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sex " . <p> When his wife tried to stop him by grabbing him with both arms , he shot at her too , wounding her in both legs . <p> Thusi , who worked in Port Shepstone as a teacher and only returned to his Doonside family home on weekends , had been booked off sick on September 4 last year . <p> " I found the house locked and sat under a tree to wait for my wife . " He said his wife came to drop off their two children , aged three and 12 , then drove off , returning four hours later with Kheswa who was a pupil at Hlengiwe High , where his wife taught . <p> " I went inside and asked him what he was doing in my house . He said this was his girlfriend 's house , I was so angry and shocked , " said Thusi . It was then that he pulled out his firearm , which he had bought while working in the taxi industry , and fired . " The children came in and asked why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house . " <p> Bobbi Bear child safety officer , Ladyfair Sibiya , who was called in to assist the children on the day of the incident , said they had been deeply traumatised . " We have put them through counselling , but they are not coping at all . " <p> State prosecutor Calvin Govender said Thusi 's lack of self-control had not only cost a life but had also left his children psychologically scarred . <p> Although he said he did not doubt Thusi 's remorse , being a teacher , he had set a bad example . " Is this what we want our children to look up to ? He could not control himself and killed . The interests of justice outweigh his personal circumstances , " said Govender . <p> Delivering the judgment , magistrate Farida Mohamed said Thusi had positioned himself so he could observe what was happening without being seen then , upon realising the two were having an affair , chose to shoot rather than calming himself and attempting to resolve the matter . <p> She called his action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was provoked by circumstances beyond his control . <p> Thusi 's wife of seven years sat with her arms folded at the back of the court . <p> Speaking to the Daily News after court had adjourned David Daniels , the deceased 's cousin , said he was relieved Thusi had been found guilty but he was not happy with the sentence , calling for life instead . " I hate what he did . We would have been the first in our entire family to matriculate , " he said . <p> Crying as he spoke , Daniels said it had been his idea for Siphesihle to move from Flagstaff in the Eastern Cape to Durban to continue his education . " We were both in the same grade at the same school . I had seen him during break and we had talked about what we should do for my birthday - only for him to die on that day . " <p> Thusi was last year fired by the Education Department , spokesman , Muzi Mahlambi , confirmed . <p> Daily News <p> * If you use Gmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling out a new tabbed inbox that filters your mail into 5 separate tabs - Primary , Social , Promotions , Updates and Forums .
