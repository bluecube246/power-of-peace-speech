" We have obtained support from the government so there are no obstacles , " said Syafril Nasution , corporate affairs director for RCTI , the organizer and official broadcaster of the event .  " Since the beginning , we have made it clear that the event will not feature bikinis , or make use of anything that is against religious and cultural values , " he said . " So we do n't really understand why there are still objections . "  Amidhan Sabrah , chairman of the Indonesian Council of Ulema , said it was opposed to the event because it objectified women .  " This kind of events turn women into a commodity and that is against Islam , " he said . " Maybe in the West it 's not a problem , but it should not part  But Sabrah conceded that the council was not a religious police .  " We have the right to object , " he said . " Whether the event will go ahead or not it 's up to the government . "  The semi-official council consists of religious scholars representing the country 's various Islamic organizations .  The pageant is scheduled for 28 September in Sentul , on the outskirts of Jakarta .  Last year , authorities in Jakarta refused to issue a concert permit for eccentric American pop diva Lady Gaga following protests by hardline Muslim groups that said her stage act was pornographic .  About 88 per cent of Indonesia 's 238 million people adhere to the Islamic faith , making it the world 's largest Muslim-majority country .  Most Indonesian Muslims are moderate , but vocal hardline groups have been increasingly bold in pushing their agenda in recent years .  24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our Comments Policy .
