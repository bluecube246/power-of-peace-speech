Freecom Mobile SQ portable hard drive review
http://mybroadband.co.za/news/reviews/70560-freecom-mobile-sq-portable-hard-drive-review.html

those shopping for external drives are usually looking for four things -- design , capacity , performance , and value for money . out of the box it looks like the freecom mobile sq 500gb hard drive has the first two covered , but is this the full package ? let 's have a closer look .  freecom mobile sq design and build quality  the mobile sq sports a very lightweight design -- it has a rounded square shape , fits in your hand and is only a little over a centimetre in thickness . this makes it extremely portable and easy to slip into a laptop bag or backpack -- not bad for 500gb of storage .  the top and bottom are both done in a sandblasted stainless steel , with a textured black plastic along the sides . there 's a single usb 3.0 port on the back , and four flat rubber feet on the bottom . the feet were a nice touch which prevented the drive from slipping around , without adding much height to it .  overall it feels very sturdy and solid . a lot of mobile drives you see are done in glossy colours or with striking accents , but the mobile sq manages a much more understated look that makes it look a lot less like a running shoe than its competition . the toned-down looks and rubber feet make it great for a media device to plug in to your television , where it should fit in quite nicely .  my only complaint is the bundled cable , which is very short -- under a metre .  freecom mobile sq  freecom mobile sq features  the main selling point of this drive is how compact it is ; it 's one of the smaller drives you 'll find at this kind of capacity , impressive considering the mobile sq is also available with 1tb of storage . the 1tb is admittedly a little thicker , but not by much .  those wanting security features are going to be disappointed -- the drive does n't come with password protection or any other kind of security , so you 'll want to keep  one thing freecom have included is a nifty power-saving function that puts the drive into standby when it 's finished copying . it 's not a major selling point , but it 's neat if you want to leave something large to copy while you 're out the house or office .  the drive is both mac and windows compliant , and comes with a bit of pre-loaded software for windows users in the form of nero 's back it up and burn . the software allows you to back up data to the drive as well as format it to your own specifications . unfortunately , mac users are stuck with their own os tools to do the same job .  freecom mobile sq  freecom mobile sq performance  the freecom mobile sq performed reasonably in read and write tests , boasting read times of around 104-109 mb/s and write times just below that at 102-107 mb/s . this is of course using the drive 's usb 3.0 capabilities ; in a usb 2.0 port you 're going to get a tenth of that . it going to get speeds quite a lot lower , around 35-40 mb/s , but this is normal and nothing to worry about .  these performance figures are about what you 'd expect ; you would n't want to see numbers much lower than this . there are faster drives out there , but the difference is n't any cause for major concern .  freecom mobile sq  freecom mobile sq conclusion  at an rrp of r999 for the 500gb version , the freecom mobile sq is n't what you 'd call cheap . if all you want is 500gb of storage at usb 3.0 speeds , you could get that for as little as r750 .  however , what you are paying for here is the design -- you 'd be hard pressed to find a 500gb drive as compact and elegant as this . it 'll fit in great with your media setup at home , and for a lot of people that will be worth the couple of hundred rands extra .
