us and allies preparing for probable strike on syria  reuters  reuters  world  28 aug 2013 01:26 ( south africa )  the united states and its allies were gearing up on tuesday for a probable military strike against syria that could happen within days as punishment for last week 's chemical weapons attacks blamed on president bashar al-assad 's government . by khaled yacoub oweis and william maclean .  western powers have told the syrian opposition to expect military action against assad 's forces soon , according to sources who attended a meeting between envoys and the syrian national coalition in istanbul .  amid a quickening drumbeat of preparations , u.s. defence secretary chuck hagel said american forces in the region were " ready to go " if president barack obama gives the order , as intelligence agencies assembled what is sure to be final confirmation of the syrian government 's culpability for wednesday 's poison gas attack near damascus .  white house spokesman jay carney said it would " fanciful " to think that anyone other than syrian president , which killed hundreds of people as they slept .  obama has yet to make a final decision on the u.s. response , carney said , but left little doubt that it would involve military action . he insisted , however , that washington was not intent on " regime change , " signalling that any military strikes would be limited and not meant to topple assad .  the british military was also drafting plans . prime minister david cameron , anxious , like obama , not to emulate the entanglements in wars in afghanistan and iraqi that beset their predecessors , said any strikes would be " specific " so as not to drag the allies deeper into the syrian civil war now in its third year .  cameron recalled parliament for a debate on syria on thursday .  u. n. chemical weapons investigators put off until wednesday a second trip to the rebel-held suburbs of damascus , where activists say hundreds of civilians died a week ago .  while evidence of chemical warfare could bolster an argument for intervention at the united nations in leaders and the arab league have already declared assad guilty .  ahmad jarba , president of the rebel syrian national coalition , met envoys from 11 countries at an istanbul hotel , including the u.s. ambassador to syria , robert ford . the rebel leaders proposed targets for cruise missiles and bombing .  one participant said : " the opposition was told in clear terms that action to deter further use of chemical weapons by the assad regime could come as early as in the next few days . "  planning appears to focus on missile or air strikes . there is little public support in western countries for troops to invade syria .  " we have moved assets in place to be able to fulfil and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take , " hagel said .  the precise timing of possible military action remained unclear , but it is certain to wait for an official u.s. intelligence report blaming assad 's government for the chemical attack . the findings , considered merely a formality at this point , will be released pressure for u.s. action on syria obama is expected to keep close watch on the situation there , but he will go ahead with a speech on wednesday at washington 's lincoln memorial marking the 50th anniversary of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr . ' s " i have a dream speech . "  mood in damascus  syria 's government , backed by iran , denies gassing its own people and has vowed to defend itself , but residents of damascus are growing anxious .  " i 've always been a supporter of foreign intervention , but now that it seems like a reality , i 've been worrying that my family could be hurt or killed , " said a woman named zaina , who opposes assad . " i 'm afraid of a military strike now . "  " the big fear is that they 'll make the same mistakes they made in libya and iraq , " said ziyad , a man in his 50s . " they 'll hit civilian targets and then they 'll cry that it was by . "  russia , assad 's main arms supplier , opposes military action and has suggested that rebel forces may have released the poison gas . china 's state news agency recalled how flawed intelligence was used to justify the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .  firm opposition from permanent members of the u.n . security council all but rules out a u.n . mandate of the kind that gave legal backing to nato air strikes that helped libyan rebels unseat muammar gaddafi two years ago . however , western officials say they do want to act within international law .  moscow and beijing accuse western powers of using human rights complaints , such as in libya , to meddle in sovereign states ' affairs . white house spokesman carney insisted : " the options that we are considering are not about regime change .  " they are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons . " although obama has long said assad should step down , he is unwilling to commit to making that happen the interests of the united states " to respond to the chemical weapons attack .  in britain , cameron told reporters : " this is not about getting involved in a middle eastern war or changing our stance in syria or going further into that conflict . it 's about chemical weapons . their use is wrong and the world should n't stand idly by . "  in france , which played a major role in libya , president francois hollande said he was " ready to punish " assad for using the chemical weapons , citing a 2005 u.n . provision for international action to protect civilians from their own governments .  similar arguments were used by nato to bomb serbia , a russian ally , after the killing of civilians in kosovo .  in an indication of support from arab states that may help western powers argue the case for an attack against likely u.n . vetoes from moscow and beijing , the arab league issued a statement holding assad 's government responsible for the chemical attack .  fears of another international conflict in a six-month high and stocks fell around the world , notably in turkey , as well as in emerging economies that would suffer from a chill in trade .  the government of turkey , a nato member , called for action against assad for what it called a " crime against humanity . "  tough choices  obama , cameron and hollande face questions at home about how a military intervention would end , whether they risk bolstering assad if he rides out the assault and whether they risk handing power to anti-western islamist rebels if assad were overthrown .  turmoil in egypt , where the 2011 uprising inspired syrians to rebel , has underlined the unpredictability of revolutions . the presence of islamist militants , including allies of al qaeda in the syrian rebel ranks , has given western leaders pause . they have held back so far from helping assad 's opponents to victory .  syrian foreign minister walid al-moualem said u.s. strikes would help al qaeda and called western leaders " delusional " if they hoped to help the rebels reach a balance of defending ourselves , and we will surprise them with these if necessary , " he said . " we will defend ourselves . we will not hesitate to use any means available . "  assad 's forces made little or no response to three attacks by israeli aircraft earlier this year that israeli officials said disrupted arms flowing from iran to lebanon 's hezbollah .  the presence of united nations experts in damascus may be a factor holding back international military action . the experts came under fire in government-held territory on monday before reaching the rebel lines . they interviewed and took samples from survivors , though much evidence may have decayed .  opposition activists have said at least 500 people , and possibly twice that many , were killed by rockets carrying the nerve gas sarin or something similar . if so , it was the worst chemical weapons attack since saddam hussein gassed thousands of iraqi kurds in 1988 . dm  photo : the guided-missile destroyer uss ramage is seen operating in the arabian gulf in this handout picture taken on november 15 , deployed in the mediterranean sea equipped with long-range tomahawk missles that could potentially be used to strike syria , according to officials . reuters/specialist 2nd class miguel angel contreras/u.s . navy/handout  cop21 and south africa 's impending coal cliff  cricket : england tour a big income boost for south africa  by reuters  sa vs england test series preview : five key battles  by antoinette muller  comments  our policy dictates first names and surnames must be used to comment on articles . failure to do so will see them removed . we also reserve the right to delete comments deemed lewd , racist or just generally not contributing to intelligent debate that have been flagged by other readers . as a general rule of thumb , just avoid being a douchebag and you 'll be ok , both on these pages and in life . read the full policy here
