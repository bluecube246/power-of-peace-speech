Numsa KZN will not protest e-tolls  Durban - The National Union of Metalworkers of SA ( Numsa ) in KwaZulu-Natal has broken ranks with other Cosatu affiliates , declaring it would not be taking part in Tuesday 's nationwide protests against e-tolling and labour brokers .  Further to that , Numsa KZN also called for the resignation of Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini , whom it accused of failing to unite the trade union federation and of also being part of the faction that is trying to delay a Cosatu special congress , which has been requested by some affiliates .  Numsa and other affiliates requested the special congress in September to deal with , among other things , the fate of suspended Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi .  Responding to these allegations on Sunday , Dlamini accused the Numsa KZN leadership of being " regionalists " .  " The thinking by these people is that because the president of Cosatu comes from KZN , then their struggle ( to remove Dlamini ) would be much more effective if this call is championed no other region of Numsa has made such a call . "  Dlamini also lambasted the KZN regional secretary of Numsa , Mbuso Ngubane , saying he had no business pronouncing on Cosatu leadership matters " because he is not a worker but an employee of Numsa who is supposed to be servicing the workers " .  Ngubane had accused Dlamini of trying to delay the special congress of Cosatu by allegedly claiming that there was no money to hold it .  Ngubane said this was an invalid excuse as accommodation and transport costs for delegates to Cosatu congresses were paid for by affiliates .  " Cosatu only has to pay for the venue and lunch for delegates . We are not even talking about a four-day congress here , but only a two-day congress , " said Basil Cele , the chairman of Numsa in KZN .  Dlamini , however , said after the request for the special congress was made , he wrote to the different Cosatu affiliates asking for clarity on some matters .  " Up until today not even a single Numsa should consult with their national leadership on that matter . "  Dlamini had wanted to get the proposed agenda for the meeting and some reports from the affiliates that would feed into the organisational report .  He said he was not reluctant to convene the special congress .  " I want a united Cosatu because a divided Cosatu would not do the workers any good because it would mean that the shield of the workers that is Cosatu has been removed . "  Meanwhile , Dlamini said the stayaway would go ahead tomorrow as there was a " groundswell of support " from Cosatu affiliates . " Even at the KZN shop stewards council Numsa stood up and through its regional chairman , Basil Cele , expressed support for the action . Why are they now singing a different tune . "  But Cele said his branch had decided against participating in the protests , saying there was very little time to mobilise .  He said the issue first came up at the provincial shop stewards ' council on November 3 . After consultation would be impossible to mobilise successfully .
