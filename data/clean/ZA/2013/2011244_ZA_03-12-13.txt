<h> Desperate dreams of Cape 's matrics <p> School 's out for summer -- school 's out forever . But what 's next ? This is the predicament facing 48 000 Western Cape matrics as they celebrate the end of their schooling and await their results on January 7 . The Cape Argus asked 300 matrics in Manenberg and Khayelitsha about their dreams -- and what was stopping them from coming true <p> Cape Town - Bursting out of school halls after writing their last big exam , most matrics could only think of that night 's party . But those who pause to think about the future have big dreams , plenty of hope , and a desperate desire to improve their lot . <p> However , their plans are about to come up against twin challenges : universities in the Western Cape can only accept 21 percent of applications , and the job market is extremely tough . <p> Most matrics -- 68 percent -- want to study further next year . But many have not applied to university , or may not achieve a university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs after matric . <p> According to Stats SA , 7 million South Africans who want jobs can not find them . More than half of them are between 15 and 24 . <p> The job market may have very little space for matriculants , but this has n't dimmed their great hopes . They will have a mountain to climb -- and no one is better equipped to climb mountains than Konwaba Nkone . <p> Nkone , 19 , lives with his grandmother in Khayelitsha and has just finished matric at Masiyile High . He has applied to study sports management at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology ( CPUT ) -- as a stepping stone to a career doing what he loves : mountain climbing . <p> Nkone escapes to the mountain as often as he can . " When you grow up in the township , you do n't get space to think about yourself . You are always disturbed . When I 'm in the mountains I get the time to listen to myself , to get to know myself . " <p> His grandmother , Thelma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of Khayelitsha . " My soul is relieved , because I 'm always worrying . When somebody comes and takes him up to the mountain he is safe . " <p> Nkone hikes with 15 other boys from the township . They call themselves Desert Rose , because they are trying to grow up beautiful in a barren place . <p> Last week , they climbed Table Mountain , stayed overnight in one of the mountain huts , then hiked down through Kirstenbosch . Conquering the mountain made Nkone feel unstoppable . <p> " I feel I 'm going to pass matric . I feel there 's nothing I ca n't do . " <p> Despite the many things Nkone dislikes about Khayelitsha , it 's where he wants to live once he 's a successful sports manager and mountain climber . " I do n't want to run away . I want to stay here so people can see this guy has made it . I want to be a role model . " <p> He hopes that when they see his success , they will believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys end up doing bad things here , " he says . " They spend days sitting on the corner gaining nothing . <p> " They must stick to school . They must be strong and not give up . Then they will live a great life . Then they can get out of the township . " <p> A gap year appeals to matriculants who just want to earn some money , but is a bad idea in the long run , says Nkone . " You 're going to get a job at Shoprite , earn some money and forget about your career . Then later you have kids , and see that it 's not real money . " <p> Nkone is in it for the long run . <p> " I 'm going to climb Kilimanjaro , " he says . " Nothing that can stop me . " <p> Sesethu Rawe , a fellow pupil at Masiyile High , wants to be the first person in her family to go to university . " Getting matric is not enough for me , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted to apply to CPUT , but only got as far as filling in the forms . She had only R50 of the R150 application fee , and could n't submit the paperwork . <p> Without acceptance to a university , Rawe does n't know what she will do . <p> " I 'm blank . I do n't have any plans , " she says . " My mom does n't want me to work because she says I wo n't go back to school . " <p> Rawe 's mother is in the Eastern Cape , while she lives with her uncle in Mfuleni . <p> " I would not be happy staying here , " she says . Just attending class was a battle some days , as she would not be able to pay the taxi fare to school in Khayelitsha . <p> Rawe 's mother wants her to be a teacher , but her heart is set on being a lawyer and living in Sandton . " I like to solve other people 's problems , and I 'm a good adviser . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at a loss about future study . Some got unskilled jobs to earn some money . Then they never study further . <p> " Money is the root of all evil , " she says . " They want to get jobs because their family ca n't support them . They finish matric and they think they are done . But the job is not good , and it 's not permanent . Then when you 've had a job it 's hard to go back to school . " <p> Rawe is anxious about her results . She failed her June exams , but improved in September . She studied with two classmates : they helped her with maths while she taught them to do summaries for the language papers . <p> " I worked hard . " <p> According to the Cape Argus survey , business was by far the favourite job category selected by matrics imagining their ideal life in 10 years . Social work was next , followed by accounting , natural and physical sciences , and hospitality . <p> Unskilled jobs were selected by 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , join the army or work for the city council . <p> Most matrics want families , but they do n't want to raise them in the same place they grew up . A staggering majority want to move away and better their living conditions . <p> Out of 108 responses from matrics at school in Manenberg , 22 wanted to live " anywhere but Manenberg " or " anywhere outside the townships " . <p> Eighty percent believe they will achieve their dreams , and 5 percent do n't think they will ever have the job or house they want . They say the biggest barrier between them and their dreams is money . <p> Western Cape Education MEC Donald Grant says he is confident school has prepared pupils for the next stage of their lives . <p> " The fact is , their future is now in their hands and they must grasp the opportunities that come their way . This next phase in their lives may seem daunting . However , without even knowing it they have been equipping themselves over the past 12 years , bit by @ @ @
