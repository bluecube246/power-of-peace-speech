Google Chromecast hacked : here 's how  People will hack anything , especially if it 's a US$35 media streamer called Chromecast . No-one 's ever happy with what they 've got , which partly explains the success of the iPhone , still -- what to with a hacked Chromecast ? Before we explain , there 's something you should know : most of you will get very little joy out of the Google Chromecast hack : it 's aimed at developers looking to create and run custom software on the HDMI wunder-dongle . But this is step one as hack creators GTV say . With this tool , the smartest of us will be able to get inside the inner workings of this very new and very mysterious . First off , here 's proof of concept , presented below in this awfully quiet video :  Secondly , here 's what we know about Chromecast so far . It 's not ChromeOS , it 's a " modified " version of Google TV , with most of the juicy parts stripped down to the APK ) is impossible , the bootloader , kernel , init scripts and binaries of Google TV are all front and present .  A flaw in logic  Chromecast has some exploitable bugs and by holding down the single button on the device , GTV 's unsigned kernal will replace the official system files with the rooted ones . Once all is said and done , you can telnet to the root shell of Chromecast on port 23 . It 's less complicated than it sounds , and all you need is a USB cable , Chromecast and a memory stick . Onto the hack , as detailed by GTV 's wiki page .  Items Needed :  Blank USB Flash drive ( at least 128MB ) -- Your drive will be erased --  Our USB Image  Google Chromecast  Powered Micro USB OTG Cable  If not a Powered Micro USB OTG Cable , then find a way to rig up a cable that does just this . We will not provide instructions , it 's simple , but still . Just buy the cable . " gtvhacker-chromecast.bin " file .  Install our USB image as a whole to your USB flash drive with dd :  Syntax : dd **27;115;TOOLONG of=/dev/sdX bs=1024  Root Process :  Plug the flash drive into one female " A " end of the USB OTG cable  Plug the other end into the Chromecast  Hold down the button on the Chromecast while plugging in the power cord .  Watch the screen , and any blinking light on your flash drive . The Chromecast will power up , execute our unsigned kernel , kick off to a script that replaces /system with a rooted one . It will then wipe /data , and reboot back to the normal system . All of this should take about a minute . Do n't unplug anything while it is installing .  When it is complete , your box will reboot , and you will see a new splash screen , and then the Setup screen . Just re-set up your Chromecast , and you can telnet to get a root shell on your Chromecast on port 23 !  . GTV also notes that at " any time " an update could be pushed through that negates their hack . Good luck , and get creative .
