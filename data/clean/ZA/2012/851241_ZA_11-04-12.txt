menace of cyber bullies  april 11 2012 at 11:45am  the ever-increasing trend of cyberbullying almost ended in the death of a durban teenager who tried to commit suicide after her name was put on a so-called " sluts list " that went viral on facebook and blackberry messenger .  she found her name was on the list last month , and tried to overdose by drinking a cocktail of household detergents and petrol . the girl recovered in hospital and was discharged four days later .  this is yet another example of cyberbullying in schools .  in january a 15-year-old gauteng schoolgirl was harassed by four fellow pupils .  it is alleged they mocked her , called her fat and threw diet pills at her . they then went on to facebook and blackberry 's bbm chat service , making a series of threats and nasty comments .  and if that was not enough , they allegedly hit her over the head with a glass bottle . the assault was filmed by another pupil , allegedly at the attacker 's back at school a week later .  the mother of the victim , who may not be named , filed a complaint of assault with the police . she said she was angry because the school had not told her the alleged attacker would be back at school .  she said her daughter had been friends with the group , but they had drifted apart -- and that 's when the cyberbullying began .  in the durban incident , the list was started earlier this year by an anonymous person who , using the bbm service , gave the names and details of 10 teenage girls from wentworth .  as the list went viral and was passed from one user to the next , more names were added to it .  " they need to go to their nearest police station where they must open a case of crimen injuria . we have not received any reports , but if we do we will investigate , " he said .  commenting on the gauteng incident , izabella little-gates , an internationally published author and parenting that is escalating and should be taken seriously .  " it has to be addressed , and parents must discuss it with their children . "  in the weeks following the incident , psychologists and experts said cyberbullying was under-reported and the country would see more cases as access to technology increased .  a study on cyber aggression was carried out among young people in four provinces by the centre for justice and crime prevention in 2009 .  the research found that just under half the 1 726 youngsters interviewed had been victims of cyber aggression .  one in three had been a victim of cyber aggression at school and 42 percent had experienced it outside school .  in the survey , a quarter of the youngsters said they had experienced bullying by sms .  one in five admitted to having bullied someone else by sms .  according to the survey findings , nearly 70 percent of those who had bullied others by sms had themselves been bullied .  in order of frequency , voice calls , smses , instant messages , used in the bullying .  the problem of bullying , whether cyber or conventional , has attracted the attention of one of the world 's entertainment stars .  pop diva lady gaga recently took her star power and some of her famous friends , including oprah winfrey , to harvard university in the us to launch a foundation aimed at empowering young people and stamping out bullying .  " if you have revolutionary potential , you must make the world a better place and use it , " gaga said as she launched the " born this way foundation " , named after her 2011 hit album and single . " this is about transformative change in culture . "  the singer has often been a voice for people she believes lack representation in the media , and she formed the foundation to address issues like self-confidence , well-being , bullying and the need for mentoring .  " i believe that humankind , as a whole , can change the world , " said gaga .  " the goal is to challenge meanness and cruelty their communities . "  winfrey said she had joined forces with gaga 's foundation because it shared some of her core beliefs , including the need to show kindness , compassion and care for others .  gaga said the three pillars of her foundation were to promote " safety , skills and opportunities " for young people .  " once you feel safe in your environment and you acquire the skills to be a loving , accepting , tolerant person , the opportunities are endless to be a functioning human in society . "  gaga 's foundation is expected to include specific outreach to young lesbians and gays .  born this way quickly became an unofficial anthem for gay empowerment and pride .  the singer said that releasing the song had helped propel the dialogue between her and her fans , which had became a calling of sorts .  " after i put the song out , the conversation ignited even further ... i never wanted this conversation to end . i thought how i could keep it going . and if anyone knows me . "  gaga has also put her " born brave bus " on the road , as a kind of drop-in centre for young people .  " the more kids that i can get to come and eat hamburgers and talk outside my shows , ( the better ) . i feel that it will start small , but over time will be very big . "  she knew there was " no one answer " or single law that could be passed to stop bullying and hatred or to mandate acceptance , gaga said .  " i wish there was because , you know , i would be chained naked to a fence to try to get one passed . " -- staff reporters and reuters
