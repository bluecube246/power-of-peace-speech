<h> Latecomer pupils locked out of school <p> INLSALOCKED OUT : Pupils of Orient Islamic School gather outside the schools gates after they were denied access for arriving late . Picture : Sbonelo Ngcobo <p> The new school term started badly for some pupils at Durban 's Orient Islamic School on Tuesday -- they were locked out for arriving minutes after the bell had sounded . <p> Their parents were left fuming after they were forced to return to the Centenary Road school to pick up their children , but school authorities defended the move , saying parents had been warned of the new lockout policy . <p> Fathima Padia said she and her daughter had arrived at the school at 7.33am -- three minutes after the bell summoning the children to their classrooms had sounded . <p> " When I got home I received a call from my daughter telling me to pick her up , " she said . <p> They usually left home at 7.10am to be at school by 7.20am , she said , but on Tuesday they left five minutes late , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of traffic lights we had to pass through was n't working " . <p> Padia said that when she arrived at the school , she found that about 50 children were clustered at the entrance . The children were not being allowed inside the premises and were standing around , not knowing what to do , she said . <p> Instructions <p> The children waited about 90 minutes before the school 's security received instructions to let the children in -- but only long enough to contact their parents so they could be sent home . <p> " The school has a ' no cellphones ' policy but , thankfully , my daughter had her phone with her , " Padia said . <p> " If she had n't , I do n't know how she would have contacted me . " <p> She claimed there was no adult supervision at the school gates and she had feared for the safety of the pupils , some of whom were as young as 14 . <p> When the Daily News arrived at the school on Tuesday morning , Padia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One pupil said people walking past had been asking them for cigarettes and trying to engage in conversation . <p> " We do n't feel safe , " she said . <p> Javed Aswani , whose sister is a pupil at the school , said that while he agreed with the school 's policy of sending latecomers home , he wanted the school at least to keep them somewhere safe while they waited for their parents . <p> " My sister is in Grade 8 and she had to wait outside for more than an hour , " he said . " She is the responsibility of the school when she 's at school . What if something happened ? What if she was kidnapped or robbed ? " <p> In June last year , in a circular issued by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education , officials noted " with great concern " the number of pupils coming to school late . <p> The circular instructed principals to close the gates after classes or assembly had started and to record the names of latecomers and phone their parents . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be locked out or turned away from school . <p> High priority <p> Orient Islamic School principal Ebrahim Ansur said yesterday that the school placed a high priority on the inculcation of discipline in pupils . <p> " Having observed an increase in the incidence of latecoming during the first term , the school notified parents at the end of the term that , as from April 10 this year , a lockout policy would be implemented for all latecomers , " he said . <p> " Parents were reminded about this policy via SMS on Monday , April 9 . " <p> Ansur said about 30 pupils were locked out for arriving after 7.30am , with several taken back home by their parents . <p> Those pupils who were left by their parents , he said , were at the school gates , which were manned by the school 's security personnel , whose task it was to ensure the safety of the pupils . <p> " These learners were subsequently allowed into the school premises . The school contacted the parents of these learners to fetch their children from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly encouraged by the excellent co-operation we have received from our parents and learners , as evidenced by the fact that out of a school population of 1 200 learners , there were comparatively few latecomers , " Ansur said . - Daily News <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?
