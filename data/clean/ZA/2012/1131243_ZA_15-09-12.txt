Protesters chanting " Russia without Putin " began marching through Moscow on Saturday in a protest seen as a test of the opposition 's ability to mount a sustained challenge to President Vladimir Putin .  Save &amp; Share  Several thousands demonstrators began marching under cloudy skies from the central Pushkin Square along a route that will take them close to the Kremlin in what is intended to be the first big opposition rally for three months .  Some had banners declaring " the release of three members of the Pussy Riot punk band who were jailed after singing a profanity-laced " punk prayer " in a church .  The demonstration will indicate whether the protest movement that began nine months ago , and has at times attracted tens of thousands of people to rallies , still has momentum four months after Putin began a six-year term as president .  Although the Kremlin announced minor political reforms after the demonstrations began last December , Putin 's presidential election victory in March took the sting out of the protests and the opposition remains disunited , without a clear leader .  " We are protesting against the total lawlessness , total corruption , the lack of civil freedoms , the absence of independent courts and social injustice , " said Sergei Yevseyev , 35 , who works for an international shipping company .  He said Putin 's style of government was no longer effective more than a decade after he first became president and added : " When he first came to power we needed this toughness , but not any more slowly to Pushkin Square , the starting point , and the early signs were that the rally might not attract the 50,000 the opposition hoped for . Police were out in force although the organisers received permission for the rally .  OPPOSITION STRUGGLES FOR UNITY  The Kremlin has dismissed the protesters as a minority that does not have wide support across the country of more than 140 million .  Putin 's opponents say his return to the presidency after four years as premier is a bad sign for democracy as he has already dominated Russia for 12 years . They fear his new term will be marred by political and economic stagnation .  But the opposition has struggled to unite its various groups - including nationalists , leftists and middle-class liberals - under one leader and they have no clear programme beyond a common desire to oust the 59-year-old Kremlin chief .  It is the first time the opposition has tried to gather large numbers at a protest since a court jailed the three Pussy Riot members for storming into Moscow 's main Russian Orthodox cathedral close ties with the clergy .  Opinions polls show few Russians sympathised with the protest itself , but the severity of the band members ' treatment widened divisions in society , with liberals complaining of a crackdown on dissent by the former KGB officer .  The opposition is also upset by new laws that increased protesters ' fines , stiffened punishments for defamation and imposed new controls on foreign-funded campaign groups .  In another setback for the protesters , opposition deputy Gennady Gudkov was expelled from parliament on Friday on allegations of illegally continuing business activities while holding a mandate in the assembly .  " In the 100 days since Putin 's return to the Kremlin we see that he has shown all the symptoms of this new political course - that is a tightening of the screws , " said former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov , who is now an opposition leader .  Protests were also planned in St Petersburg and in Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains .
