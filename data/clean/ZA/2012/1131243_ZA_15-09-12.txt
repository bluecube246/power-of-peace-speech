They fear his new term will be marred by political and economic stagnation . <p> But the opposition has struggled to unite its various groups - including nationalists , leftists and middle-class liberals - under one leader and they have no clear programme beyond a common desire to oust the 59-year-old Kremlin chief . <p> It is the first time the opposition has tried to gather large numbers at a protest since a court jailed the three Pussy Riot members for storming into Moscow 's main Russian Orthodox cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close ties with the clergy . <p> Opinions polls show few Russians sympathised with the protest itself , but the severity of the band members ' treatment widened divisions in society , with liberals complaining of a crackdown on dissent by the former KGB officer . <p> The opposition is also upset by new laws that increased protesters ' fines , stiffened punishments for defamation and imposed new controls on foreign-funded campaign groups . <p> In another setback for the protesters , opposition deputy Gennady Gudkov was expelled from parliament on Friday on allegations of illegally continuing business activities while holding a mandate in the assembly . <p> " In the 100 days since Putin 's return to the Kremlin we see that he has shown all the symptoms of this new political course - that is a tightening of the screws , " said former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov , who is now an opposition leader . <p> Protests were also planned in St Petersburg and in Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains .
