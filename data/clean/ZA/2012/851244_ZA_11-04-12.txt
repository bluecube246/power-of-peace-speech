Ghana and Nigeria among world 's fastest growing economies in 2012/2013  The west African nations of Ghana and Nigeria are expected to be among the world 's fastest growing economies in 2012 , according to an emailed research note by Charles Robertson , global chief economist at Renaissance Capital .  In 2011 , Ghana was the fastest growing economy from a total of 43 markets included in Renaissance 's graphs . This growth was largely off the back of Ghana 's new oil industry . Nigeria had the 6th highest GDP growth , ahead of India .  In 2012 , Ghana is again expected to show the strongest GDP growth , with Nigeria in 4th position .  However , next year Ghana 's growth will slow down , while Nigeria is likely to remain in 4th position . " Finally Ghana shifts out of overdrive and gives Asia a chance to shine a little -- though personally I doubt China will be growing at 9% in 2013 . Around 7% to 8% looks more realistic , if only due to base effects , , the continent 's largest economy , is likely to grow faster than Australia . " It might be a good time for the South Africans who emigrated to Australia to sell up their inflated property prices , sell the overvalued AUD and move back to South Africa , " says Robertson .  " A lot of the emerging Europe , Middle East and Africa economies we cover are doing an awful lot better than most give them credit for . Helped by Nigeria , Kazakhstan and Ghana , they take two to three places in the top 5 in 2011-13 . South Africa consistently beats developed market commodity exporters , " says Robertson .
