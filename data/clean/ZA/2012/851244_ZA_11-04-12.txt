ghana and nigeria among world 's fastest growing economies in 2012/2013  the west african nations of ghana and nigeria are expected to be among the world 's fastest growing economies in 2012 , according to an emailed research note by charles robertson , global chief economist at renaissance capital .  in 2011 , ghana was the fastest growing economy from a total of 43 markets included in renaissance 's graphs . this growth was largely off the back of ghana 's new oil industry . nigeria had the 6th highest gdp growth , ahead of india .  in 2012 , ghana is again expected to show the strongest gdp growth , with nigeria in 4th position .  however , next year ghana 's growth will slow down , while nigeria is likely to remain in 4th position . " finally ghana shifts out of overdrive and gives asia a chance to shine a little -- though personally i doubt china will be growing at 9% in 2013 . around 7% to 8% looks more realistic , if only due to base effects , , the continent 's largest economy , is likely to grow faster than australia . " it might be a good time for the south africans who emigrated to australia to sell up their inflated property prices , sell the overvalued aud and move back to south africa , " says robertson .  " a lot of the emerging europe , middle east and africa economies we cover are doing an awful lot better than most give them credit for . helped by nigeria , kazakhstan and ghana , they take two to three places in the top 5 in 2011-13 . south africa consistently beats developed market commodity exporters , " says robertson .
