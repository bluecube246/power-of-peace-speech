<h> Brands that have stood the test of time <p> What do Coca-Cola , Cadbury , Levi Strauss &amp; Co. , Volkswagen , KFC , Marlboro cigarettes and Mrs Balls Chutney all have in common ? They all have lived through at least one World War , the rise and fall of Communism , the ' flower power ' 60 's , the first man on the moon , bad hair of the 1980s and not to forget the most recent financial crisis . <p> None of these brands is an absolute physical necessity , yet these brands have always been a part of our lives - and do n't seem to be going anywhere . <p> If you take time to consider some of the great brands that have always been around , they pretty much still look the same , taste the same and feel the same . For example , in the 1920s , Marlboro the world 's largest selling cigarette brand , initially targeted female smokers with their ' Mild as May ' tagline and feminine focussed advertising . In the 1950s they changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since then , very little has changed to the Marlboro brand . That 's over 60 years with still the same cowboy ' Marlboro Man ' , product and packaging . 60 years of success without much radical change is rather astounding . <p> The great brands that have been around for many generations have all stuck to their brand values and personality . They 've been consistent , while adapting and refreshing themselves as consumers and market conditions have changed - but all have done so without comprising their core brand essence . Take Coca-Cola for instance - from 1886 to 2005 the famous beverage brand has had 168 different taglines , yet their brand positioning has remained fairly consistent . <p> As the saying goes : " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " . Coca-Cola learnt this the hard way when introducing ' New Coke ' in 1985 , a reformulation of the product with a campaign slogan of ' The new taste of Coca-Cola ' . New Coke attracted great consumer backlash and subsequently led to the re-introduction of the original , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn from the good , old favourites like Coca-Cola , Marlboro and the others I have mentioned ? <p> Firstly , ruthless consistency over time pays . Cadbury has always stuck with their signature purple ; and consistently market their ' glass and a half ' of milk in each chocolate . Similarly , Volkswagen has constantly focussed on people . KFC has the ever present Colonel Sanders and special ' 11 herbs and spices ' recipe consistently applied to the marketing campaigns . Consistency is critical to ingrain your position and message to customers . When a company , product or service is unpredictable or confusing , the reputation of a brand becomes questionable and simply can not build momentum . <p> Next , rather refresh than radically change : People fall in love with a particular brand for a specific reason - whether it is what the brand stands for , its personality , its product or service offering or the message it sends out . Like a person , if any of these characteristics change fundamentally , the brand can lose its integrity and subsequently its fans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans-wear brand with a brand essence that has remained fairly consistent over the decades . Yet , when Levi 's discovered that a large proportion of women were unsatisfied with how jeans fitted ( or rather did n't fit ) their all-important derri ? re , they quickly responded with the Levi 's EVA range that was designed especially for ladies with a few more curves . They did this without compromising their classic heritage or completely overhauling their product range . A refresh from time to time is essential to stay abreast of market trends and to avoid complacency . In 1991 , Kentucky Fried Chicken refreshed their branding and name to KFC taking into account that people were opting for healthier methods of cooking and therefore chose to focus less on the ' Fried ' in their name . <p> Finally , do n't underestimate the power of your product ( or service ) in building and maintaining a strong brand . No brand will last over time if the product and the value associated with it , is not up to scratch . The strength of Mrs Balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor , locally or from aboard can even try replicate or improve the taste and flavour of this South African favourite . The reliability of the product is solid and thus , the power of the brand is undeniable . <p> Though many of the famous brands may not be necessities or items that guarantee our physical well-being ; they still are cherished and loved throughout the world . Through careful brand management these great brands have made us smile , satisfied our cravings , brought people together and most importantly , have been dependable . They 've been around before most of us were born and will most likely be around for many years still to come - they 've truly been brands that have stood the test of time . <p> LEGAL DISCLAIMER : This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards ( e.g. defamation , slander , or other such crimes ) .
