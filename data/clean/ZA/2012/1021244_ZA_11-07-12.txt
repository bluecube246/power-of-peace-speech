<h> Arts and culture <h> SA dancer burning up international stage <p> 11 July 2012 South African champion dancer Keoikantse Motsepe has joined the cast of the internationally successful Burn the Floor company , which kicked off a three-city The Temperature Rises South African tour in Cape Town on Wednesday night . Motsepe has been the undefeated South African Latin American champion since 2004 , but began his journey as a dancer at the age of five when a friend suggested they give it a try . By seven , he knew he had found his calling . He went for formal training at the Corenergy Dance Centre in Johannesburg and began representing South Africa in all major Latin Dance championships internationally in 2003 . He was also the country 's representative at the World Latin Championships in New York City in 2010 . <h> His ' Burn the Floor ' journey <p> Motsepe 's spot as a cast member of Burn the Floor came about purely by chance as he did not even want to watch the show when it first toured Johannesburg in July and August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said this week . " But after a few seconds , I realised it was the best dance show I had ever seen . I was blown away , to be honest ; I ca n't describe the feeling . " This prompted him to contact Burn the Floor 's company manager and executive producer , Peta Roby . He secured an audition and began touring with the company in January on its Burn the Floor - The Temperature Rises tour . " Dreams certainly do come true , " Motsepe said . The show has travelled around the United States , China and Australia and has just embarked on its South African leg of the tour , which will cover Cape Town , Johannesburg and Durban . Although Motsepe has not been with the company for long , he has made an impression . " Keo his nickname is a breath of fresh air , polite , a real gentleman and very popular in the company , " said director and choreographer Jason Gilkison . " His family should be proud . His work ethic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance floor - simple : he owns it , " Gilkison said . " The South African audiences are in for a real treat . " <h> Raising the mercury <p> The response to Burn the Floor 's 2011 tour to Johannesburg was overwhelming , and the company played to sold-out audiences at The Joburg Theatre Complex . Cape Town residents wanted a piece of the action , which led to the company deciding to return to South Africa in 2012 for a more comprehensive tour . The Temperature Rises tour will run at the Artscape Opera House in Cape Town from 11 to 29 July , before making its way to the Joburg Theatre from 1 to 19 August and the Playhouse Opera Theatre in Durban from 22 August to 2 September . Audiences can expect electricity on the stage , with 18 international championship dancers at the top of their game . For those who have already seen the show in Johannesburg , they need not expect the same tricks to be rehashed . " I have re-choreographed numerous numbers , changed five songs in the show and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The show 's new ending will blow you away , and blow any perceptions you have of ballroom dancing . " The show 's creator , Harley Medcalf , agreed : " It takes the performance to a whole new level , feel and energy . " <h> Humble beginnings <p> Burn the Floor began as just a special performance for Sir Elton John 's 50th birthday celebrations in 1997 . A group of 16 dancers performed a 10-minute dance cabaret , which inspired Medcalf , an Australian theatre producer , to build a full-length stage show around the same concept . Burn the Floor has since become a worldwide phenomenon , having toured 30 countries and over 160 cities . It features performers from 10 countries , who have over 100 championship dance titles between them . The show uses what is called " international style " , which is made up of 10 dances - five standard ballroom and five Latin American dances .
