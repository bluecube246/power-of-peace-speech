Local Real Estate  Subscribe Now  Axle is one of Australia 's first autism assistance dogs and you do n't often see Jordan without him .  And they will be seeing a lot more of each other when term four starts at Gabbinbar State School , because Axle is due to start work in a school setting .  Jordan 's mum Rebecca Schuh is thrilled with the new arrangement , which will mean Jordan has full emotional support from his best mate every day as well as an ice-breaker when chatting with other kids .  " Imagine how much easier it will be for Jordan when he can go to school with a dog who can shake hands and high-five to break the ice , as well as supporting him emotionally , " she said .  " They have been together for about two-and-a-half years now and we could n't live without Axle . "  Tethered to Jordan when they are out together , Axle is trained to gently interrupt Jordan when he is engaged in repetitive behaviour , drop to if he does run away , and also to be one of the few mates Jordan can easily comprehend .  There are a huge number of ways to help Righteous Pups carry out this special service .
