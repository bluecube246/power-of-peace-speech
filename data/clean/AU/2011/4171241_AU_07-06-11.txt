Aelita Andre: A toddler Picasso or a kid waving a paintbrush?

<p> I love the art world . No pretension , just the searing search for greater truths . <p> Today I dared roll an eye and raise a brow of scepticism about all the excitement being created here . And I asked what we were actually looking at ; some lovely paintings by a little kid or the evolution of a genius ? <p> At least three buyers have already paid about 27 thousand dollars each for her work , so I guess they 're hoping genius prevails . <p> I received a couple of great responses via text . The first , castigating me . <p> " Ahhhh the tall poppy syndrome is alive and well it seems . Good on you Geoff . Nothing like doubting and marginalising another gifted child . Enough of the eye rolling and sarcasm . Some kids really are remarkable - even if they 're just kids . " <p> I do n't think I 'm the one who is marginalising this child am I ? And of course , many kids are gifted ; but the point I was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintbrush wielding , violin playing , soccer ball heading poppets are being touted as the " next this " or the " heir to " that . <p> And pushy , deluded parents see fame and fortune and reflected glory in it all and risk seriously damaging those kids along the way . <p> Time will determine whether four year old Aelita Andre is indeed some kind of prodigy and good luck to her if she fulfils the expectations being put on those thin shoulders . But I rather like Damian 's take on all this . <p> " My son did #2 's in his potty and proudly showed me , because he thought it looked like a crab ! ! ! Genius ! ! ! "
