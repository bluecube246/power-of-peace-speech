One of the most useful iPhone apps in the Qantas frequent flyer 's arsenal , the unofficial Frequent Flyer Calculator , has received an update , with a multi-trip calculator plus additional saved history space in version 2.0 -- and it 's now free , to boot .  Australian designer Adam Ware has also ensured that the app wo n't be suddenly yanked from the store by Qantas ' legal team , with an " updated design to avoid copyright issues " , including no more Qantas-like red colour in the app .  But the updates -- especially the multi-trip calculator -- are really useful for business travellers .  It 'll help to work out your end-of-qualifying-year Platinum or Gold status situation and figure out when exactly you 'll have enough points to book that redemption ticket to somewhere relaxing .  It 's simple to add even complicated multi-stop , open-jaw itineraries like this one ( **50;328;TOOLONG ) to the system : just tap in the airport code and hit the green Add button .  Link your Qantas Frequent Flyer number or spit out precisely how many status credits and points you 'll have after your journey .  You can also drill down into the details to figure out exactly which flight earns what .  That 's useful because , for example , you can figure out exactly when your account will turn from Gold to Platinum , allowing you to use the First Class lounges instead of the Business Class ones .  You 'll also discover details like the fact that you get an extra 40 status credits by stopping in Singapore from Australia instead of going straight through .
