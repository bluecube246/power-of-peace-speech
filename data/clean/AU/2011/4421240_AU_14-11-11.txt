Community  Clubs agree to sign Licence Agreements  All sixteen NRL Clubs have today agreed to sign ' club licences ' with the ARL Commission .  Club Chairmen and Chief Executives today met with the Commission at the NRL following several weeks of discussion with the game 's existing partners , the ARL and News Limited over funding .  Wests Tigers Director , Mr David Trodden , said that the meeting had cleared the way for all clubs to sign licenses to compete for the next seven years :  " Today confirmed to everyone that the Commissioners are the right people to have in place and the clubs left more convinced than ever that the Commission is the right structure for the game .  " Over the last few weeks it 's been important that people understand the financial pressures that clubs face and that they address the best ways of ensuring clubs are able to remain strong into the future .  " Inevitably that has led to some emotion but the spirit of the process has been to ensure the first opportunity for the clubs to sit down with the Commissioners and to discuss the issues with the people who will govern the game .  " The clubs walked away convinced that the game is heading in the right direction . "  NRL Chief Executive , Mr David Gallop , said that the decision by the clubs was an important step towards the Commission being formalised :  " The issues facing the clubs have been recognised for some time which is why we have worked for so long to narrow the gap between the club grant and the Salary Cap .  " The more people interact with the Commissioners , the more they are seeing the value of their involvement .  " Today 's outcome is a real vote of confidence in the changes that are taking place and it is important that we continue with that momentum . "
