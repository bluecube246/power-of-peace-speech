electricity 's uncertain future  as the debate over the government 's carbon tax intensifies , the future of australia 's electricity industry becomes more unclear .  transcript  leigh sales , presenter : thanks , chris . the gillard government is trying to tackle the opposition 's scare campaign on carbon tax head on by releasing treasury estimates about the tax 's economic impact  in a speech in canberra today the treasurer , wayne swan , said the figures prove the carbon tax will have a negligible effect on wages , growth and employment .  uncertainty around the politics of the issue is prompting warnings of a dire impact on the electricity sector .  as greg hoy reports , some industry players say get ready for power shortages and widespread blackouts .  pro carbon tax rally organiser : as we speak here there 's rallies going around in each state and territory of australia .  crowd : yeah !  greg hoy , reporter : fact or fiction ?  heat is rising in the carbon debate , prompting dire electricity will outgrow the security of supply , threatening widespread brown or black outs .  mike harrowell , market analyst , bby : we are likely to be running into a shortage of capacity some time within the next five years . where you will see the problems are during peak loadings , and that will just mean that we will have less reliable electricity than we would normally want .  greg hoy : it 's a view heavily promoted by the carbon-exposed coal fired power industry , which generates the vast majority of the nation 's electricity .  richard mcindoe , truenergy : i think there 's going to be real challenges during the peak times .  greg hoy : the head of australia 's largest private electricity utility , international power , agrees .  tony concannon , executive director , international power ( abc radio , 26 may , 2011 ) : it has taken almost 50 years to build that infrastructure . you ca n't just close your eyes and wish for that all to change .  richard mcindoe : we are 's a base load supply or peak supply now , because of this uncertainty .  greg hoy : but some in the industry say the situation is no way near so dire , given sound investment over the past decade .  carl mccamish , origin energy : there has been more than 10,000 megawatts of new generation in the market , which is between 20 and 25 per cent of the total existing capacity .  so that 's a pretty high replacement rate . you 'd say that that 's quite a lot of investment for a market of our size over that period of time . and right up , even through today you 've got a lot of investment going on in wind and the solar and you are seeing investment in the peaker plants .  carl mccamish : it 's not a question of power shortages . power shortages only happen if you 've got not enough capacity in the system . in the peaker plants , the smaller plants that can ramp up and down quickly at times of peak demand - they 've been investing in and the market is projecting to invest in as well . they will cover the issue of the lights going off . ( laughs )  greg hoy : but coal fired power producers have much to lose and much to gain from this debate , especially the biggest and dirtiest of all - the brown coal fired hazelwood plant in victoria . it pumps 8 per cent of electricity into the national grid and 3 per cent of the emissions into the atmosphere . its future under the carbon cloud , hazelwood 's local management international power would n't talk to 7:30 .  greg hoy : but the company 's australian subsidiary is seeking compensation from government if a carbon price is imposed , claiming this would breach a government approval in 2005 , extending the licence to operate the controversial hazelwood power plant .  tony concannon ( abc radio , 26 may ) : as a result of that approval we then invested another half a billion dollars into that asset , based on that . so what we are talking about is , it 's called sovereign risk .  greg hoy : but is it really sovereign risk when a public statement announcing the government approval of the time specifically mentioned carbon emissions ?  " a future greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme will still apply to hazelwood power station and could place obligations on hazelwood 's owners additional to requirements of the deed . "  tony wood , energy director , grattan institute : everyone in industry knows that major companies for quite some time have been factoring in a price on carbon to their major investment decisions .  greg hoy : for how long ?  tony wood : i would suggest at least 10 years .  greg hoy : the grattan institute 's energy director tony wood spent 11 years as an executive in the power industry and three as director of the clinton foundation 's clean energy program .  tony wood : if you are an asset owner , you do n't like change . we may see black coal generators running more than brown coal generators . we may see gas generators running .  greg hoy : the problem is australia 's reliance on emissions-intensive coal power is rising , as are global carbon concerns .  at business forums here and overseas there is talk of inevitable investment changes ahead .  jeremy benthan , vice president , shell global business : the stresses in the energy and other related systems are real and are building , and inevitably will force transition .  grant anderson , partner , allens arthur robinson : i think the expectation in industry is that at some stage - it may not be immediately - there will be a carbon price on carbon , so industry does plan for that in the longer term .  tony wood : companies around the world who can see the future first and get there first are the ones who are going to capitalise .  greg hoy : the suggestion is energy companies with the most flexible and cleanest fuel sources are the best investment in the brave new carbon conscious world .  jeremy benthan : the biggest , fastest , most reliable way to start addressing emit less than half the co2 of a coal fired power station .  greg hoy : but coal is cheaper , so to reduce reliance on it will require a carbon price . the proposed price of $20 to $25 a tonne will make black coal power plants more productive than messier brown coal powered plants like hazelwood , but greater investment in gas will require a bigger carbon price again .  carl mccamish : if you do want to create the significant change that comes with moving to more gas base load , then you are looking at prices that are above $20 to $25 . you are looking at $35 and above .  greg hoy : which would of course mean a politicians ' picnic , but would it mean the end of the world as we know it ?  are the days of cheap power in australia past ?  tony wood : relative to cost of living , our energy prices are going to stay relatively low . so i do n't think this is a fundamental risk to our standard of life today after significant increases recently , are at the average- the price they were as a proportion of average australian household income about 40 years ago .  there will be pressure upward on fuel price , but seen in an overall context , and compared to other countries , australia will remain a low to average cost country for electricity .
