karen barlow : qantas says as the pilot informed the airline he was not prepared to work as expected on the flight to melbourne , so qantas informed him he was not required on the flight .  if there was an emergency mid flight and the plane was diverted , captain anderson 's action would have made him unavailable to fly further .  ( extract from qantas statement )  the pilot has not been stood down . he indicated to qantas he was not prepared to work as required , so was replaced for that trip only .  ( end of statement )  karen barlow : captain steve anderson will now be a passenger on the melbourne bound flight he was supposed to fly . qantas says it does n't want any industrial action to delay passengers .  ( extract from qantas statement )  ultimately this is an issue about customer care and qantas was not prepared to pay captain anderson his full and very extensive wages to perform partial duties .  ( end of statement )  karen .  nick xenophon , independent senator : this pilot is acting in accordance with the rules of the umpire , fair work australia , it is a protected industrial action and if he 's going to be penalised as a result of doing what the umpire says he can do , well , that seems completely unfair .  karen barlow : qantas also denies a perth-based licensed engineer was stood down last friday for also taking work to rule industrial action that involved reading instruction manuals twice .  ( extract from qantas statement )  qantas was not prepared to accept that he was going to perform partial duties while maintaining an aircraft - which is a potential safety issue .  ( end of statement )  karen barlow : qantas subsidiary , jetstar , is also fighting problems with foreign staff . lateline revealed allegations this week that jetstar has been exploiting foreign cabin crews , demanding they work 20 hour shifts , exposing them to fatigue .  independent senator nick xenophon now wants to change the law .  nick xenophon : if it carrier , the rules that apply to flight crew , to cabin attendants , should be the same . this bill would provide that level of protection .  karen barlow : jetstar says the private senator 's bill is not needed . it says the same duty limitations already apply under jetstar 's fatigue management system and the law for all cabin crew regardless of where they 're based .  karen barlow , lateline .  do you have a comment or a story idea ? get in touch with the lateline team by clicking here .
