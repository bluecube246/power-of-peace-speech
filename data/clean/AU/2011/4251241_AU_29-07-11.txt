<p> KAREN BARLOW : Qantas says as the pilot informed the airline he was not prepared to work as expected on the flight to Melbourne , so Qantas informed him he was not required on the flight . <p> If there was an emergency mid flight and the plane was diverted , Captain Anderson 's action would have made him unavailable to fly further . <p> ( EXTRACT FROM QANTAS STATEMENT ) <p> The pilot has not been stood down . He indicated to Qantas he was not prepared to work as required , so was replaced for that trip only . <p> ( END OF STATEMENT ) <p> KAREN BARLOW : Captain Steve Anderson will now be a passenger on the Melbourne bound flight he was supposed to fly . Qantas says it does n't want any industrial action to delay passengers . <p> ( EXTRACT FROM QANTAS STATEMENT ) <p> Ultimately this is an issue about customer care and Qantas was not prepared to pay Captain Anderson his full and very extensive wages to perform partial duties . <p> ( END OF STATEMENT ) <p> KAREN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> NICK XENOPHON , INDEPENDENT SENATOR : This pilot is acting in accordance with the rules of the umpire , Fair Work Australia , it is a protected industrial action and if he 's going to be penalised as a result of doing what the umpire says he can do , well , that seems completely unfair . <p> KAREN BARLOW : Qantas also denies a Perth-based licensed engineer was stood down last Friday for also taking work to rule industrial action that involved reading instruction manuals twice . <p> ( EXTRACT FROM QANTAS STATEMENT ) <p> Qantas was not prepared to accept that he was going to perform partial duties while maintaining an aircraft - which is a potential safety issue . <p> ( END OF STATEMENT ) <p> KAREN BARLOW : Qantas subsidiary , Jetstar , is also fighting problems with foreign staff . Lateline revealed allegations this week that Jetstar has been exploiting foreign cabin crews , demanding they work 20 hour shifts , exposing them to fatigue . <p> Independent Senator Nick Xenophon now wants to change the law . <p> NICK XENOPHON : If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier , the rules that apply to flight crew , to cabin attendants , should be the same . This bill would provide that level of protection . <p> KAREN BARLOW : Jetstar says the private Senator 's bill is not needed . It says the same duty limitations already apply under Jetstar 's fatigue management system and the law for all cabin crew regardless of where they 're based . <p> Karen Barlow , Lateline . <p> Do you have a comment or a story idea ?
