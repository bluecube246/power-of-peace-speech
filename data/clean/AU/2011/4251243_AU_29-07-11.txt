Red Dog no longer roams the Top End but his story lives on in a much-loved book and now heart-warming family film .  IN 1998 , popular English author Louis de Bernieres was invited to Karratha , in Australia 's iron-rich north-west , for the town 's first literary event . Next day , the manager of his hotel offered to lend him his ute so he could see some of the country . Karratha , in the sprawling Pilbara , is that kind of place . He thought it was a detour on the grey tourist route but , as far as he could see , he was the only outsider in town . An excellent fish and chip shop in Port Hedland , a mere 200-odd kilometres away , was the nearest attraction .  " And on the side of that road , there 's a statue of a dog . I got out and looked at it and it said something like ' Red Dog 1979 , erected by his friends ' . So I thought , ' That 's really interesting , who is this Red Dog and why has he got a statue ? ' " When he got back to the hotel , de Bernieres started asking questions .  He was directed to the local library , where clippings and a couple of booklets by local writers indicated that the immortalised Red Dog had been quite a tourist himself ; local legend had it that he had wandered the whole Top End , with sightings reported in Darwin and even as far south as Perth . Here was the ideal material for that children 's book his agent thought he should write . A few months later , de Bernieres -- best known for writing Captain Corel-li 's Mandolin -- came back with a laptop and set off on a tour of dots on the map where his research showed Red Rachel Taylor with prize pooch Koko .  Everyone had a story , although they were generally one line long -- " Remember the time Red Dog busted up the dog show ? " -- which meant he could embroider them as much as he liked . He only travelled for two weeks . " But that 's all you need for a little book like that , " he says . " And , of course , whilst I was there I bought lots of material about the local wildlife and the local vegetable life , so I was able to look up the various snakes and insects and plants that were there to make it look as if I knew the place better than I do . It was probably the happiest time I 've had writing a book , really , because I was driving around finding stories in the daytime -- you know -- and eating oysters in the evening . "  Advertisement  Red Dog has now been adapted as a family movie that opens this week . With an $8 million budget supported by . The film is nominally for children , although the evidence at screenings I 've attended suggests anyone who has ever patted a dog will be scrabbling for a tissue by the end . Set in a rough-as-guts pub and framed as a wake for the now-dead Red Dog , the stories are told as recollections by his human friends : how he once saved the life of a miner who was going to kill himself ; how he chose a travelling American as his master and refused to belong to anyone else after he died ; how he managed to hitch to the Top End , presumably with paw stuck out , as a lone dog ; how a bunch of hard blokes shared responsibility for driving him hundreds of kilometres to get to a vet when he was poorly .  In the end , the film is primarily the story of these human characters . They were n't angels , obviously . Anyone who has seen the 1971 classic Wake in Fright , which starred Donald Pleasence as a young teacher appalled by the brutality , bleakness and But somehow , Stenders has managed to convey the roughness of the men and their lives while maintaining family friendliness ; there are no beatings , no bordellos , no swearing and not so much as the whiff of a cigarette . " When I was pitching it , " he says , " I said it was Wake in Fright meets Pixar . "  Red Dog author Louis de Bernieres . Photo : Reuters  What Wake in Fright lamented , however , Red Dog celebrates . " That period setting -- in a way , it was the Wild West , " Stenders says . " These guys came there with the smell of money , the smell of fortune and they came from all round the world and worked in stubbies and basic work boots and terry towelling hats -- this is all pre-occupational safety , pre-sunscreen -- and they worked very , very hard . We felt we had to pay homage to that generation , so that the roughness was just colour , great texture and detail for us to work with . "  and Luke Ford star opposite Koko , a five-year-old pure-bred red cloud kelpie . Noah Taylor , who plays a publican whose teeth pay their own independent homage to Chad Morgan , says the film shoot shared something of that atmosphere . " It was a very male world and it was a very male shoot , " he says . " There were two actresses and they had to suffer major testosterone poisoning travelling round trying to re-create ' 70s Australia . It came a little too easily to a few people . " Not that he thinks that was a bad thing . " There has been a kind of pansification of the Australian male -- a general softening of the Western world , really . In a way , it 's good to hark back to our roots . "  But as in Lassie or Rin Tin Tin , the human storylines are transformed from soapy humdrum by its animal hero , a marvellous beast that seems to understand everything without needing to speak : who needs help , who should not be trusted , who needs do . You ca n't beat a good dog story , even if there is a distinct shagginess to some of these ones . De Bernieres says he doubts Red Dog really went to Perth . " Somebody told me that , so I put it in anyway , " he says .  But according to Nelson Woss , the film 's producer , it is incontrovertible fact ; he talked to the bloke who took him there in his truck , left him for a few minutes to run around Cottesloe Beach and then thought he 'd lost him . " He searched all next day and decided he had to go back to Dampier without him ; he said it was the worst trip he 'd ever made , " Woss says . " But when he got to Dampier , Red Dog had beaten him to it . True story ! ' ' True enough , anyway . ' ' It 's a bit like Ned Kelly ; it 's very hard to differentiate truth from myth . ' '  It certainly has the power of German high-school students as part of the Berlin International Film Festival , where films are screened without subtitles as an exercise in learning English . Most of those kids must have found the accents impenetrable but it did n't matter : the tissues were duly passed along the rows . Afterwards , I was one of a sprinkling of adults in a shuttle bus waiting to be taken back to the main festival centre . A man was walking his dog - a black dog but never mind - on the nature strip . All eyes turned towards him as he sniffed the smells dogs like . There was silence . Then one girl piped up - ' ' Ein hund ! ' ' - and the whole bus sighed .  Red Dog was a kelpie . On screen , he is played by charismatic hound Koko and a number of stand-in and second-unit red kelpies who could pass muster for the star at a middle distance . They may be loveable on screen but working with dogs , Taylor says , is not easy . ' ' I 'm ' ' he says darkly . ' ' I 'm a dog person . I do n't want to disparage the entire dog community but their cleverness is overrated - and the same goes for dolphins . I 've worked with both . ' '  Stenders is more generous . There were times , he says , when Koko simply ran out of enthusiasm .  ' ' I keep on saying that working with Koko is exactly the same as working with an actor , ' ' he says . ' ' Each actor is very different , every performer has a different way of presenting material . Some actors do really well on their first take , some do well on their third take - and Koko was the same . He got tired . He was a very spontaneous actor - and he was acting .  ' ' So he was actually wonderful . I always say 99 per cent of directing is casting and if we 'd picked the wrong dog , we would have been in trouble . ' '  But dogs , human actors do n't share . Koko mingled easily ; his trainer set him loose on the set early so he would be comfortable with lights , cameras and the crew . But they found that they had to be careful not to make sudden loud noises , which meant that movements such as clapping had to be mimed and dubbed afterwards . ' ' And the yells - a lot of men in a pub yelling is a very big , aggressive , loud sound , ' ' Woss says .  But he did enjoy being the centre of attention , to the extent that he disliked any other dog being around to steal his limelight . He also knew when the camera was on him . Woss and Koko are now lifetime companions ; he adopted Koko after filming . ' ' Now I take the dog for a walk down Hastings Street in Perth , where the mall is , and he really lights up . I think he thinks it 's a really big sequence that Kriv is directing with a lot of extras , ' , I like Koko but there is a certain vanity in that dog . ' '  According to Woss , Koko 's great asset was that he had trained in a way that avoided coercion . ' ' Red Dog , the real red dog , was very independent and did his own thing , ' ' he says . ' ' When you train a dog , you can train it in a certain way where he 's very alert , waiting for a command - and it is very noticeable when a dog is like that . Now , the performance Koko gives , he 's taking commands but he looks like a dog making up his mind . Koko was trained that way . ' '  All this was exactly in keeping with what drew de Bernieres to the story . He was brought up with dogs - in fact , he was taught to walk by the family golden retriever , hanging on to the yellow scruff of the dog 's neck as he took his first baby steps . ' ' He 'd plod ' ' de Bernieres says . ' ' And then , when I could n't sleep at night , I 'd go and sleep with him in the dog basket . ' '  Now he prefers cats , if only by a whisker . What he immediately liked about Red Dog , he says , was what he saw as his feline side .  ' ' This was a dog , I think , with the temperament of a slightly stroppy cat , ' ' he says . ' ' You know what I mean ? Most dogs are terribly eager to please , to the point of being embarrassing . But Red Dog was fairly aloof . He accepted what people gave him , I think , with some dignity , as if it were his right . He treated people as equals , which dogs are n't supposed to do . ' ' So he suited the landscape and those rough , tough miners ? De Bernieres laughs . ' ' Exactly . A pioneering dog has to have a pioneering attitude . ' '
