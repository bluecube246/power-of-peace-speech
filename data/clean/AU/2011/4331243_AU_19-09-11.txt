Brighton Rock DVD Review

too often , film adaptations or remakes are compared to their original inspiration instead of judged as a standalone work . the film must always be better than or worse than the original , but no matter what happens it is always defined by what came before .  such is the case with rowan joffe 's brighton rock , a film that must live up to a 1938 graham greene novel and a 1947 john boulting film of the same name . most critics have stated the 2010 film as a remake falls short of the original ; i have n't seen the original nor have i read the novel , but i most definitely must say that overall , brighton rock was a disappointment .  plot  the narrative tells of a thug named pinkie brown , who is a member of the spicer 's gang . when the rival mob in brighton , run by colleoni , kills brown 's boss , he seeks revenge in the form of killing a member of colleoni 's gang . however , a young waitress named in order to keep her quiet . rose 's boss becomes increasingly suspicious of their relationship , and soon it becomes difficult to tell whether pinkie is falling for rose or if she is just a part of his plan .  as far as narratives go , brighton rock is one part crime-thriller and one part film/neo-noir ( depending on how technical you want to get ) . the film begins wonderfully , and ends with a twist that , really , is n't a twist because any half-intelligent member of the audience would see it coming . however , this ' twist ' is what ends up breaking the film and sending it on a downward spiral , just like its protagonist .  watching the film , it 's hard to believe joffe had two previous storylines to work with because the film seemed to disintegrate from the halfway mark . with the story already mostly formulated from the novel and 1947 film , all joffe had to do was work through the plot and make it a believable yet tragic tale . what resulted instead was an a gangster and his lover -- even the script itself was unengaging and felt forced at times .  characters  the main character in the film is pinkie -- an antihero , if i had to box him into a category . pinkie is cold and calculating , but ( unlike most other antiheroes ) there is so little of his personality or actions that are actually relatable . in the beginning of the film , pinkie 's motives behind his actions were clear and understandable ; as the film progressed , he became more distant from the audience . his character could have used far more character development -- the film failed to really delve into his life , though and thus left us with a very two-dimensional gangster . you have to wonder why he 's even the protagonist when there 's no sense of his progression throughout the entire film .  even if the character development was poor , pinkie 's character could have still been redeemed if sam riley had a real connection with his character . suffice to say , he did n't . of pinkie brown , rather than connecting with his motivations and understanding what makes his character tick .  however , pinkie is a right treat compared to rose , the waitress he pursues . carey mulligan was originally offered the role of rose , but when she turned it down it was offered to andrea riseborough . rose is a shy , blithering girl who falls in love with pinkie and must fight against what her boss and friends tell her about him . while she starts out very sweet and innocent , the only way to describe her as the film progresses is " more and more irritating " ... seriously . rose falls in love with pinkie after a few days ( more out of desperation and the fact that a man is paying attention to her than genuine ' love ' , in my opinion ) and then becomes a pathetic puppy that follows him around for the rest of the film .  riseborough 's performance was more disconnected than riley 's , and it definitely felt as though her casting in this role was all ( which can not be revealed because they would most definitely be spoilers ) , but for the most part her portrayal of rose was awkward and inconsistent . also , it did n't help that riley and riseborough seemed to have no chemistry at all between them .  the true shining star of the film however , is helen mirren 's character , ida . ida is a wonderful mother figure to rose , while still maintaining sexy streak -- basically , she 's just helen mirren thrown into a gangster flick . perhaps its mirren 's experience , or the fact that her character was probably the most sane ( and least frustrating ) out of the three main characters , but ida made the film 's narrative weaknesses slightly more bearable .  visual/audio  despite the film 's shortcomings , what makes brighton rock beautiful is the visual elements and the soundtrack . from start to finish , the film 's cinematography captured me . the intense contrast in the lighting , the extreme long shots of the scenery , and the general tone of the locations were also brilliantly selected : no matter if it 's a lighthouse on top of a hill or the boardwalk , everything is a delight to look at . the costuming was also beautifully executed , with rose and ida 's clothing being an aesthetically pleasing representation of the setting of the film .  soundtrack-wise , the selections were often unique and definitely captivating . during chase scenes , the music that would belt out would not be fast-paced rock music ; rather , joffe selected a soundtrack with saxophones and drums to add to the film 's jazzy noir atmosphere .  dvd extras  the dvd comes with so many extra goodies , they had to house it in a separate disc ( yes , brighton rock is a two-disc purchase ! ) . with audio commentary from the director and the editor , joe walker , a " making of " segment , extended interviews with joffe , riley , and riseborough , deleted scenes , and even more , there sure is plenty to come back for after the credits have rolled .  final more cons than pros . it 's definitely worth watching if you 're in for a visual treat , but as the narrative gets shakier and pinkie and rose both become irritating , the cinematography can only do so much . the only other reason i could possibly suggest to watch it ( besides for comparison to the original ) is for helen mirren -- i know she 's popular with the gents , and two hours of mirren is worth it no matter how mediocre the film is.
