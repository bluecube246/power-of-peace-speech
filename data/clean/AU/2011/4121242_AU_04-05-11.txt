<h> Trouble in toyland <p> In 2004 , legendary toy maker Lego was an empire in demise . It was riddled with problems and on the brink of collapse . <p> Over the two years to 2004 , sales at the Danish-family owned company dropped 35 per cent worldwide , from 9.6 billion Danish krone ( $1.8 billion ) to 6.3 billion Danish krone . <p> The business was drowning in debt to the tune of 5 billion Danish krone while cash flow was running at negative 1 billion Danish krone . <p> This would be the darkest point in Lego 's history . The group had completely lost its focus . As opposed to manufacturing its famous building bricks , management had become caught up in running Legoland theme parks and licensing deals with film makers to produce merchandise . <p> The business was still run by the family of the founder -- Ole Kirk Christiansen -- and rumours swirled that its larger American rivals such as Mattel were eyeing it for a takeover . <p> The family dug deep and decided to step aside and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new chief executive J ? rgen Vig Knudstorp arrived , he found a business that no longer knew its purpose . <p> " If someone had asked me at that time , ' Why does the Lego group exist ? ' I would not have had a good answer , " he says . <p> When he took over in 2004 , the ex-McKinsey consultant was only 33 . As the head of a high-profile company in trouble , his every move was watched . <p> Today , Knudstorp is a hero in Denmark and Lego group . Sales are up 37 per cent , to 16 billion krone for the last financial year to December 31 . <p> Net profit was up 68 per cent to 2.2 billion krone , the second year running that profit has risen by more than 60 per cent . <p> Lego 's story is one of a classic turnaround , of an iconic toy maker that lost sight of its core business and then found it again . It 's a story full of lessons for any business . <p> Lego was founded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks . But by 1990 , buoyed by that strong brand name , it had branched out into new businesses , theme parks , educational books and a TV series , among others . The three theme parks in the United Kingdom , the United States and Germany were the ultimate representations of this misguided expansion -- they were a huge distraction for management . <p> " They were examples of Lego engaging in a business system that they do n't really understand , " Knudstorp says . " We 'd spread ourselves too thinly , trying to be world champions at too many disciplines . " <p> With management distracted and resources stretched , innovation in Lego 's core Duplo and Lego City products waned . <p> In the toy business , product development is critical . Children want to see new toys on the shelf . For every dollar spent in Australia last year on toys , 55 ? went on new products . <p> When Knudstorp moved into the chief executive 's office , a purge was inevitable . <p> The Legoland parks were among the first assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which immediately folded them into another of its interests , Merlin Entertainment . <p> Lego took a 20 per cent stake in Merlin and Knudstorp took a seat on its board . <p> Lego also shut three manufacturing plants in high-cost countries -- Denmark , Switzerland and the United States -- and had independent operators establish new facilities in Hungary , the Czech Republic and Mexico . <p> These two factors alone halved Lego 's workforce within two years from 10,000 worldwide to 4922 . <p> The timing was fortunate and unfortunate . Fortunate " because we had our financial crisis when the world was going through a boom , it was easier to restructure debt , to sell property and businesses , and lay off people because the unemployment in markets where we laid off people was very low " , Knudstorp says . <p> " The negative was that no one else was doing these sort of things , so we got an inordinate amount of press . " <p> Three years later , Lego would bring most of its manufacturing back in-house and the company 's experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Knudstorp outsourced the manufacturing because he felt it was a commoditised process . However , when the time came to renew the contracts a couple of years later , he realised Lego could operate its manufacturing facilities at far less cost . <p> Its outsourcing partners could n't achieve any efficiency of scale from Lego 's operation : they did n't have a superior manufacturing technique , they could n't secure raw materials at better prices , or offer any flexibility by providing the same service for several clients . <p> The only edge was a lower hourly salary for factory workers which did n't make up for all the other disadvantages . <p> Unlike many of its competitors , Lego manufactures in Europe rather than in China . This , it says , makes it more responsive and means it can get stock to retailers faster , meaning they have to hold less inventory and can increase profit margins on Lego . <p> This resonates with toy buyers at leading stores . John Redenbach , the toy buyer for the Myer retail chain says Myer is making more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having substantially reduced recommended retail prices . <p> " I 'm selling box sizes today for $100 that would have been $149 five years ago and they 're more profitable , " he says . <p> A major aspect of the turnaround was to change Lego 's corporate philosophy . <p> As a private company it had developed an air of secretiveness that rarely spoke to what was and still is an avid fan base . <p> Knudstorp 's decision was to embrace that fan base and become an open source entity . <p> " We made a conscious decision to involve fans in the innovation process , " he says . " I get emails from them directly , I answer them personally . " <p> Ryan McNaught is one such fan . A technology geek for Regency Media by day , McNaught became Australia 's first Lego certified professional last year . <p> Only 13 people in the world have earned this privilege . It entitles McNaught to use a special Lego logo on his designs and get paid for them . <p> " I consider myself like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " McNaught says . " Some of us certified Lego professionals are very artistic , their work is considered art , others are more focused around using it as a tool in terms of architecture . " <p> McNaught has a large scale Lego mosaic of Melbourne property developer Daniel Grollo entered in the Archibald prize for portraiture . <p> From a marketing and innovation point of view , the concept of certified professionals is pure genius . It taps into their love of the product and allows the Lego brand to leverage off it . <p> This Valentine 's Day , McNaught built a 2.2 metre by 2 metre heart from Lego for his wife . It went on display in Melbourne 's botanic gardens before ending up in Myer 's flagship city store as part of a Valentine 's Day promotion . <p> " As a business , Lego would never be able to muster the creativity and energy to do that , " says Lego Australia 's outgoing general manager , Michael Keaton . " The investment in time and energy would be prohibitive . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers . <p> " Early on I discovered that the answers to many of Lego 's problems existed among the employees , " Knudstorp says . <p> Over time , employee engagement has become embedded in Lego 's performance system . Predetermined indicators entitle everyone to a bonus of 10 per cent-plus of their annual salary , contingent upon quality , performance improvements and that the company overall is doing well . " It 's not exactly Wall Street , but it 's quite aggressive by Scandinavian standards , " Knudstorp says . <p> Meanwhile , two-thirds of Knudstorp 's yearly bonus depends on the satisfaction of the retailers worldwide with the offering , services and earnings they make from selling Lego boxes , how likely it is that parents will recommend Lego products to their friends and how engaged Lego staff are . <p> Last December , Lego came to the end of its five-year turnaround strategy and the resurrection has overshot even Knudstorp 's expectations . <p> But there is a peculiar irony in that in the same year Lego finalised its torturous , though ultimately triumphant , journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . <p> By all accounts , the venture has been a success . In five months , Lego snaffled 5 per cent of the large games and puzzles category in Australia , according to research house Gfk . <p> It does , however , bring Lego full circle in more ways than one . <p> The theme parks are expanding -- a new Legoland is under construction in Malaysia . It is developing an online computer game and is again dabbling in TV shows . <p> Lego staff numbers have climbed back up to 2003 levels , which requires the question -- is the iconic toy maker once again straying from its core ? <p> Knudstorp insists that this time it is different . Now Lego is no longer directly involved in the delivery of non-core products . <p> He points to its relationship with Merlin and the Legoland theme parks as a classic example of how Lego is keeping its fingers in many pies but structuring those interests more cleverly . <p> " Theme parks are a great product but not one that Lego can do well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a great product , it looks at who is best suited to deliver it . This key lesson forms the basis of our strategy . " <p> Knudstorp is hopeful that Lego will be his first and last chief executive role . <p> He 's settling in for another seven years at the very least . However , he admits that this calls on him to constantly renew himself and his leadership style . <p> In hindsight , he says the biggest surprise throughout the whole turbulent journey has been the capacity of humans , Lego employees specifically , to exceed expectations . <p> " We always under utilise our potential as human beings , but I think the culture at Lego , the evolution we 've been through has had a catalysing effect on all of us , allowed us to unfold a greater potential than any of us had imagined .
