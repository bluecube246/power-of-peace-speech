trouble in toyland  in 2004 , legendary toy maker lego was an empire in demise . it was riddled with problems and on the brink of collapse .  over the two years to 2004 , sales at the danish-family owned company dropped 35 per cent worldwide , from 9.6 billion danish krone ( $1.8 billion ) to 6.3 billion danish krone .  the business was drowning in debt to the tune of 5 billion danish krone while cash flow was running at negative 1 billion danish krone .  this would be the darkest point in lego 's history . the group had completely lost its focus . as opposed to manufacturing its famous building bricks , management had become caught up in running legoland theme parks and licensing deals with film makers to produce merchandise .  the business was still run by the family of the founder -- ole kirk christiansen -- and rumours swirled that its larger american rivals such as mattel were eyeing it for a takeover .  the family dug deep and decided to step aside and bring new chief executive j ? rgen vig knudstorp arrived , he found a business that no longer knew its purpose .  " if someone had asked me at that time , ' why does the lego group exist ? ' i would not have had a good answer , " he says .  when he took over in 2004 , the ex-mckinsey consultant was only 33 . as the head of a high-profile company in trouble , his every move was watched .  today , knudstorp is a hero in denmark and lego group . sales are up 37 per cent , to 16 billion krone for the last financial year to december 31 .  net profit was up 68 per cent to 2.2 billion krone , the second year running that profit has risen by more than 60 per cent .  lego 's story is one of a classic turnaround , of an iconic toy maker that lost sight of its core business and then found it again . it 's a story full of lessons for any business .  lego was founded in blocks . but by 1990 , buoyed by that strong brand name , it had branched out into new businesses , theme parks , educational books and a tv series , among others . the three theme parks in the united kingdom , the united states and germany were the ultimate representations of this misguided expansion -- they were a huge distraction for management .  " they were examples of lego engaging in a business system that they do n't really understand , " knudstorp says . " we 'd spread ourselves too thinly , trying to be world champions at too many disciplines . "  with management distracted and resources stretched , innovation in lego 's core duplo and lego city products waned .  in the toy business , product development is critical . children want to see new toys on the shelf . for every dollar spent in australia last year on toys , 55 ? went on new products .  when knudstorp moved into the chief executive 's office , a purge was inevitable .  the legoland parks were among the first assets , which immediately folded them into another of its interests , merlin entertainment .  lego took a 20 per cent stake in merlin and knudstorp took a seat on its board .  lego also shut three manufacturing plants in high-cost countries -- denmark , switzerland and the united states -- and had independent operators establish new facilities in hungary , the czech republic and mexico .  these two factors alone halved lego 's workforce within two years from 10,000 worldwide to 4922 .  the timing was fortunate and unfortunate . fortunate " because we had our financial crisis when the world was going through a boom , it was easier to restructure debt , to sell property and businesses , and lay off people because the unemployment in markets where we laid off people was very low " , knudstorp says .  " the negative was that no one else was doing these sort of things , so we got an inordinate amount of press . "  three years later , lego would bring most of its manufacturing back in-house and the company 's experiment .  knudstorp outsourced the manufacturing because he felt it was a commoditised process . however , when the time came to renew the contracts a couple of years later , he realised lego could operate its manufacturing facilities at far less cost .  its outsourcing partners could n't achieve any efficiency of scale from lego 's operation : they did n't have a superior manufacturing technique , they could n't secure raw materials at better prices , or offer any flexibility by providing the same service for several clients .  the only edge was a lower hourly salary for factory workers which did n't make up for all the other disadvantages .  unlike many of its competitors , lego manufactures in europe rather than in china . this , it says , makes it more responsive and means it can get stock to retailers faster , meaning they have to hold less inventory and can increase profit margins on lego .  this resonates with toy buyers at leading stores . john redenbach , the toy buyer for the myer retail chain says myer is making more having substantially reduced recommended retail prices .  " i 'm selling box sizes today for $100 that would have been $149 five years ago and they 're more profitable , " he says .  a major aspect of the turnaround was to change lego 's corporate philosophy .  as a private company it had developed an air of secretiveness that rarely spoke to what was and still is an avid fan base .  knudstorp 's decision was to embrace that fan base and become an open source entity .  " we made a conscious decision to involve fans in the innovation process , " he says . " i get emails from them directly , i answer them personally . "  ryan mcnaught is one such fan . a technology geek for regency media by day , mcnaught became australia 's first lego certified professional last year .  only 13 people in the world have earned this privilege . it entitles mcnaught to use a special lego logo on his designs and get paid for them .  " i consider myself like a , " mcnaught says . " some of us certified lego professionals are very artistic , their work is considered art , others are more focused around using it as a tool in terms of architecture . "  mcnaught has a large scale lego mosaic of melbourne property developer daniel grollo entered in the archibald prize for portraiture .  from a marketing and innovation point of view , the concept of certified professionals is pure genius . it taps into their love of the product and allows the lego brand to leverage off it .  this valentine 's day , mcnaught built a 2.2 metre by 2 metre heart from lego for his wife . it went on display in melbourne 's botanic gardens before ending up in myer 's flagship city store as part of a valentine 's day promotion .  " as a business , lego would never be able to muster the creativity and energy to do that , " says lego australia 's outgoing general manager , michael keaton . " the investment in time and energy would be prohibitive . "  retailers .  " early on i discovered that the answers to many of lego 's problems existed among the employees , " knudstorp says .  over time , employee engagement has become embedded in lego 's performance system . predetermined indicators entitle everyone to a bonus of 10 per cent-plus of their annual salary , contingent upon quality , performance improvements and that the company overall is doing well . " it 's not exactly wall street , but it 's quite aggressive by scandinavian standards , " knudstorp says .  meanwhile , two-thirds of knudstorp 's yearly bonus depends on the satisfaction of the retailers worldwide with the offering , services and earnings they make from selling lego boxes , how likely it is that parents will recommend lego products to their friends and how engaged lego staff are .  last december , lego came to the end of its five-year turnaround strategy and the resurrection has overshot even knudstorp 's expectations .  but there is a peculiar irony in that in the same year lego finalised its torturous , though ultimately triumphant , journey games .  by all accounts , the venture has been a success . in five months , lego snaffled 5 per cent of the large games and puzzles category in australia , according to research house gfk .  it does , however , bring lego full circle in more ways than one .  the theme parks are expanding -- a new legoland is under construction in malaysia . it is developing an online computer game and is again dabbling in tv shows .  lego staff numbers have climbed back up to 2003 levels , which requires the question -- is the iconic toy maker once again straying from its core ?  knudstorp insists that this time it is different . now lego is no longer directly involved in the delivery of non-core products .  he points to its relationship with merlin and the legoland theme parks as a classic example of how lego is keeping its fingers in many pies but structuring those interests more cleverly .  " theme parks are a great product but not one that lego can do well , " as a great product , it looks at who is best suited to deliver it . this key lesson forms the basis of our strategy . "  knudstorp is hopeful that lego will be his first and last chief executive role .  he 's settling in for another seven years at the very least . however , he admits that this calls on him to constantly renew himself and his leadership style .  in hindsight , he says the biggest surprise throughout the whole turbulent journey has been the capacity of humans , lego employees specifically , to exceed expectations .  " we always under utilise our potential as human beings , but i think the culture at lego , the evolution we 've been through has had a catalysing effect on all of us , allowed us to unfold a greater potential than any of us had imagined .
