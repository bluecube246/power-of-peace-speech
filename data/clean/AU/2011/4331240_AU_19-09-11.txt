gamers are a passionate bunch , and will dispute everything . but if anyone ever tries to tell you that super mario 64 was n't a revolutionary game , i want you to goomba-stomp them for me . then run away with your hands over your ears .  having played , finished and loved every single mario platformer nintendo has produced , i was stoked for the opportunity to get my hands on the newest adventure , which we all knew was gon na be awesome anyway . despite the super clunky title , super mario 3d land is likely to be responsible for shifting ludicrous numbers of 3ds systems leading up to christmas .  if you 've played a mario game before -- and i refuse to accept that anyone has n't -- you already know the basics . but there 's more to it than what you expect .  as i started off by saying , mario 64 was a revolution at the time ; the switch to open-world 3d environments was unprecedented , and it sparked a new direction for the could have taken . around the same time , crash bandicoot emerged on the playstation , rejecting the open world design in favour of linear levels that flow like a traditional platformer , while allowing for 3d movement .  super mario 3d land follows crash 's style , so in a way it feels to me like an alternate-reality mario 64 . while the 3d games were fantastic , i always found it hard to get into the flow in an open 3d environment . 3d land reduces the freedom of exploration to create more structured , flowing gameplay . it mostly consists of 2d levels , sidescrolling left to right , with verticality as per usual , but now it allows movement towards and away from the screen . it 's a little hard to explain the significance , but it drastically changes the flow of play : levels usually follow a linear 2d path , allowing a small amount of 3d movement away from that axis . from time to time it will open up into a small open area , before narrowing back onto a single path flow of a 2d platformer but allow multiple pathways , hidden areas and items to be accessible through the background/foreground .  this of course makes it perfect for mario 's transition into the much-hyped third dimension ; with gameplay literally going in and coming out of the screen , it looks and plays brilliantly in 3d . bullet bills fly towards the screen , there 's a new type of piranha plant that spits ink all over your view for a short time , and as nintendo likes to spruik about , it actually is much easier to judge distance in 3d . i was sceptical about the idea , but my cynicism quickly melted away on having tried it . i hate dying in games because i overshoot an enemy or underestimate a gap . that frustration is all but gone , as your distance judgements feel strangely instinctive .  another common gripe people have with 3d platformers is controlling the camera . somehow , the industry has still not quite perfected the method of presenting game worlds in third person . there is no bigger frustration than , or obscures the other side of the gap . mario galaxy tried to remedy this by wrenching the camera from the player 's control at crucial moments , pulling back to give the optimal view of the area and allowing players to focus on the actual task .  super mario 3d land does this the whole time . players are unburdened by camera controls ; rather , your vantage point sits constantly at a perfect isometric angle , like someone 's pulled it up a bit from its usual perch in a 2d platformer . if mario does happen to wander behind some scenery , as he 'll often be enticed to do for hidden items and areas , his silhouette will be visible through it , showing where he is and what he 's doing . think super mario sunshine , without the pointless iris-in effect . we 'll have to trust the designers to not put anything too dangerous back there .  elements of most mario platformers are apparent , but its strongest influence is super mario bros. 3 , arguably the pinnacle of the 2d with a flagpole , complete with a set of stairs or a platform nearby to allow mario to gain some extra points by aiming for the top . the last level of each world takes place on flying airships , and culminate in a boss battle with one of bowser 's kids . and of course , tanooki mario returns .  tanooki mario , the raccoon suit you for some reason collect from a leaf , was iconic to smb3 , but has n't been seen since . its reappearance was one of the first things the world learned about 3d land , when it was revealed in the logo . its use in the new game amounts to pretty much what it did in smb3 -- use it to whap your enemies or coin boxes , or flutter it during a fall to slow your descent . in practise , it unfortunately now has little effect on your falling speed , reducing its usefulness somewhat .  its most useful power in its last appearance was flight . get a decent run up , and you could effectively fly a 3d environment has apparently stumped even the developers . it was announced recently that all tanooki flights have been grounded in super mario 3d land , although it should n't be unreasonable to expect that it still provides a longer or higher jump , with enough speed built up .  i was excited about this game by default , and my time with it has increased that excitement tenfold . screw the third instalments of battlefield , killzone and modern warfare -- this is my most anticipated title for the remainder of 2011 . nintendo never fail to creatively utilise their own hardware ( eventually ) , and super mario 3d land is probably the strongest reason yet to buy a 3ds .  nintendo are stepping up the game now , this looks fantastic , always loved this kind of mario game more than the ( still amazing ) galaxy style titles .  http : **27;256;toolong michael irving  yeah , the linear platform sections in the galaxy games were some of the best parts .  personally , i do n't think the vita has anything been available at or near launch , nintendo probably would n't have had to drop the price and the 3ds would n't have looked like it was n't working .
