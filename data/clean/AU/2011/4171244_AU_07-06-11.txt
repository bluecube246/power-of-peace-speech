<h> Local Real Estate <h> Subscribe Now <p> THE death of a man in a farming accident near Tenterfield has served as a tragic reminder of the dangers of living and working on the land . <p> The man , 90 , was found about 11pm on Monday , pinned under the wheel of his tractor which had rolled in an apple orchard at Cottonvale , about 60km north of Tenterfield . <p> The incident took the number of reported farm-related deaths in NSW to four since the beginning of the year , and to 27 nationally . In 2010 , 44 people died nationally , while a further 68 serious non-fatal injuries were reported . <p> Tractor and quad-bike accidents account for the largest number of injuries and deaths . Of the on-farm deaths recorded in 2010 , 16% were children aged 15 years and under , who died mainly as a result of drowning in dams or in cattle and sheep dips . <p> " These sorts of incidents are tragic , not only for the family , but also the community , " Australian Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We all know that living on the land is a great lifestyle , but it also has its hazards . " <p> Mr Lower said death rates caused by farming accidents had fallen 40% in the past 20 years , but more needed to be done in terms of prevention . <p> " Most of the solutions are things that people are aware of and well familiar with , " he said . <p> " And ( the Cottonvale accident ) does demonstrate that farmers continue to work for much longer than many other occupations , and because of the physical changes that come with aging that does create some additional risks . " <p> To reduce the risk of injury or death , Mr Lower recommended as a minimum rollover prevention structures be installed on all tractors , a crush prevention device be installed on quad-bikes , that farms construct " safe-play " areas for children under the age of five , and anyone operating farm machinery should be properly trained and supervised . <p> National Farm Safety Week , aimed at improving on-farm safety , runs @ @ @
