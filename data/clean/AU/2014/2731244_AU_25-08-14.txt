<h> Gigabyte GB-BXi5G-760 review <p> The gradually emerging category of mini PCs -- inspired largely by Intel 's NUCs -- have been gaining popularity since they first landed a couple of years back . However we 've yet to see any that can tackle a real desktop when it comes to performance -- particularly when it comes to gaming . <p> The new Nvidia- and Intel-powered Gigabyte GB-BXi5G-760 seems to offer the promise of lounge room PC gaming in a box that 's not much bigger than a cereal bowl ( about 13 x 12 x 6cm ) . It 's about a quarter the size of the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony Playstation 4 consoles , but is more graphically powerful that either , with a desktop-grade GeForce GTX 760 graphics card physically reconfigured and squeezed inside the BRIX 's tiny chassis . <p> What you 're getting with the Gigabyte GB-BXi5G-760 is actually a mix of laptop and desktop parts -- leaning rather more in the direction of the former than the latter . In fact , that GTX 760 is really the only desktop part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Core i5-4200U ) , the BYO RAM sticks must be laptop SODIMMs and for storage you can insert either an mSATA or 2.5-inch SSD or hard drive . <p> That gives it more than enough chops for any sort of general-purpose computing you can throw at it , and with an SSD installed for our testing ( a 240GB Seagate SSD 600 ) it booted up in five seconds flat and was lightning fast navigating around the desktop and launching and using productivity and entertainment programs . You could easily use this as a capable little media box to re-encode you movie collection on the fly and stream it to your tablets and phones . <h> Pocket rocket <p> So what about gaming ? The answer there is a little more complex and largely boils down to that Core i5-4200U chip . This is a part usually found in ultrabooks -- it 's a low-power , dual-core CPU that offers OK performance and does n't put out much heat . It 's a far cry from what a desktop chip -- or event a grunt quad-core mobile CPU -- is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove to be a bottleneck games . <p> Compared to a GTX 760 in a desktop rig , the performance was universally lower -- and particularly in the more CPU-bound Metro : Last Light and Tomb Raider tests . At 1080p with Medium details , the Gigabyte GA-BXi5G-760 limped along in Metro at a decidedly unplayable 18 fps ; its desktop counterpart managed 72fps . So while many games are playable at 1080p and maintain a good 60+ fps rate , there are titles that can bring this box to its knees . <p> It 's also worth noting that doing any prolonged gaming will kick the unit 's system fan up into high gear . There 's already a constant low level of fan noise that comes from the Gigabyte GB-BXi5G-760 even when just idling at the desktop , which ramps up quite considerably when games get intensive . The top surface can likewise become quite hot to the touch . <p> Gigabyte does certainly deserve some kudos for managing to squeeze a mid-range desktop graphics card into a box this petit -- this is an interesting experiment that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is OK , with higher-end Intel GPU-powered NUCs selling for around $650 to $700 . Yet we ca n't help but feel that this would 've been a much more well-rounded package if it had been given a faster , quad-core CPU -- even if it was a laptop chip . <p> Verdict : Holds up well in many games , but an imbalance between GPU and CPU throws things off . <h> Rating : 3.5 stars out of 5 <p> I like the concept but the choice of CPU is just silly . It would get sluggish pretty quickly for general computing and every stutter and pause looks much worse on a big panel in a lounge room . I 've got a laptop with a last-generation i7 that only cost $900 and it will power any game well . They do n't need crazy power , just decent power . This unit with a decent CPU and the right price and I 'd be interested as a lounge box that I can throw in a bag for mobile gaming . I 've got an Oculus Rift and a suitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig for the Rift .
