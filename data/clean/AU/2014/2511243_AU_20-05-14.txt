brodie grundy due for a rest - but not just yet  football writer with the age  brodie grundy , while developing as a ruckman has been on the wrong side of the umpires . photo : sebastian costanzo  collingwood will continue to keep a close eye on how brodie grundy is handling his first full season as the club 's first-choice ruckman , and does n't expect him to play every game in the last half of the year .  but the 20-year-old , who will play his 16th game on saturday , is n't ready for a rest yet .  " he 's going well , but we are conscious and very aware of the fact that he will need to be managed at some stage , " said coach nathan buckley .  frees against .  the athletic grundy has teamed mostly with jarrod witts this year , with ben hudson waiting in the vfl and quinten lynch recovering from a broken leg .  advertisement  grundy 's continued improvement has come with just one asterisk - he most in the league .  buckley said grundy and witts were building a good partnership . " i think we 're getting better and better in that regard , and i think the connection between those boys and the midfielders at ground level is improving , ' ' he said .  " the fact we 've just come off a bye helps brodie , so resting him is not in the forefront of our mind at the moment , but i 'd be very surprised if he played 22 games . it will more likely be 19 or 20 and we 'll make those decisions as we go down the track . "  collingwood will consider calling nathan brown back into this week 's side to play west coast , with the defender playing his third game in the vfl last weekend after time off to rest his injured shoulder .  buckley thought defenders jack frost and lachie keeffe were beaten last week , but that his side generally struggled to apply enough defensive pressure to the crows .  " our defence is probably one of said . " the adelaide forward structure asked a few questions of us that we were able to answer early days , but with 60 inside-50s against , you 're going to be in for a pretty tough job .  " we did well to keep adelaide to 76 points given that supply , but brown 's had three weeks back at vfl level and is ready to go if called upon .  " west coast have been playing quite tall at both ends of the field and we 'll have a look at how they want to select their team and what 's working for them , but aerially they 're a great threat .  " we 'll have to consider our back mix to be able to cover that , but they 've got some pretty good ground-level players as well . we 're not under-estimating west coast in any particular aspect . "  alex fasolo missed training on tuesday for management reasons but will train later in the week and play , while ben reid is still some time off returning from a calf back into the side .  " he 'll need another week-and-a-half of full training , and he 's had two or three really solid sessions now , but all along i 've been really loath to be too specific , because you actually ca n't progress to the next stage until you 've got through this one , " buckley said .  " talking to reidy , he 's really confident about where his body is , and the work that he 's been able to do in the last two or three weeks in particular . we 've been scanning it consistently to understand the progression of the injury , and that 's going to be good not just for reidy but any other players in that situation .  " we can give reidy more time . we 'll give him as much time as he likes because when he gets back we 'd like him to stay back and be a significant part of the second part of our year . "
