The Year 5 and 6 children were encouraged to share their observations and hopes for their home town by the Belonging Project 's Jennifer Winfield , a cultural consultant using " circle work " communication and indigenous story-telling techniques .  Community figures such as fifth generation resident Lynn Smith told of swimming in the park 's weir as a child , launching corrugated iron canoes into the water rich with wildlife .  Big Scrub president Tony Parkes talked about forest regeneration , and suggested the children join a Landcare group to learn how best to plant trees .  A Lend Lease rep emphasised the care the company had taken to protect the endangered giant barred frog in its construction of the tunnel and new highway near the town .  The children 's vision included restoring the weir , creating a nature walk and building as retaining the town 's popular events such as the billycart derby and Christmas Eve street party .  Their vision will be translated into a colourful mural within the park by artist Samantha Wortelhock .  Co-ordinator Terry Bleakley said the circles in the parklands were a resource for all the community to use in various ways , including for educational events or weddings .  " They present a wonderful opportunity for teachers to take their classes outdoors once in a while to help the children connect with the natural world . "
