<p> In 1919 , Ivy MacKusick , an art student at UCL 's Slade School of Fine Art , completed a Portrait of a Man in His Shirtsleeves . We know nothing about the man of African descent depicted in this portrait . It was painted during the inaugural year of the Harlem Renaissance , which was also a year of violent race riots in the United States and Britain . The evocative painting makes it hard not to speculate about the thoughts passing through the man 's mind as he sat for the Slade students . <p> Had he lost a child or other family members in the recent Great War ? Perhaps he was a dockworker and had experienced the extreme racial violence on the streets of East London during 1919 . Or one of the many students of African and Asian heritage at University College . Perhaps he was linked to the presence of American performers in London 's West End ? Either way , he may have joined the audiences at those theatres to see the popular African American performer Florence Mills . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be surprising if he had n't . Mills was then the star of Blackbirds , a series of musical and dance numbers interspersed with comedy sketches that , following a successful run in Paris , enthralled audiences at the London Pavilion on Piccadilly Circus . For a time Blackbirds mania took hold of popular British cultural life . <p> The show turned Mills into a celebrity . Her recipe for a New Orleans Christmas Loaf was included in a compilation of yuletide recipes from famous stars in the Nottingham Evening Post . She combined this celebrity lifestyle with a commitment to anti-racist politics and ordinary people . She took part in special performances for wounded servicemen , charity performances for the Hackney Children 's Hospital and North London Jewish schools . She became an inspiration to black Londoners . <p> Jacob Epstein , The Little Negress , 1928 . Tate <p> But things were n't always so . Born in Washington DC in January 1895 , Mills was considered one of the leading performers of the Harlem Renaissance -- and was one of the few African American vaudeville performers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain for the first time in 1923 , the news that an all-black cast was going to be performing in London outraged the actors ' and musicians unions , which complained to the London County Council . <p> The compromise the authorities settled on reflects well the hardening and officially endorsed racial prejudice of the colour bar in inter-war Britain . Mills and her African-American colleagues did perform , but unions successfully insisted that an all-white British cast performed in the first half of the show . Mills and the rest of the cast were only allowed in the second half . This ruling did n't quite have the desired effect , as most reviewers preferred the performance of Mills and her company . The energy and talents of the American cast upstaging their fellow British performers . <h> Harlem in London <p> A decade later , celebrities like Mills were n't quite so few and far between . In March 1936 Rudolph Dunbar wrote his essay on the influence of Black America on London . He reported on the presence of black performers , students and actors and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience a slice of " Harlem in London " . <p> But this " Harlem in London " scene was romanticised for many . For the Jamaican born activist Claude McKay , whose despairing response to the race riots in 1919 was poured into his poem If We Must Die , the inequalities of imperialism , racism and class struggle remained insurmountable hurdles for a black man in early ' 20s Britain . <p> Barbara Ker-Seymer and Burra wrote about trips to Blackbird shows in their letters to each other , as did many ordinary fans . Among them , a " Madame Davis " , who wrote to Mills in 1926 from her home in Holborn . In her letter , Davis shared her pride at having seen a black woman on stage singing like a nightingale and proving that black women , like her , were able to perform as well , indeed better , than their white peers . Mills was among London 's first celebrities to challenge racism . <p> These fan letters , although brief , speak to a number of broader themes explored in Tate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardening of racism and " the colour line " in Britain between the wars are explored , along with the importance of the arts , particularly popular culture , in the formation of black identities and challenges to racism . What is also made abundantly clear is the important role of black cultural expression in the making of British popular culture in its broadest sense in the 1920s and 1930s.
