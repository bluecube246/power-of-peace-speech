" about 7 or 8 years ago we went to john campbell , who was the council for the doboy water at that stage , and said , that we 'd love to have a park that we could develop . "  " he pointed me to and area of land which is off the end of poppy street which comes off lytton road where all the coal stores are  " the aim of the exercise once we saw that was to create a fishing park , " continued benham , " and the reason for that was of course to take the people who fish on the doboy bridge away from there because that 's a very dangerous environment , and then give them an area where they could fish in the same creek . "  people do n't usually get parks named after them unless they 're dead !  bill described what the park would consist of .  " there will be fishing benches there , there 's a fish cleaning bench , there 's covered picnic areas , walkways , there 's going to be a boardwalk over a marine environment area where the water comes in every tide , so the kids will be able to stand on the boardwalk and simply look down and watch crabs and fish and all the marine growth around the place . "  ryan murphy is the councillor for the ward of doboy , and he joined in the discussion .  clare asked murphy what will be called bill benham parklands .  " we were thinking about names for the park , " explained murphy , " and we were going over the local pineers , and obviously there was william hemmant , who the suburb was named after and we thought , who 's done more work than any people to make this park a reality -- and it was bill !
