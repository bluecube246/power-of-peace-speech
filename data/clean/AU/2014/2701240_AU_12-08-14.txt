broker targeted by charlatan insurance intermediary  a nsw broker has made a complaint to the office of fair trading after an overseas telemarketing company impersonating his businesses contacted private individuals .  orion insurance services received a complaint from an individual that the company had called him . the unknown telemarketer called from a blocked number , pretending to be orion , and hung up as soon as the recipient said he is on the australian communications and media authority do not call register .  robert fleming , managing director of orion insurance services , told insurance business orion does not engage with telemarketers and only works with businesses . he has made a complaint to the office of fair trading , which passed it on to the australian competition and consumer commission , which is now investigating it . meanwhile , fleming has posted warnings on social media about the imposters .  he said the brokerage does not deal with telemarketers or private individuals . he spoke of his frustration that the intellectual property rights of his name have been used to further question is how long has this been going on . i do n't know if it 's a one-off or has been going for a while . i 've only had one phone call so maybe it 's a one-off and wo n't be repeated .  " it 's a little bit concerning . it sounds like it was an overseas company as the number is blocked and they hung up as soon as he said he is on the do-not-call register . i do n't think my business partners and clients will get such a call .  " the person that was targeted was a private individual . the people i deal with know i only deal with business insurance and i deal with particular subsets -- professional indemnity and liability , which would not require me to call them . "  my elderly mother-in-law received two unsolicited calls from a telemarketer in the last few days saying they represent orion insurance . the first time they called she stated that she was on a do not call ( dnc ) register but they went on to again even after her advise .  karyn lensonon 27/08/2014 11:55:27 am  i have had 2 calls this week from " orion insurance " about funeral insurance . it 's a private number and sounds like it 's overseas . they ask for mrs lenson and hang up if i mention the do not call register .  robert flemingon 3/10/2014 12:25:26 pm  i am the owner of orion insurance . as i made reference too in the piece above , this is not me , i have not authorised any telemarketers . they have stolen my company name . i have tried to pursue it further with nsw fair trading but have come up against a brick wall as i do n't have any information on the company who are making the calls .  i am sorry for anyone 's inconvenience , but please know that orion insurance do not use telemarketers .  philip cumpstonon 1/04/2015 12:31:54 pm  repeated calls from scammers over the last two weeks . is there any way to trace these calls and find the group involved ? the latest was @ @ @ @
