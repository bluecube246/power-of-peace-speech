opinion : koala trees replace valuable habitat  in the past 12 months alone council has purchased 400ha of environmentally significant land for $5.7 million , including sites at mt ninderry , cambroon , ilkley and the doonan creek environment reserve at verrierdale .  there was a really good example of that principle last week when koalas at sunshine coast council 's doonan creek environmental reserve were given a helping hand .  the federally funded bruce hwy project connecting frizzo rd with sippy creek rd at palmview will be a much-valued economic and community asset .  but there will be an environmental cost as the road works are in an area mapped as a koala habitat .  to offset that cost the state government is paying for suitable trees to be planted at the doonan creek site - five for every one cut down in palmview .  funds of $970,000 will provide koala habitat on 9.3ha of the 252ha environmental reserve , including planting and maintenance over the next five years .  council purchased the reserve with environment levy funds in important wetland areas left in the region .  in the past 12 months alone council has purchased 400ha of environmentally significant land for $5.7 million , including sites at mt ninderry , cambroon , ilkley and the doonan creek environment reserve at verrierdale .  these sites when combined create a corridor of conservation that is emblematic of council 's desire to preserve and protect our natural heritage for future generations . the equation does n't have to be environment or economy or community - you can have all three . in fact , that 's the only way we can become the most sustainable region in australia .  also this week i 'd like to mention sustainable partnerships australia , which was formerly known as the sunshine coast youth partnership in maroochydore .  at a time when youth unemployment is a concern to many , this organisation is doing an outstanding job as a leading provider of education , career and transition projects to young people .
