<h> OPINION : Koala trees replace valuable habitat <p> In the past 12 months alone council has purchased 400ha of environmentally significant land for $5.7 million , including sites at Mt Ninderry , Cambroon , Ilkley and the Doonan Creek Environment Reserve at Verrierdale . <p> There was a really good example of that principle last week when koalas at Sunshine Coast Council 's Doonan Creek Environmental Reserve were given a helping hand . <p> The federally funded Bruce Hwy project connecting Frizzo Rd with Sippy Creek Rd at Palmview will be a much-valued economic and community asset . <p> But there will be an environmental cost as the road works are in an area mapped as a koala habitat . <p> To offset that cost the State Government is paying for suitable trees to be planted at the Doonan Creek site - five for every one cut down in Palmview . <p> Funds of $970,000 will provide koala habitat on 9.3ha of the 252ha environmental reserve , including planting and maintenance over the next five years . <p> Council purchased the reserve with environment levy funds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important wetland areas left in the region . <p> In the past 12 months alone council has purchased 400ha of environmentally significant land for $5.7 million , including sites at Mt Ninderry , Cambroon , Ilkley and the Doonan Creek Environment Reserve at Verrierdale . <p> These sites when combined create a corridor of conservation that is emblematic of council 's desire to preserve and protect our natural heritage for future generations . The equation does n't have to be environment or economy or community - you can have all three . In fact , that 's the only way we can become the most sustainable region in Australia . <p> Also this week I 'd like to mention Sustainable Partnerships Australia , which was formerly known as the Sunshine Coast Youth Partnership in Maroochydore . <p> At a time when youth unemployment is a concern to many , this organisation is doing an outstanding job as a leading provider of education , career and transition projects to young people .
