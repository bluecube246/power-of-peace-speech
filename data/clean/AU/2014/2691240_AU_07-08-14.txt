mark thompson yet to make decision regarding afl coaching future  as his veterans start making their intentions clear on 2015 , essendon coach mark thompson has far more important things to worry about .  jason winderlich announced on wednesday that this afl season would be his last , a decision that surprised thompson given the 29-year-old 's form .  paul chapman , who will turn 33 in november , has made it clear he wants to play on but dustin fletcher has yet to say whether he wants to feature in a stunning 23rd afl season during which the defender will turn 40 and likely pass the 400-game milestone .  thompson is set to hand the reins back to club icon james hird when the current season ends and the two-time premiership coach 's plans are unknown beyond that .  will he stay at essendon ? will he even stay in the afl ?  " i 'm not giving it too much thought . they 're busy days and you do n't actually get too much time to think about it do n't want to distract away from what i 'm doing .  " as a club we wanted it not to be a gap year , and it 's not . we 're still alive with a lot of improvement up our sleeves . "  thompson said it had been a " long year " for everyone in the the industry , but that he was enjoying the final stretch .  " if you 're still a chance and ( your season is ) still alive , then you can jump out of bed and come to work and do whatever you have to do to get through , " he added .  " i 'm quite excited about the challenge . "  that was evident at the pre-match media conference for friday night 's clash with richmond , with thompson at his wisecracking and whimsical best .  " i was surprised . i think he 's playing fantastic footy . but i 'm not with him when he tries to get out of bed every morning , " he said of winderlich 's retirement 's all amicable . "  thompson suggested the club would not attempt to influence fletcher , who will miss the game against the tigers due to groin and finger injuries .  " that 's up to dustin , it 's not up to us , " he said .  " he 's got to make that decision himself . we 'll leave it completely up to him . "
