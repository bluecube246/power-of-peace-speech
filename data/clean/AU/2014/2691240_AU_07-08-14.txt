<h> Mark Thompson yet to make decision regarding AFL coaching future <p> As his veterans start making their intentions clear on 2015 , Essendon coach Mark Thompson has far more important things to worry about . <p> Jason Winderlich announced on Wednesday that this AFL season would be his last , a decision that surprised Thompson given the 29-year-old 's form . <p> Paul Chapman , who will turn 33 in November , has made it clear he wants to play on but Dustin Fletcher has yet to say whether he wants to feature in a stunning 23rd AFL season during which the defender will turn 40 and likely pass the 400-game milestone . <p> Thompson is set to hand the reins back to club icon James Hird when the current season ends and the two-time premiership coach 's plans are unknown beyond that . <p> Will he stay at Essendon ? Will he even stay in the AFL ? <p> " I 'm not giving it too much thought . They 're busy days and you do n't actually get too much time to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to distract away from what I 'm doing . <p> " As a club we wanted it not to be a gap year , and it 's not . We 're still alive with a lot of improvement up our sleeves . " <p> Thompson said it had been a " long year " for everyone in the the industry , but that he was enjoying the final stretch . <p> " If you 're still a chance and ( your season is ) still alive , then you can jump out of bed and come to work and do whatever you have to do to get through , " he added . <p> " I 'm quite excited about the challenge . " <p> That was evident at the pre-match media conference for Friday night 's clash with Richmond , with Thompson at his wisecracking and whimsical best . <p> " I was surprised . I think he 's playing fantastic footy . But I 'm not with him when he tries to get out of bed every morning , " he said of Winderlich 's retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all amicable . " <p> Thompson suggested the club would not attempt to influence Fletcher , who will miss the game against the Tigers due to groin and finger injuries . <p> " That 's up to Dustin , it 's not up to us , " he said . <p> " He 's got to make that decision himself . We 'll leave it completely up to him . "
