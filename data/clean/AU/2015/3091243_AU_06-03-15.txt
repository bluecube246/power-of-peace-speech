Ex-Age Of Empires Devs Announce Servo , A New Robot-Powered RTS  The popularity of Homeworld Remastered goes to show that you can never get enough sci-fi real-time strategy games . Many genre stalwarts have fallen over the years , so it 's refreshing when veteran developers get a second chance -- in this case BonusXP , made up of ex-Ensemble people and its new mech-flavoured title , Servo .  The idea is you unlock slot-based upgrades for your mechs as you progress , with a " dozen-plus " compartments providing a great deal of customisation opportunities .  The main campaign , which consists of 25 missions , tells the tale of the human race , having abandoned Earth many years ago , returning to their home in search of " Bloom " . This valuable resource is also a plague of sorts and the description is reminiscent of C&amp;C 's tiberium .  Multiplayer will be in the form of player-versus-player , or cooperative combat against waves of baddies . More details about the game can be found in the clip above , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
