Making sense of Australia's foreign actor visa dispute

If Meryl Streep were to come to Australia to make another film with Fred Schepisi , as she did in 1988 with Evil Angels ( based on the Lindy Chamberlain story ) , there would be few complaints .  Even if the production benefited from government subsidies , it would still be an Australian story , with an Australian director , mostly Australian cast and crew , and filmed in Australia -- all of it made that bit more sellable to the world thanks to the presence of a bona fide international star .  What 's not to love about that ?  Advertisement  ( Meryl Streep , as Lindy Chamberlain in Evil Angels , would be welcome back . All her American mates ? Maybe not so much . )  But if Meryl Streep were to make the same film here with a bunch of other Americans in the lead roles , it would be a different story . Opportunities for our talent to shine would have been lost -- or , if you prefer , stolen -- and many people would a project .  Why is this a hot topic right now ?  In a discussion paper released in January , the government flagged its desire to simplify the Temporary Work ( Entertainment ) visa ( Subclass 420 ) , in line with its commitment to " reducing the burden and cost of unnecessary or inefficient regulation " .  The union representing actors and crew , the Media , Entertainment and Arts Alliance , opposed the mooted changes , arguing that " taxpayer funds should not go towards paying foreign stars " and that " it is an important cultural objective to tell Australian stories with Australian faces and voices on screen " .  Independent senator Nick Xenophon agreed . " If these regulations are removed it would probably be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre , because that 's the effect it will have on Australian actors and crew , " he said .  ( Actress Susie Porter , at right with Puberty Blues co-stars Dan Wyllie and Brenna Harding , has argued against the mooted changes . " Local actors like me need every possible opportunity to " It 's how we get our training , it 's how we make a name for ourselves , it 's how we tell Australian stories . " )  How does it work now ?  As it stands , the ability of a producer to import foreign actors is strictly limited . The bigger the budget and the greater the proportion of it raised from overseas the more leeway there is , but generally speaking it is extremely hard to make a case for more than one lead role , one supporting role and one cameo going to overseas actors in any film receiving government subsidies .  Crucially , the union must be consulted on any proposed imports , a condition that does not apply to any other class of visa ( but one justified , the union says , on the grounds of the cultural significance of the sector ) .  What changes are being proposed ?  The key changes being considered are that ministerial sign-off would no longer be needed and that the union would no longer be consulted .  Removing the need end the cap on the number of foreign actors allowed into the country to work on a production .  The union says that will mean fewer opportunities for Australian actors .  ( Sarah Snook in her breakout role in Predestination . It 's not hard to imagine that the role might have gone to an American had the rules been different . )  The case of Sarah Snook , for example , might be illustrative . The rising star delivered a career-making performance in Predestination , opposite American actor Ethan Hawke . But if there had been no limits on foreign actors , would she even have landed the role ? Given its budget ( north of $7 million ) , setting ( the US ) , and source material ( a short story by an American science-fiction writer ) there is every possibility the role might have gone to an American actress instead .  On the other hand , the producers say lifting the limits on foreign actors will make it much easier to raise finance from overseas ( because a name recognised beyond these shores a chance of appealing to audiences beyond these shores ) , and that as a result more content will be made , which inevitably means there will be more jobs for Australian actors and crew .  Some actors agree with them too : Roy Billing has written " we actors need to look past the narrow thinking of our union and its current leadership , and our own selfishness , and consider the added work opportunities that more production would give to ... that myriad group of workers whose names appear in the credits at the end of a film " .  Who is right ?  It 's hard to say because so much of this is about trying to predict the unpredictable . Clearly , though , there are vested interests on both sides . The union does n't want to be dealt out of its position of influence , and it does have legitimate concerns about the erosion of the cultural imperative that underpins government support of the sector ( and if the cultural argument is weakened , it 's not a massive stretch to see can no longer be justified ) .  It 's worth noting that the union does not have a right of veto , despite the impression some on the other side have tried to create ; it can only make recommendations in support of or against an application .  In 2013-14 , the Arts Minister issued certificates for 114 foreign actors ( the visas themselves are granted by the Immigration Minister ) . MEAA director Zoe Angus says the union raised concerns on " maybe half a dozen occasions " ( including applications for crew , for whom more than 2000 visas were issued ) , and says it objected to just one application for a foreign actor . " And that was rolled by the minister . "  But the other side has a point too : producers object to having to pay the MEAA a consultation fee ( $550 an application ) and to the 14-day turnaround to process it . " Putting a deal together to make a film , it all has to come together in a lightning moment , " says SPA chief Matthew n't nail it down straight away , you 're just better moving on to some place that can . "  Is there a middle ground ?  Maybe , but no one seems to have raised it yet .  It 's possible to envisage a scheme that grants a little more flexibility to producers but still imposes limits on the number of foreign actors a production can employ . It might no longer need the Arts Minister to sign off on deals . It might be administered by a new or existing agency or by the Immigration Department instead .  The union might need to concede some ground , too . Foxtel suggested in its submission that " the union could be involved in periodic reviews ( perhaps every three years ) of the use of overseas talent in Australian productions " . That 's unlikely to wash with the MEAA or with those concerned that the floodgates are about to open , but it 's hard to see a way forward without some sort of compromise .  ( Australian actors rallied in July 2011 against the Australian films . From left to right : Equity chief Simon Whipp , Gerrard Kennedy , Terry Norris , John Flaus and Terry Donovan . )  Back then , producer Antony Ginnane , whose three-year term as president of the Screen Producers Association had just ended , claimed the actors ' union was " frightened , heading for the hills , and it 's our job to get out there and shoot them down " .  There might be some in the government 's ranks who hold the same view , but the best outcome for the industry is likely to come from a rather more considered position than that .
