<p> Using her newly developed punching power instead of her famed armbar , Rousey knocked out challenger Bethe Correia 34 seconds into their Ultimate Fighting Championship bantamweight title bout in Brazil on Saturday night ( local time ) . <p> Rousey ( 12-0 ) has now won 11 of her 12 fights in the first round , and she has ended her last four in 34 seconds , 14 seconds , 16 seconds and 66 seconds . <p> Advertisement <p> Rousey kept the fight a stand-up battle and first hurt Correia significantly with a big right hand , followed by a hard left punch to the face . She then landed a knee to the body , then finished Correia with a short right hand to the temple . <p> Correia ( 9-1 ) slumped to the mat , unresponsive , as referee John McCarthy signalled the bout was over . <p> " I planned not to force it ... she went for the clinch , and could n't ... I guess you ca n't doubt my hands anymore , " Rousey said in the octagon afterward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio de Janeiro , fiercely striding to the octagon while wearing the Brazilian flag like a cape behind her . <p> But her performance could n't match that apparent rage , and she briefly tumbled backward while struggling to find Rousey and avoid a fight on the mat with the 2008 Olympic judo bronze medallist . <p> Rousey expressed outrage when Correia said in the lead-up to the fight that she hoped the champion would n't commit suicide if she lost , talk Rousey thought went below the belt considering her father committed suicide . <p> In the co-main event , light-heavyweight Antonio Rogerio Nogueira blasted former champion Mauricio " Shogun " Rua with a slew of wicked left-handed punches late in the first round , wobbling Rua . <p> But Rua rallied in the second by keeping Nogueira backed to the canvas for most of the round , then whipped in some body kicks in the third . Nogueira sought a deciding chokehold in the third , but Rua slipped away . <p> Judges gave Rua ( 23-10 ) a 29-28 unanimous-decision victory on all three scorecards . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by decision . <p> " I did feel that punch , was a bit groggy for a while , but I just had to recuperate , " Rua said in the octagon afterward . " I won . I got the victory . " <p> Struve , the tallest fighter in the UFC at 6-foot-11 , avoided the 39-year-old Nogueira 's submission attempts and relied on his massive reach advantage to subject Nogueira to big rights and hurtful jabs en route to the unanimous decision . <p> Brazil 's Claudia Gadelha , the No.1 contender in the women 's strawweight division , showed the wide divide that exists between her and No. 15 Jessica Aguilar by repeatedly landing punches and left kicks to the head in the first round , leaving Aguilar 's nose bloodied . The punishment continued until judges awarded Gadelha ( 13-1 ) a victory by unanimous decision without one lost round .
