<h> The future of Mein Kampf in a meme world <h> Author <p> Professor of History and Director of the Undergraduate Program in Judaic Studies , Fairfield University <h> Disclosure statement <p> Gavriel D Rosenfeld does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Seventy-five years ago , in his autobiographical volume Hitler and I ( 1940 ) , the one-time Nazi party member and later renegade , Otto Strasser , offered up a frank reminiscence about Hitler 's infamous book , Mein Kampf . Strasser was dining with several high-ranking Nazi officials at the 1927 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg when he was asked if he had ever read Hitler 's notorious treatise . <p> Strasser replied : <p> " I admitted having quoted some significant passages from it without bothering my head about the context . This caused general amusement , and it was agreed that the first person who joined us who had read Mein Kampf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother and a leading party member 's answer was a resounding ' No , ' Goebbels shook his head guiltily , Goering burst into loud laughter , and Count Reventlow excused himself on the ground that he had had no time . Nobody had read Mein Kampf , so everybody had to pay his own bill . " <p> While historians have long debated how many Germans actually read Mein Kampf during the Third Reich , today a different question has arisen : will anyone in Germany read it once it can be legally published there in early 2016 ? And what might be the impact on a digital generation for whom the F ? hrer is a distant memory or internet meme ? <p> Later this year , the official copyright for Mein Kampf expires -- 70 years after the demise of its author . Since 1945 , the Bavarian State ( which owns the copyright ) has refused to allow anyone to publish the volume . But in expectation of the copyright 's expiration ( and in the hope of getting a jump on neo-Nazis who may try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the esteemed Munich and Berlin-based Institute for Contemporary History decided some years ago to publish its own , critically annotated version . The move has generated some opposition , with some arguing against the release of any new version ; " Can you annotate the Devil ? " one critic asks . <p> The question is whether anyone will have the strength to lift , let alone read , the new edition . The volume will be hefty , numbering more than 2,000 pages -- the result of nearly 5,000 annotations supplied by scholars . These annotations will critically engage Hitler 's ideologically rooted claims in Mein Kampf , the goal being to prevent gullible readers from accepting any of them at face value . <h> Who will read the new edition of Mein Kampf ? <p> Neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists will surely shy away from this new volume . But what about younger Germans who may simply be curious about the book ? To be sure , they -- like all German readers -- have been able to access used and online versions of Mein Kampf for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German law ) thanks to Internet vendors . But if they have n't found their way to a version of the book by now , will they be tempted to look at the forthcoming edition ? <p> Perhaps some will . But the likelihood is that the weighty tome will appeal to very few who belong to the millennial generation . Younger Germans , like their peers worldwide , have grown up reading brief Twitter Feeds and Facebook posts . When browsing the web , their attention spans , if estimates are to be believed , run to less than thirty seconds per website . Moreover , they have been exposed to countless examples of the " Hitler Meme , " in the form of irreverent images that spoof the former F ? hrer , in the form of satirical videos on YouTube , websites like Cats That Look Like Hitler , and online games like Six Degrees of Hitler . Today 's youth culture , in short , is accustomed to superficially mocking , rather than deeply engaging , with Hitler and his legacy . <p> For this reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-issuing of Mein Kampf probably need n't worry . Indeed , in important ways , the book runs counter the essential dynamics of present-day web culture , <p> My new book , Hi Hitler ! highlights my research into the increasingly common commercialization and normalization of the Nazi past . I argue that a new internet rule has recently come into being , which I term the " Law of Ironic Hitlerization . " It asserts that the likelihood of an image getting attention on the web increases as soon as a Hitler moustache , swastika , or any other Nazi iconography is applied to it . For those brave enough , doing a brief image search on Google will turn up endless images of otherwise blameless characters -- Hello Kitty , Colonel Sanders , the Teletubbies -- who have fallen victim to this dynamic . <p> In all likelihood , however , Mein Kampf will resist the " Law of Ironic Hitlerization . " Unless intrepid web users can devise a way to " Hitlerize " -- that is , to affix Nazi iconography to -- Mein Kampf 's textual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many readers , will be akin to stumbling upon a fossil .
