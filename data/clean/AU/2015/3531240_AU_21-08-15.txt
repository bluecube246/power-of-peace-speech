<h> When 70% of the seafood we eat is imported and not properly labelled , the Australian government needs to act <p> I live not far from the water . Water in which you can catch flathead , that iconic Australian fish that most of us have pulled in on a line since we were kids . <p> And yet the two nearest takeaways to me that sell " flathead " do n't sell anything from those waters . Instead , the so-called flathead should , by rights , be called " Argentinian stickfish " ( the scientific name is percophis brasiliensis ) if it was labelled accurately . <p> Now , the fact so many takeaways sell imported fish and rebrand it using misleading names was news to me a couple of years back , and it 's still news to most people . <p> In fact , studies suggest nearly 3/4 of people assume seafood sold in Australian restaurants , cafes and takeaways is local . They assume that if it 's not from the body of water closest to the diner , then at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows those who have something to hide to keep it that way . <p> Despite local fishers , markets , importers and wholesalers being required to have accurate fish names and to give the origins of their seafood , the hospitality industry does n't . They can be sneaky and make up names for fish . They can call anything " fish " when you ca n't simply call any warm-blooded animal flesh " mammal " or feathered animal " bird " . <p> They can obscure the origins of the seafood they use because the law , as it stands , exempts what 's known as ready-to-eat seafood -- any seafood cooked and sold outside the home . <p> Some may know this already . I 've spent more than two years of lobbying , agitating , hearing the stories from local fishers about how their seafood ca n't compete with mislabelled and misrepresented products , and trying to get legislative change so we , as consumers , can know exactly what seafood is on our plates . <p> But the Australian Senate is unmoved . I 'm not against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in my mouth , and the first step in that process is to be told what you 're eating . Certified sustainable fisheries , and those with a good news story from anywhere in the world , should welcome consumers being informed . <p> Yes , we did help get a Senate Committee to look into seafood labelling . Yes , the committee did recommend country of origin labelling be extended to all seafood sold in Australia . And yes , I 've met so many responsible professional fishers who have been so excited that the regulations they meet -- to properly sort , label and record their catch accurately -- could be passed on to the consumer . <p> But last week , the Australian Senate knocked back a bill put up by South Australian senator Nick Xenophon to transform the labelling of ready-to-eat seafood : the fish at your takeaway or sushi joint , the prawns on your pizza . <p> So , restaurants , cafes , bistros and takeaways can still call any fish simply " fish " , and not say exactly what it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Or call Argentinian stickfish " flathead " , even though it 's no relation of flathead , and do it with impunity . <p> When I sent a list of questions to Senator Richard Colbeck , parliamentary secretary to the minister for agriculture , who represents not just me as a Tasmanian , but the entire fishing industry in Australia , his response was less than emphatic . I did n't even receive a form letter . In fact , I 've yet to receive any response at all . <p> I know most consumers would like to know where their fish is from , even if they have someone else cook it . <p> They 'd like to know what they 're putting in their mouths . Evidence from the NT has shown seafood sales skyrocketed when the Territory government brought in country of origin labelling for seafood in restaurants . And profits also soared . <p> I 've been on the fishing boats . I 've seen environmental pillaging . I 've witnessed the great , the good , and the awful . I really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know some of you do too . And the first step in that journey is to be told what 's on the plate . <p> Not knowing is bad for the environment . It 's bad for the consumer and it 's bad for those responsible fishers who do the right thing , both here and abroad . <p> I 've fought for legislative change , because the voluntary system of labelling seafood has failed . Laws are there to protect us from the shonks and charlatans , not from the good and noble . But for now , thanks to both our major parties ( who ignored the advice of their own committee ) , we are still at the mercy of those who have something to hide , not something to share . <p> The public expect more . The seafood industry expect more . But until we see real change and accurate labelling , ready-to-eat seafood will continue to be a little fishy . <p> If you expect more , sign this Change.org petition I 've started calling on the Australian Parliament to amend the legislation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of origin for all seafood sold in Australia . <p> * Matthew Evans is a former restaurant critic who moved to Tasmania to try his hand at farming , a career change that featured in the SBS series Gourmet Farmer .
