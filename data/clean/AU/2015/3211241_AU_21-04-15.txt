there is already a brilliant parody of dove 's latest ' real beauty ' ad , switching the focus to men and their penis size  dove 's " campaign for real beauty " has been running for more than a decade now , with each new ad highlighting women 's lack of self confidence about their appearance , and how they will feel better about themselves if they accept they are beautiful . the well-trodden storyline means the campaign is ripe fodder for parody .  and that 's exactly what comedy troupe funny or die has done this month , re-working dove 's latest #choosebeautiful ad , where women around the world are presented with a choice of walking through two doors : one that has a sign above it reading " beautiful , " and another reading " average . "  in funny or die 's treatment of the ad , which we first spotted on adweek , the video switches the focus to men and asks them to choose between two doors marked " average d*** , " or " big d*** the men opt for the " big d*** " door . one guy who chose " average " says : " i walked through the door that said ' average d*** ' and i did n't really feel good about that , because i was n't telling being truthful . "  another man describes his " 20.3 cm " member as like " big ben , " while another ponders the universal question of what an " average d*** " really is : " are we talking width ? are we talking length ? are we talking girth ? are we talking weight ? because , quite frankly , weight is really all i got . "  the parody video aped the real ad by featuring women who had been invited into a lab setting to take part in an experiment , with what turned out to be a pseudo-scientist . the scientist then leaves the room , leaving the participants with nothing to do but look in the mirror , only to find a man in a gorilla suit staring back at them .  the video concludes psychology experiment , and it showed you you 're not actually a hideous monster . so where 's our nobel peace prize or whatever ?
