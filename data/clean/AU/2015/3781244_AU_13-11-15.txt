" Jamie has been part of the club for ten years , and I have watched her grow . She has an empathy of others and a desire to work for them . "  Seddio noted Williams has also run a domestic violence prevention program , and received a master 's degree from Fordham , all while raising said she was thrilled and overjoyed to have earned the club 's support .  " Come to me with your ideas , offer me your advice , treat me like a friend , " she said , adding that in her role as Persaud 's chief of staff she has had the great opportunity to both work with Persaud and learn about the community .  " Public Service is an honor , " said Williams . " I need you to be there for me , I can not do this by myself , we need each other . As the TJ Club has taught me , we are a team . "  While Williams received the endorsement , it remains unclear if Gov . Cuomo will call a special election for the seat as she would have to run in the primary again in September -- less than a year away .  While a Democrat is all but assured to win in the highly Democratic district , Williams could face a battle in the primary , particularly if the Haitian-American block of voters run a candidate cousin , political operative Samuel Pierre .
