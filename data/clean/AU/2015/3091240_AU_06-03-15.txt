Photo : Andrew Meares <p> Liberal and Labor state Attorneys-General have banded together to warn federal counterpart George Brandis that a " crisis " in legal assistance funding will hurt the most vulnerable members of the community , and that further cuts to legal services are " short-sighted and ill-conceived " . <p> In a blistering letter sent to Senator Brandis on Thursday and signed by the first law officers of all states and territories , the Attorneys-General state that women and children who are victims of domestic violence and Indigenous Australians are among those who will be most affected by cuts to legal funding . <p> " The crisis in legal assistance funding has reached such a level that we , the undersigned Attorneys-General , need to take this step to urge you to reconsider current proposals for the new national funding agreement , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern about proposed cuts in funding to Legal Aid Commissions , Community Legal Centres , the Aboriginal Legal Services as well as a range of changes to administrative arrangements . <p> Advertisement <p> " These proposals will affect the most vulnerable members in our community , including foremost women and children who are victims of or at risk of family violence , as well as Indigenous Australians . It is difficult to reconcile these actions with the Prime Minister 's recent recognition of the importance of tackling domestic and family violence and closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians " . <p> Further cuts could " set us back decades " , the eight law officers , including Brad Hazzard of NSW , Victoria 's Martin Pakula and the ACT 's Simon Corbell have written . <p> Mr Hazzard told Fairfax Media : " A just society demands that people have access to the law . <p> " All we 're asking is for the federal Treasury to realise that they have a role in this . It 's simply undeniable . " <p> Asked if the state and territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Hazzard said , " That 's not for us to do , it 's for the federal attorney general to do " . <p> Mr Hazzard said the High Court case of Dietrich v The Queen clearly set out that courts could halt criminal trials where the accused was unrepresented . <p> This had a flow-on effect to taxpayers because accused people were left " sitting in jails which could be costing an average of $160,000 per year " . <p> Victoria 's Attorney-General Martin Pakula said it would be " totally incongruous " of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to talk about action on family violence while cutting the crucial legal assistance funding . <p> Mr Pakula said Victoria the state already received the lowest per capita share of funding under the current National Partnership Agreement for legal assistance services , which was why Victoria Legal Aid has one of the most stringent means tests in Australia . <p> " If Tony Abbott and George Brandis are serious about tackling family violence , they 'll stop slashing funding for the legal support services that need it most , " Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal parliament had shown " its best side this week with a commitment to tackle the scourge of domestic violence ... but all the fine words in the world amount to nothing if they are not backed up with action " . <p> " Our systems should be built upon one fundamental principle : when forced to court seeking protection from family violence , you and your children should never walk alone , " he said . <p> " I call upon the Prime Minister to urgently reverse these cuts and confirm the continuation of the government 's support for these vital services . " <p> A spokesman for Senator Brandis said he was considering the letter from his state and territory counterparts . <p> " The government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable members of our community and will continue to provide a very substantial amount of funding for legal assistance , " he said . <p> Funding would be considered as part of the 2015 federal budget process , he said . <p> The president of the NSW Bar Association , Jane Needham , SC , acknowledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund for expensive federal criminal cases but said a " a long term solution to the legal aid crisis " was required . <p> " The federal government needs to meet its responsibilities under the Commonwealth/state legal aid agreement and provide the $200 million in funding for legal aid recommended by the Productivity Commission in its recent Access to Justice report , " Ms Needham said .
