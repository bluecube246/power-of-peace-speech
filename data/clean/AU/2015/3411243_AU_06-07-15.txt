2015 in review : tactix continue to be whipping girls of the competition  taking the title from original owners central pulse , for a long and harrowed six years the mainland tactix have been widely known as the whipping girls of the anz championship . they faced some embarrassing scorelines throughout the 2015 season , once again finishing bottom of the table , a feat that is a worrying reoccurrence .  to make matters worse , 2015 was also a record-breaking year , equalling their previous worst records of one win for the season . the win in the last round against the waikato bay of magic was suprising , and may have been the tactix making it to the light at the end of the tunnel .  however , the words ' promise ' and ' potential ' have been thrown around for many seasons . ' rebuilding ' is another one added to the lot , but in the end the tactix 's performances defined the team . an injury-ravaged magic managed to win the new zealand conference , but the tactix  new coach in australian sue hawkins was expected to work miracles , but the 12 signed up to the tactix were missing one key aspect -- height . import demelza fellowes and defender jess moulds both stand at 188cm , but are far shy of the taller goal shooters posting up in the anz championship .  the midcourt was neither flashy , but servicable . hayley saunders was solid in wd and anna thompson sound in c. erikana pederson gained more court time at wa as the season wore on , seeming more available in the attacking end than keshia grant . although the midcourt were a determined bunch , they lacked the ability to generate turnover ball . the oppposing attacking team did n't have the fear of a flying intercept and could move the ball whichever way they pleased . at times it seemed ga bailey mes was the lone ranger in putting the pressure on the ball carrier , creating many deflections in the process .  combination to watch  bailey mes and mwayi kumwenda , both great movers and holders , continued to improve the most turnovers in the tactix side -- either a lack of judgement , or perhaps an unavailable midcourt was the reason for this . mes ' confidence grew over the year -- if her long shots and good accuracy continue into the 2016 season , this could be a dangerous combination for the opposition .  report card  room for improvement .  for a team at the bottom of the table , the optimists will say there is only way to go -- up ! we saw small improvements over the course of this season , and maybe another year with coach sue hawkins will be enough to suprise fans in 2016.  share  comments ( 3 )  height is not always the asset . you have to be a great mover and thinker if you do not have the height . its the strength of the mind that overcomes the disadvantages . let 's not forget our past defenders who did not have the height however had the strength in body and mind to overcome this . its the will and want to win and it -- they just need to believe in it and put it out there when it counts .  height in the defence end does of course help , but it 's not just height that will win you a game . look at corletto of the nsw swifts , geitz of the qld firebirds , cullen of nthn mystics , though somewhat tall , these defenders do not match the height of jfr , cbass , romelda and borrego but their vertical jump , quickness to the ball and athleticism does win them possession over their much taller opponents . tactix are in dire need of quality defenders that 's obvious , but to be honest , they need quality all over the court . both mes and kumwenda do provide that , but 2 players , does not a team make .  recent articles  donate  it 's important that netball scoop is all about the game -- the players , the teams , the fans and the readers . we 're completely ad free , but if you think we 're doing a good job , .
