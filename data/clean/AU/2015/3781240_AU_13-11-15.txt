A quick once over before the final good-bye  John Birmingham  It must feel like one of those dreadful dates at the end of a relationship , when both partners know it 's over , and nobody has really said anything , but everyone has tacitly agreed to start dividing up the old CDs and books . Nobody would be so gauche as to say anything awful to Prince Charles and his second wife , not even Peter Fitzsimons , but it must feel odd , flying all the way around the world to give one 's colony the once over , knowing that soon enough one will be parking the royal yacht here to lower the flag for the last time .  Did Charles and Cammy sip quietly on their Pimms and regret not making the trip earlier , when Tony Abbott would have shown them a much better time than the current republican upstart ? Maybe not . They probably get a bit tired of all the fawning and spittle-licking and Toned Abs , the maximum monarchist , might well have embarrassed them ladythingies . The onion breath , the giant ears flapping with excitement , the repeated tone-deaf invites down to the surf club to get a few laps in -- there 's a reason they only stay for a couple of days at a time , you know .  The highly polished Malcolm Turnbull would never think of discomforting his guests by continually checking his Apple watch and looking surprised whenever he sees they 're still hanging around , but that 's only because it 's tapping him on the wrist , with silent reminders to make sure Lucy sees them to the door .  Hello or goodbye ? Prince Charles and Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall , there 's a reason they only stay for a couple of days at a time , you know . Photo : Getty Images  There was no escaping the terrible awkwardness of it all , though . The dozens of kiddies , press-ganged into waving their little plastic flags , the crackle of static electricity from David Flint 's trouser legs as he unconsciously rubbed them together like a giant cicada , cover up the creaking of an ancient institution barely able to sustain itself . The Royals , when they visit , now recall nothing so much as an ageing musical act which once filled stadiums with roaring crowds and now has to giveaway tickets to get a decent turnout at the Rooty Hill RSL .

Their British counterparts are no less determined to see off the House of Windsor and it 's not impossible to imagine a scenario where Liz and the gang are run out of town and turn up here with their suitcases and a packet of Duchy of Cornwall biscuits looking for a place to bunk down .  " After all , one is your sovereign , you know . "  ---  On the other hand , maybe they 'll drop us first . Having said goodbye to so many Third World dictators and klepto-thugs who decided they 'd make better Heads of State For Life , it ca n't be pleasing for Her Maj to be queen of a mob who 've . You can imagine Liz 2 shaking her head over The Times and frowning as she dunked her toast soldiers in the breakfast googs , muttering , " I thought we were done with all this " .  More than 100 countries lined up to trash talk her Australian colony 's human rights record this week , offering 300 recommendations for how we could do better at looking after refugees , women , Indigenous people , the disabled and the gay community . Even North Korea , a champion abuser of human rights , got to strut the stage , demanding Australia " cease the maltreatment of and violence against the refugees , including sexual violence by the officials in detention centres " . Indonesia , which is toying with the idea of dumping all of its drug dealers on an island guarded only by crocodiles , recommended we " address asylum seeker and refugee issues in accordance with the Bali Process and our human rights and humanitarian obligations " . Even Russia and Iran took time off invading and undermining their neighbours to lodge their official appallment about what the criticism of such egregious hypocrites , but not to dismiss the policies which gave them a free kick in the first place . When the worst people in the world feel free to bitchslap your rep , your rep was probably looking pretty shabby to begin with .  ---  Not as shabby as the taxi cartel , though . Who could have predicted the Victorian Taxi Association 's social media campaign , #YourTaxis , would go so horribly pear-shaped so quickly . ( Hint , everyone , especially the brainiacs behind #CoalisAmazing ) .  The taxi owners ' club seemed to genuinely believe people would flock online to share stories of helpful cabbies who would never take them the long way home .  Instead reality mugged the hashtag . The fabulous fake Taylor Swift account , @SwiftOnSecurity , pronounced #Yourtaxis a " Really interesting social media disaster " , with tales of abusive drivers , filthy cars and criminal behaviour up to and including sexual assault .  Rachael Lonergan ( @RachaelHasIdeas ) shared her fine memories of " The multiple drivers who drove off after My broken foot unconvincing apparently . " Meg Watson ( @msmegwatson ) recalled " having to beg the driver to take the short fare to the hospital because my friend needed stitches in her head " .  As glorious as the hashtag catastrophe was , however , it paled next to the association 's response as the train wreck unfolded . They put out a press release , entitled " YourTaxis #epicfail ? Not quite , " which tried to argue they had totally meant that to happen , when the entire internet rounded on them like a dingo on crystal meth .  " Social media is designed to offer the opportunity to engage directly with the community . YourTaxis has delivered exactly this . "  Yes , yes it did .  83 comments  Yes there was a certain pathos in Charles ' visit . He looked like he was going through the motions . He likes Australia , I am sure , but he is fully aware of the massive indifference . The ageing rock star analogy is so apt , except no-one can remember Date and time  November 13 , 2015 , 10:14PM  They always look like that , even the queen . Quite understandable really , because it must be incredibly boring doing these visits and enduring all the ceremonies and other non-events they have to attend . Great privileges but like living in a fish bowl .  Commenter  Reader  Location  Sydney  Date and time  November 13 , 2015 , 11:15PM  They seem a nice couple . And apparently they were invited to a dinner in Canberra to meet prominent celebrity Australians . Looking forward to learning where they had their cup of tea in Perth and what flavour it was .  Trying to find an angle to make the tour more interesting , one evening news had film of the royal couple in their bathers hanging around a pool on their day off . Or it might just have been mum and dad . Same interest factor .  Commenter  Bernie  Location  HV  Date and time  November 14 , 2015 , 3:00AM  G'day Miguel.JB -- it appears no one else has dared to raise it with you . I might as well get straight to the point ; John , your fawning love for the monarchy is clearly blinding your journalist endeavours . This article -- it 's a homage to the monarchy ; full of hyperbole . Your Duke of Edinburgh undies are showing ! ! As you sip tea from your Princess Diana cup and gaze at your kitchen wall photo montage of Royal Family occasions - I want you take a deep breath , and solemnly promise to be less kind to all the Monarchists when next you put pen to paper .  Commenter  Howe Synnott  Location  Sydney  Date and time  November 14 , 2015 , 7:01AM  @Miguel:Yes its over and even the most fawning forelock tuggers like David Flint must know that times up . With the Labor party now pro republican and the Liberals shedding their aging deeply conservative dinosaurs from the past its clearly time . Turnbull , an avowed republican will probably make his move now that the issue is non-partisan .  Commenter time  November 14 , 2015 , 7:46AM  Probably there are few hits to remember but that said , if Charles and Camilla are such an anachronism and are about to be discarded , why do they attract such crowds wherever they go ?  Commenter  Ian  Location  Fremantle  Date and time  November 14 , 2015 , 9:39AM  Awkwardness ? I gave the Royals a good wave and I received a good wave back . Not sure what the problem is . Lovely people and a future King of Australia .  Commenter  enough is enough  Date and time  November 13 , 2015 , 11:20PM  EIE LOL ... you always nail it ..  Commenter  rustynails  Location  theburbs  Date and time  November 14 , 2015 , 7:02AM  They came , they saw ...... and scuttled off back to the palace and forelock tuggers.At our expense of course.Where is border farce when you really need them to keep the unwanted out .  Commenter  fizzybeer  Date and time  November 14 , 2015 ) saying , the royals are RELICS of the past . TIMEFOR THIS NATION TO GROW UP . EIE was a big Abbott fan who is now just fishand chip paper , yesterday 's new . When the Queen falls of her perch this nation willbecome a republic .
