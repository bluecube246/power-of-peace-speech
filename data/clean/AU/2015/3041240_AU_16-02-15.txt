The Baha'i soul of Australian singer Shameem  It reads like a film script -- struggling musician posts demos online and gets interest from a Grammy-winning producer who offers to co-write her new single -- but it 's what happened to young Perth-based Baha'i singer-songwriter Shameem , writes Geoff Wood .  ' It shows that MySpace is n't completely dead , ' says Shameem , laughing as she recalls the day a Grammy-winning producer turned her life upside down .  ' I got this message on MySpace from James Bryan and I had n't heard of him . He 'd actually found some demos that I 'd done . He said , " I really love your voice and do you write your own music ? "  ' I wrote back and said , " Yes I do . " And he said , " Well would you like to come to the UK sometime and do some co-writing with me ? " '  One of the central teachings of the Baha'i faith is that everybody should investigate the truth for themselves , of things .  Shameem , singer/songwriter  The path from online demos to a British recording studio sounds like fiction but that 's the way it happened for Perth-based singer-songwriter Shameem Taheri-Lee . The result of those recording sessions with James Bryan , who has worked with the likes of Nelly Furtado and Olly Murs , can be found on Shameem 's new album of neo-soul , The Second City .  ' Neo-soul is based on soul music , so it 's got a lot of the feeling of soul music , but it 's got a lot of other influences , ' she says . ' It often has more hip-hoppy beats , and more of an R&amp;B feel to some of it , and sometimes it has quite jazzy chords as well .  ' We 're talking about artists like Jill Scott , Erykah Badu ; Alicia Keys can even be considered a neo-soul artist . '  It turns out that Alicia Keys has been a touchstone for Shameen for a long time .  ' Music has always been around me growing up . my parents both love music a lot .  ' When I was in high school I began writing songs quite seriously and I became enchanted with Alicia Keys because she played the piano and wrote her own songs and she was very soulful . I loved that about her . '  ' When I was 15 I chose to become a Baha'i myself , ' she says . ' One of the central teachings of the Baha'i faith is that everybody should investigate the truth for themselves , independently and come to their own conclusions about the reality of things .  ' The age of maturity is considered to be 15 years old in the Baha'i faith and so at that age I was free to make my own choice and I did choose to continue living as a Baha'i . '  Shameem 's mother , also a Baha'i , was born in Tehran and came to Australia in 1973 , where she met and married her Chinese-Malaysian husband . Baha'is have suffered persecution in Iran for many years , which was one of the reasons the Baha'is in Australia since 1920 , though .  ' Its core belief is that all of humanity is one , that we all come from one God ... and that all the different religions that there are owe their existence to that one God as well , ' says Shameem .  ' He is infinite and incomprehensible to human beings but he makes his will and purpose known to us by sending us a spiritual teacher . We call it a manifestation of God .  Baha'is believe that these manifestations of God include Jesus , Muhammad , Buddha , Krishna and Moses . The 19th century founder of the faith , Bah ? ' u 'll ? h , is considered by Baha'is to be the latest of these manifestations . As Shameem explains , that message continues to have relevance for Bah ? ' ? s today .  ' Some of the teachings that come from the idea of the oneness of humanity include the equality of men and women , the principle of universal education , the elimination of the extremes of poverty and wealth development of an auxiliary universal language so that we can transcend barriers of culture and language . '  For those inclined to listen closely , the songs of Shameem 's album clearly embody core Baha'i teachings . The album title has special significance .  ' The title The Second City comes from a work by Bah ? ' u 'll ? h called The Seven Valleys , ' she says . ' It describes our journey towards God in seven stages . It calls them seven valleys or seven cities .  ' One of the songs on this album is actually inspired by the second valley or city , the Valley of Love , and I just really loved the imagery of the Valley of Love , which is what led me to write a song about it .  ' When I was going to name the album I thought well , it 's my second album and there 's a song inspired by the second of those valleys or cities so I 'll call it The Second City .  The influence of Bah ? ' two tracks which feature a rhyming couplet from the original text chanted in Persian by celebrated Australian Baha'i vocalist Shidan Toloui-Wallace .  Though it 's only her second album , The Second City is a showcase for Shameem 's exceptional voice , mixing soulful grooves with inspiration from the teachings and poetry of the Baha'i faith -- what we might call Baha'i soul .  She 's not alone , either . Shameem is part of a new wave of young Baha'i musicians who have made their mark on the international music scene , ranging from Nashville-based devotional group The Humming Birds ( featuring the daughters of prominent Baha'i duo Seals and Crofts ) with their crafted pop harmonies , to young Australian artists like Shadi Toloui-Wallace , Tahereh Etehad , Natasha Chiang and Mana , who perform Baha'i-inspired Pacific Island music .  For Shameem , the reason for this musical outpouring is obvious .  ' The Baha'i attitude towards music is that music helps to uplift the human soul , that it is food for soul .  ' When you pair beautiful music with words of force for transforming the human heart in a positive way . '  Shameem 's 2015 Australian tour includes Melbourne , Canberra Sydney , Newcastle , Brisbane and Byron Bay , and finishes up in Adelaide on 1st March . The Second City is out now . Take a musical journey through the realm of spirituality , exploring the world 's devotional music . The Rhythm Divine is a soundtrack to the spirit .  Ramsey :  Craven :  09 Apr 2015 4:28:32pm  I met Shameem some years ago and could tell from her eyes that she was a positive spirit inhabiting a troubled world . She is well on the way to becoming whole and i wish her all the best on her journey . Her music 's pretty cool too.Enlightenment . This time it 's impersonal .
