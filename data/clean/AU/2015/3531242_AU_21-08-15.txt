In news that should come as a surprise to no one , Muse have taken issue with the Leicester police force 's decision to covertly scan the faces of 90,000 punters who attended the UK 's Download Festival earlier this year , in a trial of new counter-crime measures .  As NMEreports , frontman Matt Bellamy lashed out at the cops during Muse 's headlining performance of the song Uprising , declaring : " Fuck the Leicestershire police for scanning your faces without you knowing " .  Now , Police 's Chief Constable Simon Cole has addressed Bellamy 's criticisms , arguing that it 's the job of the UK Parliament to decide " what is OK or not " when it comes to matters of privacy and crime prevention .  " For me it 's an area where technology has advanced probably quicker than legislation , " he told BBC Radio Leicester . " The Police and Criminal Evidence Act was written in the 1980s -- this kind of technology existed in science fiction films at that point and now it exists in take account of that . "  But during the same programme , Rachel Robinson of human rights group Liberty urged vigilance : " We really think that there 's a real need for caution here . The police need to think about their relationship with their communities and the broader impact that this kind of mass surveillance can have . "  Muse , meanwhile , released their seventh album Drones back in June , a disc which takes the Orwellian themes of mass surveillance addressed in their 2009 album The Resistance to a whole new apocalyptic level .  The British rock trio are also expected to bring their Drones tour to Australia some time in 2016 .
