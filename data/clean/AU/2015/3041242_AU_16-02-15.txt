two native title claim groups have now voted in favour of a $1.3 billion settlement offer covering parts of western australia 's south west .  the state government made its final offer in july 2013 in an attempt to settle long-running disputes relating to an area north of jurien bay to east of hopetoun , including perth , involving six principal claim groups .  the second of six authorisation meetings was held in busselton at the weekend for members of the south west boojarah native title group .  the south west aboriginal land and sea council 's chief executive glen kelly said 65 per cent of attendees voted to accept the deal .  " there were a couple hundred people there on this occasion , " he said .  it followed a similar result at the first authorisation meeting in bunbury in january , where 70 per cent of approximately 300 members of the gnaala karla boodja claim group voted to accept the offer .  " next weekend we 're in katanning for the wagyl kaip , so the noongar claim , " mr kelly said .  " unfortunately this saturday just gone we had a few people come along who knew that they were n't part of the claim group but wanted to be vocal in the meetings , but they were n't permitted to come in because they 're not part of the claim group .  " that 's actually in line with noongar culture and custom - you ca n't speak for other peoples ' country . "  mr kelly said while the first two meetings had been positive , the council was not taking the outcome of the remaining four meetings for granted .  " we have our work cut out and it is about people expressing their free will so we respect that , " he said .  the agreement includes the creation of a trust which the government would invest $50 million in each year for 12 years , along with land transfers , programs and a noongar recognition bill .  " we 're lining up these claims because there are massive , massive benefits in this agreement that will the final authorisation meeting is scheduled to be held in perth for the whadjuk claim group in late march .
