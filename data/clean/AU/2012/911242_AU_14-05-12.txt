<h> Six lessons from Australia 's richest self-managed super funds <p> Monday , 14 May 2012 14:00 <p> Michael Laurence <p> Share <p> The latest federal budget has focused attention on Australia 's best-paid super fund members -- an estimated 128,000 individuals who earn more than $300,000 a year from their employment , businesses and non-super investments . <p> Under a controversial budget measure -- which could cost as much to administer as the extra tax it will collect -- the salary-sacrificed , compulsory and personally deductible contributions of these high-earning members will be taxed at 30% from July . This is twice the contributions tax being applied to other fund members . <p> The government 's strike against wealthy super fund members raises fascinating questions for all astute fund members ; no matter their income and super balances . Just who are these high-earning fund members ? How do they invest their super money ? Can I learn anything from them ? <p> It is a safe assumption that most of these members earning $300,000-plus would have their own self-managed super fund ( SMSF ) . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are high because most wealthy people would ensure that they , along with their families , take as much advantage as possible of concessionally-taxed super . <p> A few of Australia 's biggest SMSFs have more than $40 million each in assets -- an asset value that will never again be replicated by self-managed funds given the annual caps on super contributions . And there are many SMSFs with balances of $6 million to $20 million . <p> As highlighted in a recent ATO publication , Self-managed superannuation funds -- a statistical overview 2009-10 , rich SMSFs have plenty to teach trustees of SMSFs with vastly smaller assets . In short , SMSFs with huge balances have , on average , much higher performance once costs and taxes are taken into account . <p> However , this out-performance does n't appear to be associated with doing anything extraordinary with investments -- the asset allocation of rich fund portfolios is surprisingly similar to an average-sized fund . The out-performance would largely be attributable to their low costs relative to asset size and their assumed willingness to take quality professional advice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 6,000 funds ) have assets of $5 million to $10 million , while just 0.2% of SMSFs ( less than 1,000 funds ) have more than $10 million in assets . By contrast , SMSFs have average assets of $870,000 . <p> Here are six strategies pursued by the trustees of Australia 's richest six that are worth considering : <h> 1 . Cut costs <p> The ability to shave costs is the great advantage of high-asset SMSFs . Funds with upwards of $10 million had average costs in 2009-10 of only 0.25% of assets . This compares with costs of 0.67% for SMSFs with $500,000 to $1 million , and a breathtakingly high 7% for SMSFs with up to $50,000 in assets . <p> The message for all SMSFs is that costs really matter . And if your fund 's costs seem comparatively high to an average-sized fund , find out why . Keep a close watch on funds management and fund administration fees . And ensure that your fund is not unnecessarily triggering capital gains tax and transaction costs through excessive trading . <p> The reality is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rich SMSFs are able to spread their fixed costs over much more valuable portfolios . <h> 2 . Question performance <p> SMSFs with $10 million-plus returned an average 8.9% in 2009-10 against a return of 6.87% by SMSFs with $500,000 to $1 million , and a negative average return of 8.64% by funds with $50,000 or less . <p> If your SMSF is underperforming , question whether it should be revamped with professional help or whether your money is better served in a big public-offer super fund . The ability of wealthy SMSFs to minimise their costs really lifts their net returns . <h> 3 . Boost family contributions <p> The trustees of rich SMSFs would typically ensure that their family members -- including spouses with no employment income and their children of any age -- contribute as much as possible into the concessionally-taxed super system . <p> Anyone under 65 can contribute to super , even minors who are not in the workforce . And anyone age 65-69 can contribute if doing at least some paid work . <p> However , fund members under 18 are not entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or business income . <p> Despite the $25,000 concessional contributions cap applying to all fund members from July , it is still possible to put large amounts into super . <p> Even from 2012-13 , fund members will be able to contribute $25,000 a year in concessional contributions plus $150,000 in non-concessional contributions . This means that a four-person fund ( the maximum membership for an SMSF ) could receive contributions of up to $700,000 in contributions a year with each member contributing up to their individual caps . <h> 4 . Watch for the dangers of owning only one type of asset <p> SMSF tax and regulatory returns show that rich funds are much less likely than small SMSFs to fall into a potential trap of having most of their assets in a single investment or investment asset class such as shares , cash or property . <p> For instance , 38% of SMSFs with $50,000 or less in assets have all of their money in a single asset class compared with 2% of funds with more than $10 million in assets . And just 5% of funds with $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single asset class . <p> The logic of not putting everything into one asset or type of asset is simple : a fund with a diversified portfolio diversifies its risks and opportunities . <h> 5 . Think twice before putting all of your investments in super <p> As last week 's federal budget illustrates , governments are too willing to turn to super in an attempt to raise extra taxes . <p> Well-informed trustees of SMSFs would understand the case for holding both super and non-super investments to reduce the risk of government interference . <p> Some investors may be surprised at how much can be earned outside super in a tax-effective way . <p> In 2012-13 , an individual investor can earn fully franked dividends of about $100,000 from shares held outside super without having to pay any additional tax -- once franking credits are claimed . ( This assumes the taxpayer has no other taxable income . ) <p> A $2 million share portfolio paying a 5% dividend yield is necessary to produce a $100,000 income . <h> 6 . Consider tax-savings strategies outside super <p> As confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members can make to super from next financial year is $25,000 a year without exceeding their contribution cap . This is likely to encourage more super fund members to pursue tax-savings strategies outside super . <p> These strategies include the negative-gearing of shares and property where appropriate from an investment perspective as well as income-splitting by holding assets in the name of low-earning spouses and in family trusts . Such strategies have long been favoured by trustees of rich SMSFs for their non-super money . <p> But , never forget , gearing multiplies potential losses as well as gains . <h> inside innovation : how 6 SMEs shook up business <h> BROUGHT TO YOU BY <p> Direct Links <p> Topics <p> Our Partners <p> SmartCompany.com.au is Australia 's leading website for SMEs featuring business news , business information and business blogs .
