<h> Good Foreigners Doing Good And Bad Foreigners Doing EVIL <p> It was a touching scene . A young American male sat outside of a McDonalds in Nanjing , sharing a meal with a homeless lady . He had purchased two orders of French fries and poured water into her water bottle . <p> A passerby snapped photos and uploaded them onto a Chinese social working site . Online , people praised the young man -- whose name is Jason Loose -- and gave him the nickname " Brother Fries " . This was n't the only recent act of laowai ( foreign ) kindness : earlier this month , a Brazilian man got beat up as he attempted to stop a robbery . <p> And just as the Chinese internet dubbed both heroes , a 25 year-old British man was caught allegedly molesting multiple women and raping one . An altercation broke out and the 25-year was beaten senseless . Online , forums erupted with some stating how awful foreigners were . <p> In much of Asia , many people 's interaction with foreigners is somewhat limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met foreigners in bars . But simple maths says that the vast majority of the population will not have any sort of meaningful interaction , such as being neighbours , work colleagues or even friends . <p> This is n't due to racism in countries like , say , China , South Korea , or Japan . Like I said , it 's simple math : the number of foreigners is comparatively smaller , so not everyone has the opportunity to pursue a deeper interaction . Thus , much of people 's perception of foreigners is based entirely on things they read online or popular culture they absorb . This is n't unique to Asia . This is , however , also why foreigners ( in Japan , at least ) are often peppered with possibly irksome questions and comments . People have a perception , which informs the things they ask and the things they think . <h> After I grabbed his neck and saw he 's a laowai , I felt more obligated to save the girl . " <p> The recent footage of 25 year-old British man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything awful imaginable . Besides the footage of the inebriated man appearing to rape a woman near Beijing 's Xuanwumen Station ( footage that has been analyzed as if it were Blow-Up ) , social networking sites photos of that same individual . It 's difficult to make out what 's going on in the pictures , but the uploader claimed a bald foreigner was thrusting his erection towards women . The photos were the British man earlier that evening , before the incident that was captured on video . <p> In the video ( viewable here , viewer discrention recommended ) , the woman said she does not know the man . Her underwear was exposed . The man who first appeared in the video was a 24 year-old security guard from a nearby building . " After I grabbed his neck and saw he 's a laowai , I felt more obligated to save the girl , " he told the Global Times . Does that mean he 'd be less obligated if the accused rapist was Chinese ? <h> " Pictures showing a foreigner helping a Chinese might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The beatdown the British man was filmed and uploaded online with the title : " Laowai , We 're Going To Kick Your arse Out of China " . The man , who speaks no Chinese and who is on a tourist visa , is currently in police custody . Chinese legal experts think he 'll serve about two weeks in detention and then be deported . <p> The whole incident clashed with the foreigners-sure-are-nice attitude that the media played up , and it 'll serve to reinforce any unsavory stereotypes people in China have . Many people , no doubt , are able to make the distinction between the individual and the group , but not everyone . <p> What 's more , making divisions , such as foreign or native , can not be helped . This is a foreign man in China . That is no mistake . However , these same distinctions cause people to lose sight of the individual . Instead of thinking that a foreign sharing his food with a homeless lady means all foreigners are nice , it 's more accurate to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same holds true for the British man . What 's lost in this is the big sweeping brushstrokes that the word " foreigner " leaves out . Even if it 's being used in a neutral context , it separates " us " and " them " . This is underscored in Loose 's reaction to his generosity . <p> " I shall never gain such wide attention in the U.S. by doing so , " Loose wrote online about his French fry sharing . " One reason could be I am not a ' laowai ' ( foreigner ) at home . Another is this kind of thing is quite common in America . " <p> But this goes even further . Li Yonggang , a professor who teaches Internet phenomenon at Nanjing University , told the Global Times , " Pictures showing a foreigner helping a Chinese might help raise public awareness about doing good deeds . " By that logic , video of a foreigner doing awful things might help public awareness about doing evil deeds . But the sticking point is whether these individuals are behaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good or bad -- or because they are in another country and behaving in a manner that they never would at home -- whether that 's doing good deals or truly deplorable ones . <p> Culture Smash is a daily dose of things topical , interesting and sometimes even awesome -- game related and beyond . <h> Tags <h> Discuss <p> reminder sort of famous pokemon website admin water pokemon master got uh warned by jap police after he posted images from what he described as 1 of thee WORST MOVIES EVER , only for first unofficial pic of patrat , which was seen by a jap who was a member for 2chan , for which it was a bit uneasy , during which he posted a rant , rest is history <p> I think part of the reason groups get such broad praise/blame for things like these is just because the news offers very little information about those involved . <p> Even in this article , all we get is age , gender , and nationality . There 's nothing to distinguish a " 25-year-old British man " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's not really a way around it other than telling the person 's life story basically , to differentiate them from others in general . I suppose they could just make it more colourful : " asshole involved in sexual assault " . At least then people could unite with " all assholes are criminals , we need to get rid of all the assholes ! " <p> Ah , that would be Journalism 101 - perpetrators of sexual crimes are not named/described in any way that could lead to their being identified , as it is necessary to protect their victim . Anybody who releases identifying info , and thus jeopardises the victim 's anonymity , is breaking the law . I imagine it is the same in most countries . <p> My thoughts exactly .... why people find time to complain that a story holds no interest to them is beyond me . I you are n't interested , move on and do n't read it , do n't wast your time complaining that it is n't about video games .... the world is full of things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of no interest to anyone .
