9 comments so far  W.A has a culture of bad driving , Thanks to Parents and Driving Schools , Driving School Vehicles all go around with signage advertising L to P etc .... do any of them advertise that they actually teach you to Drive ? They seem more concerned with people passing their driving test than they are at making sure people can actually drive.Why do we have a ' P ' Plate system ? If someone is capable of driving then they shoud n't need ' P ' Plates , Should they ? Is it because everyone knows the system is wrong ? Parents need to be more vigilant , watch how they drive as the kids watch them , teach them to respect other road users , to share the road , nothing is worth losing your life on the road , and who wants that knock on the door , telling them that their child is dead ..... ? The government have a roll to play here as well , why do they hand out extraordinary licences ? if someone disobeys the then let them BUY it back , just because they pay an application fee etc ... SO WRONG !  Commenter  Wrong Culture  Date and time  October 23 , 2012 , 8:16PM  Another pseudo academic trotting out the same old same old and refusing to address the real issues of road safety . First and foremost - poor road engineering ; secondly - poorly integrated traffic lights that cause unnecessarilly long waits at lights ; thirdly - the fixation on the revenue raising option of lowering speed limits in total disregard of road design . Now go away and leave us alone . Ex coppers should rarely be seen and seldom heard ! ! ! !  Commenter  Beamer  Location  East Perth  Date and time  October 23 , 2012 , 9:49PM  Who is this genius . No body ever died because of poor merging skills , sure it can be untidy . Speed , drinkdriving , using mobile phones - these activities are out of control . These are the things that matter and result in serious accidents and death . and time  October 23 , 2012 , 10:05PM  if merging skills are to be improved on the freeway , it might actually be beneficial to increase the limit particularly on the Mitchell/Narrows interchange - too much braking to 80 to keep to an artificially imposed speed limit .  Also a source of frustration on the fwy is that drivers do n't observe keep to the left/middle lane preferring to stay in the RH lane at 95km/hr or less - if you can not do a 100 stay to the left . ( it 's now easier to stay at the speed limit in the LH or centre lanes - go figure .  Myriad of other issues but I am not sure anyone is listening .  Commenter  John P  Location  menora  Date and time  October 24 , 2012 , 6:45AM  The last thing we need to be doing is telling Perth drivers to go slower . Four simple words **34;253;TOOLONG .  Commenter  seq  Date and time  October 24 , 2012 , 7:31AM  " Running a red get away with it " . Impossible - popular opinion has it that Lycra clad cyclists are the only ones running reds in Oz .  Commenter  Rego - the panacea for everything  Location  Perth  Date and time  October 24 , 2012 , 7:42AM  One word- INATTENTION would be the cause of a majority of incidents on the roads not speeding , drink driving , merging or traffic lights ( all are bad though ) . Not concentrating fully on the most dangerous task most of us do regularly would have to be a major driver ( sic ) for rad vehicle incidents , couple this with poor driving skills and a do n't care attitude ( ie drink driving , reckless driving ) is a killer  Commenter  Keylargo  Location  perth  Date and time  October 24 , 2012 , 8:02AM  What about the cars ? Why do nt we have yearly safety checks ? Can someone please explain why we spend all this money on ' road safety ' but the ACTUAL cars are not safety tested . someone has put this togthor ?  Commenter  M Lopez  Location  The Mean Streets  Date and time  October 24 , 2012 , 8:17AM  Safety concerns for our learners on the roads should be considered . Especially making them more visible . I am sick of impatient tailgaters who drive almost up our rear and then curse us for being slow while out on the road with my daughter . She is learning for Gods Sake , give her a break ! If people could determine they are learners a lot easier , perhaps they would avoid confronting them so much and leave them be . There should be a better system or more visible sign to identify these learners so they are given the berth they need to gain confidence on our roads .
