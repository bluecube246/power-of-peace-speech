<h> Toyota Prius camper conversion unveiled at Tokyo Auto Salon <p> Ever wanted to go camping but always thought campervans consumed too much fuel ? A camper conversion for the Toyota Prius could be your answer . <p> Looking a little like a giant telephone handle stuck onto the top of a Prius -- or even a Smurf if you owned a blue Prius -- the camper conversion was unveiled at the 2012 Tokyo Auto Salon in Japan over the weekend . <p> It 's a custom ( obviously ) creation developed by a camping specialist called Campinn . The company starts out by cutting rear sections of the Prius out and adapting a special fibre-reinforced plastic mould over the top . <p> The large mould conceals a door entrance at the rear , with its own roller blind , and two beds -- one of which sits on top of the roof , and another that takes place of where the rear seats and boot space used to be . <p> Campinn says there 's also an optional flip-out coffee table and sofa that can be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior comes with Prius taillights which have been grafted into the custom mould . <p> The large camper section adds 520mm to the Prius ' overall length ( 4460mm in standard form ) , and 560mm to the overall height ( 1490mm in standard form ) . <p> We 're not sure how much weight this conversion adds to the back of the rather sorry-looking Prius , but it would likely put additional loads onto the Prius 's hybrid powertrain . <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> ugly as it can be ... home this conversion flies away at the speed of 30km/h <p> Johnny <p> Well that 's rather different . <p> Labryz <p> What . The . Hell . That thing is messed up.Although the comment about it looking like a smurf is vastly amusing and would be tempted to buy just for that reason . <p> 3D4 <p> I wonder how this house on the top of ( otherwise perfectly aerodynamic car ) affects the fuel consumption , performance and the drive generaly .. Must be " fun " .. <p> Sam <p> Looks like a mobile porta loo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener , better <p> Chucky <p> Well , if I am retired and just want to travel around australia on a sealed and flat unsealed road . I do n't mind this . Just wonder if they have any option on larger fuel tank . <p> Tony <p> lol .... why ! ? <p> garl <p> i 'll have the camper part in black so i can call it elvis <p> Al <p> This looks hideous ! Although I can understand the appeal of a hybrid car for camping as you can leave the A/C or fan on all night running on battery with the engine turning on occasionally to keep the battery charged . You can also power small appliances/electrical items from the battery for reasonable time . But somehow I doubt this offers much more room than a Prius V wagon with its rear seats folded ... <p> Force-15 <p> It 's eating the Prius ! <p> lol <p> ahahhahahahahahha <p> Luke Brinsmead <p> Paint the car blue and it could be a smurf . <p> Dave S <p> It 's not a tumour ! ! <p> Marky Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Looks like something the boys on topgear would slap together . <p> DeskDreaming <p> Slap a ' Sandman ' sticker on the back and you get a cult classic <p> Steve42 <p> I like how the title of the article has Tokyo misspelt as " Toyko " ... stangely appropriate ... must be a freudian slip by the author <p> Sumpguard <p> I 'd still rather sleep under the stars and associated heavy hailstorms . I 'd rather be seen dead from a lightning strike than be seen dead in that ! <p> Kj <p> Holy Fukushima that 's ugly ! Ladies and gentleman we have a new winner in the ugliest and silliest cars ever built competitions -- and it is about as aerodynamic as a block of flats ! I 'd rather a holiday in Afghanistan than go away in that thing !
