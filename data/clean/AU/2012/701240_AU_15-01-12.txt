toyota prius camper conversion unveiled at tokyo auto salon  ever wanted to go camping but always thought campervans consumed too much fuel ? a camper conversion for the toyota prius could be your answer .  looking a little like a giant telephone handle stuck onto the top of a prius -- or even a smurf if you owned a blue prius -- the camper conversion was unveiled at the 2012 tokyo auto salon in japan over the weekend .  it 's a custom ( obviously ) creation developed by a camping specialist called campinn . the company starts out by cutting rear sections of the prius out and adapting a special fibre-reinforced plastic mould over the top .  the large mould conceals a door entrance at the rear , with its own roller blind , and two beds -- one of which sits on top of the roof , and another that takes place of where the rear seats and boot space used to be .  campinn says there 's also an optional flip-out coffee table and sofa that can be added exterior comes with prius taillights which have been grafted into the custom mould .  the large camper section adds 520mm to the prius ' overall length ( 4460mm in standard form ) , and 560mm to the overall height ( 1490mm in standard form ) .  we 're not sure how much weight this conversion adds to the back of the rather sorry-looking prius , but it would likely put additional loads onto the prius 's hybrid powertrain .  social share  ugly as it can be ... home this conversion flies away at the speed of 30km/h  johnny  well that 's rather different .  labryz  what . the . hell . that thing is messed up.although the comment about it looking like a smurf is vastly amusing and would be tempted to buy just for that reason .  3d4  i wonder how this house on the top of ( otherwise perfectly aerodynamic car ) affects the fuel consumption , performance and the drive generaly .. must be " fun " ..  sam  looks like a mobile porta loo . greener , better  chucky  well , if i am retired and just want to travel around australia on a sealed and flat unsealed road . i do n't mind this . just wonder if they have any option on larger fuel tank .  tony  lol .... why ! ?  garl  i 'll have the camper part in black so i can call it elvis  al  this looks hideous ! although i can understand the appeal of a hybrid car for camping as you can leave the a/c or fan on all night running on battery with the engine turning on occasionally to keep the battery charged . you can also power small appliances/electrical items from the battery for reasonable time . but somehow i doubt this offers much more room than a prius v wagon with its rear seats folded ...  force-15  it 's eating the prius !  lol  ahahhahahahahahha  luke brinsmead  paint the car blue and it could be a smurf .  dave s  it 's not a tumour ! !  marky mark  looks like something the boys on topgear would slap together .  deskdreaming  slap a ' sandman ' sticker on the back and you get a cult classic  steve42  i like how the title of the article has tokyo misspelt as " toyko " ... stangely appropriate ... must be a freudian slip by the author  sumpguard  i 'd still rather sleep under the stars and associated heavy hailstorms . i 'd rather be seen dead from a lightning strike than be seen dead in that !  kj  holy fukushima that 's ugly ! ladies and gentleman we have a new winner in the ugliest and silliest cars ever built competitions -- and it is about as aerodynamic as a block of flats ! i 'd rather a holiday in afghanistan than go away in that thing !
