independence important - but support critical  with one-stop-shop and non-aligned dealer group yellow brick road ( ybr ) recently announcing plans to recruit wealth professionals disenchanted with the institutional environment , the value and definition of independence is again in the spotlight .  in a statement , ybr said it was looking to hire professionals to work flexible hours , who want a " refreshing alternative to the institutional jobs offered by the major banks " and who want to " provide agnostic , independent financial advice to australian consumers " - with independent in this case meaning " non-bank " rather than the regulator 's designation pertaining to remuneration models .  ybr chief executive matt lawler said the group is receiving a lot of enquiries from current bank employees involved in a restructure or in situations where their remuneration has changed , or they have been pigeonholed into selling products rather than giving advice .  consumers are also drawn to strong brands but do n't necessarily have the same level of trust in big banks as with other brands , he added people who want to control their own destiny , where their hard work and effort is rewarded . many financial professionals today have a great amount of experience but are questioning the traditional model of sitting at a desk from eight to five every day . "  managing director of securitor and licensee select at bt , matt englund , says the current mood within the group is " fantastic " as advisers emerge from a period of uncertainty .  this is backed by recent wealth insights research that shows adviser sentiment has improved significantly over the past six months .  " our planners are so enthusiastic that they 're supported by and are partnered with a large institution - they love it . they see this period of change navigating future of financial advice regulations as a great opportunity to partner with somebody with the resources to support them through the things that are going on , " he said .  " independently minded business owners need to have the freedom to run their own businesses but they need to have the support from somebody with done . "  for planners running a small business under the securitor licence , " ultimately it 's their asset , it 's their client base and their business , " englund said .  " we do have very specific rules about quality of advice and we do have constructs around apls ( approved product lists ) but our apl is quite broad - it 's not about product , it 's about the quality of advice and practice development and support to help run a profitable , saleable business , " he said .  the director of self-licensed practice waterfall way associates , dacian moses , agreed the idea of having the support of a large licensee in navigating regulatory change was appealing , but also said clients considered independent advice important .  this is also evidenced by the institutions employing multiple brand strategies in an attempt to capture that market , he added .  " you ca n't have it both ways - you ca n't say that brand is ' standing behind you ' , then try and represent that you 're independent happy with the regulator 's definition of " independence " , even though the requirement to be purely fee for service and receive no volume bonuses meant many boutiques did not qualify .
