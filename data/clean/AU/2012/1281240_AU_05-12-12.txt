An online study into teen drinking in the Hunter region has revealed that peer pressure to drink does not just affect young people , but is also having an impact on their parents .  Doctor Conor Gilligan from the University of Newcastle 's School of Medicine and Public Health is behind the study , which is surveying parents of 13 to 17-year-olds about their attitudes towards teen drinking .  Doctor Gilligan says initial results show local parents do not want their children to become socially isolated and are often influenced by what they perceive other parents are doing .  " Over 50 per cent of parents might provide their kids with small amounts of alcohol for supervised drinking , as a sip or a taste , " she said .  " But they perceive that a larger proportion are actually providing alcohol for drinking in other circumstances , so they 've got this misperception about what 's actually going on , so that can perpetuate the problem . "  She says many parents appear to have a skewed perception of how much  " Chinese whispers starts to happen as well , because this is something that every parent that I speak to wants the advice , wants to know what to do , " she said .  " Especially at this time of year , the questions are being asked , the formal is coming up or the end of year celebrations are coming up - can I drink ?  " And it 's a dilemma for parents . "  A Facebook group has been established to help families , the Hunter Parents Alcohol Forum , which also has links to the survey .
