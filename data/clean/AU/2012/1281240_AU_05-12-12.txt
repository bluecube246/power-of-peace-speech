an online study into teen drinking in the hunter region has revealed that peer pressure to drink does not just affect young people , but is also having an impact on their parents .  doctor conor gilligan from the university of newcastle 's school of medicine and public health is behind the study , which is surveying parents of 13 to 17-year-olds about their attitudes towards teen drinking .  doctor gilligan says initial results show local parents do not want their children to become socially isolated and are often influenced by what they perceive other parents are doing .  " over 50 per cent of parents might provide their kids with small amounts of alcohol for supervised drinking , as a sip or a taste , " she said .  " but they perceive that a larger proportion are actually providing alcohol for drinking in other circumstances , so they 've got this misperception about what 's actually going on , so that can perpetuate the problem . "  she says many parents appear to have a skewed perception of how much  " chinese whispers starts to happen as well , because this is something that every parent that i speak to wants the advice , wants to know what to do , " she said .  " especially at this time of year , the questions are being asked , the formal is coming up or the end of year celebrations are coming up - can i drink ?  " and it 's a dilemma for parents . "  a facebook group has been established to help families , the hunter parents alcohol forum , which also has links to the survey .
