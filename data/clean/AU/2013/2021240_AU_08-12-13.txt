<p> Western Australia 's timber industry is preparing to tighten its belt after the release of a new framework to manage the state 's south-west forests . <p> Forest resource is allocated on a ten-year plan which comes to the end of its cycle at the end of this month . <p> Timber sourced from 2.5 million hectares of forests from Lancelin to Denmark is supplied under contract by the state government through the Forest Products Commission . <p> The forest industry says the latest ten year plan is the most cautious plan it has seen . <p> Executive director of Forest Industries Federation WA , Melissa Haslan , says the added environmental parameters in the new plan will put pressure on industry by increasing the cost of harvest . <p> " The problem is it has swung to far one way which puts enormous pressure on industry , " she said .. <p> " We have no problem on environmental assessment , but where it is in excess and to the death of the industry we say ' hold on guys maybe that 's gone a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Conservation Council of WA , Piers Verstegen , says forestry areas have been managed in an unsustainable way . <p> " They have been overcut , for many , many years , and now the industry has been forced into less and less viable areas , " he said . <p> " Because of their previous over-cutting they do n't have the same resource to access . " <p> The forest industry says the claims made by conservationists that forestry is running at a loss is ludicrous . <p> " Industry generates $1.6 billion annually for our economy and it employs thousands of people directly and indirectly , particularly in the southwest . " Melissa Haslam said . <p> " It is an important sector that is not subsidised by the government in anyway . " <p> Key features of the Forest Management Plan 2014-23 include : - Continued protection of all old-growth forest , totalling more than 334,000ha- Enhanced protection for large marri trees , which provide nesting and food for black cockatoos- An increase in protected areas by adding 4,000ha to Whicher National Park near Busselton- Increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting on the health and diversity of the forest- A new objective to protect and conserve the value of the land to Noongar culture and heritage .
