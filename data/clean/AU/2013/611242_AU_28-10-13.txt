Elementos Limited ( ASX:ELT ) Cleveland Project Tungsten Potential  Brisbane , Oct 29 , 2013 AEST ( ABN Newswire ) - Elementos Limited ( ASX:ELT ) ( OTCMKTS:ELTLF ) ( " Elementos " or the " Company " ) is pleased to announce a Conceptual Exploration Target and work program for Foley 's tungsten zone at Cleveland .  Independent consultants , Mining One , have reported an Exploration Target for Foley 's zone of between 72,000 and 120,000 tonnes of contained WO3 , below 850m RL . The Exploration Target , defined from 26 diamond drill holes totaling 6,796 metres , is tabulated below . The potential quantity and grade of the exploration target is conceptual in nature . There has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource .  The Exploration Target is in addition to the previously reported Inferred Mineral Resource for Foley 's zone above 850m RL which is more intensively drilled . The Inferred Mineral Resource above 850m RL , estimated independently by Mining 3.89Mt @ 0.30% WO3 for total contained metal of 13,000 tonnes WO3 .  Foley 's tungsten zone represents an exciting new opportunity for the Company , and the potential of the tungsten deposit has not previously been recognised . Tungsten is a high-value metal , with supplies of tungsten outside of China , which controls approximately 84% of the market , difficult to secure . The Company will now commence a work program to study the development potential of the project .  Cleveland Tungsten Project  At the Cleveland project , the Foley 's tungsten deposit is located approximately 350 metres below the mine portal and largely separate from the lodes that constitute the Cleveland tin-copper resource , the primary short-term development focus of the Company .  The Foley 's tungsten mineralisation occurs principally as wolframite ( ( Fe , Mn ) WO3 ) , hosted in both the stock-work around , and within a greisenised porphyry dyke .  The Company 's future development scenario for the Foley 's tungsten deposit envisages an underground caving style operation , and recovery of saleable concentrates through standard gravity , Tasmanian minerals province is well supported by developed infrastructure and a strong mining culture . Cleveland is linked to Burnie export port by sealed roads . Accessible power runs through the Cleveland exploration licence area , and there is abundant processing water available . The Burnie region has a large , available , and industrial and mine savvy workforce .  Exploration Target  Mining One have independently reviewed historical data relating to the Foley 's tungsten deposit , and defined a geological model and Exploration Target outlining its potential . The Exploration Target , which is separate to the JORC Inferred Mineral Resource , has been defined from 26 diamond drill holes into Foley 's zone totaling 6,796 metres , sampled and assayed over 2.5 metre intervals Drill-hole intercepts in mineralisation totaled 3,638 metres at a length-weighted average grade of 0.20% WO3 .  The tungsten bearing stock-work is currently considered to dip vertically and has a known strike length of about 300 metres , an across strike width of up to 300 metres and a down dip extent of 900 metres .  Elementos is an Australian , ASX-listed stage tin-copper and tungsten project in Tasmania , together with a number of prospective copper and gold assets in South America and Australia .
