<p> GBM Resources has defined a 2.5 kilometre long semi-continuous copper-in-soil anomaly at its Mt Morgan gold-copper project in Queensland . <p> GBM Resources ' ( ASX : GBZ ) recent field work has defined a 2.5 kilometre long semi-continuous copper-in-soil anomaly at its Mt Morgan gold-copper project in Queensland . <p> Notably , the zone of porphyry-style hydrothermal alteration with associated copper mineralisation at the Oakey Creek prospect remains open to the north . <p> Extensive scattered copper oxide along with native copper was observed in outcrop . <p> The company has also defined a north-west trending regional structure by a K:Th airborne radiometric anomaly . <p> Details <p> The company ranked the prospect area for attention on the strength of a linear K:Th airborne radiometric anomaly parallel to the regional structural trend along with the presence of historic copper oxide workings . <p> The alteration zone is at least 3.2 kilometres by 1 kilometre in size , and is parallel to and partly overlapping the radiometric anomaly . <p> The linear nature of the alteration zone and its orientation suggests fault control to the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered throughout the alteration zone and may have a genetic relationship to the alteration and mineralisation . <p> Localised zones of intense copper-bearing hydrothermal breccia were also observed within the main alteration envelope . <p> Copper oxide and occasional native copper is primarily hosted at the boundaries of the angular fine grain green clasts within the breccia . <p> The copper-in-soil anomaly generally correlates well with the broad alteration zone and the breccia . <p> Rock-chip sampling within the alteration and breccia units produced a number of assays returning greater than 0.3% copper with peak results of 6.74% copper , 39.8ppm silver and 52ppb gold . <p> Anomalous gold in soil is also present within the soil survey area with a peak assay of 0.2ppm gold with 31 samples returning greater than 100ppb gold . <p> However , the pattern of gold in soil does not correlate particularly well with copper and the low level gold response in the rock-chip samples indicating that more work is required to understand the gold anomalism at Oakey Creek . <p> The forward program at Oakey Creek Prospect will see extensions to the current soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north along with continued detailed mapping and rock-chip sampling . Ground Induced Potential ( IP ) geophysical surveys will then be considered to help define targets within the large alteration zone for drill testing . <p> The Mt Morgan Project <p> The Mount Morgan Project is located 40 kilometres southwest of Rockhampton , Queensland , close to the world class Mt Morgan Copper-Gold mine which produced in excess of 8.0M ounces of gold ( Au ) and 400,000 tonnes of copper ( Cu ) metal . <p> Historic exploration in the Mount Morgan area has primarily focused on the discovery of a Mount Morgan analogue which has , up until recently , been interpreted by many as a VHMS ( massive sulphide ) type . <p> Until recent GBM work , no activity targeting intrusion related systems had been completed nor had there been thorough examination and interpretation of geophysical datasets or detailed compilation of existing exploration data . <p> Proactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news , articles and research reports on ASX " Small and Mid-cap " stocks with distribution in Australia , UK , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @
