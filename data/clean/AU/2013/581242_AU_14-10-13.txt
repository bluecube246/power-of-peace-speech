<h> Jellyfish born in space are n't happy on Earth <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Rebecca Helm does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Why send jellyfish to space ? Well , because it 's awesome which is true of anything involving space . But mostly because of little crystals that they keep in their bodies , and what these crystals can tell us about long-term human space travel . <p> When a jellyfish grows , it forms calcium sulfate crystals at the margin of its body ( termed a bell ) . These crystals are surrounded by a little cell pocket , coated in specialised hairs , which are equally spaced around the bell . When jellyfish turn , the crystals roll down with gravity to the bottom of the pocket , moving the cell hairs , which in turn send signals to nerve cells . In this way , jellyfish are able to sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to happen is gravity . <p> Humans have gravity sensing structures too , and therein lies the crux : in space with no gravity , will these structures grow normally ? If humans ever want to colonise places in deep space , then we may need to have kids in zero gravity . Will these kids develop normal gravity sensing , even after growing up without it ? <p> For jellyfish , at least , things are n't so good . After developing in space , these astronaut jellyfish have a hard life back on Earth . While development of the sensory pockets appears normal , many more jellies had trouble getting around once on the planet , including pulsing and movement abnormalities , compared to their Earth-bound counterparts . <p> Weightlessness , it 's my thing.hfiguiere <p> Human gravity sensing is n't exactly like that of jellyfish , but it 's close . The human inner ear contains both fluids and small crystals , which tell us not only the angle of our head , but also our forward momentum . Even with these differences , there is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , if jellyfish babies have trouble gravity sensing on Earth after being in space , human babies may be in trouble too . <p> Human births in space could mean a lifetime of Earthly confusion . Long term space travel will be fraught with developmental challenges to the babies growing onboard . If the jellyfish say growing up in space is n't so great , we better be listening .
