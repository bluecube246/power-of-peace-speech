a hacker by the name of " jason " ( thanks games.on.net ) was able to briefly gain access to twitter account for riot games ' ceo marc merill , taking to the account to threaten the release of a finished but not yet released league of legends card game .  it is unclear whether the threat was actually real or not , jason claimed that " riot does n't want you to play this game , " stating that its a " stand-alone game . i have the server and client source . "  a login screen for the unreleased game was also released , showing the title ' league of legends : supremacy ' , which apparently matches up with a previous domain registration last year by riot games . an imgur gallery was also uploaded with various game icons however has since been pulled from the website .  merill has since claimed control of his twitter account , stating that the images were " old screens from one of the many prototypes we 've experimented with " .
