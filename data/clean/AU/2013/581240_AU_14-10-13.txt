<p> A hacker by the name of " Jason " ( thanks games.on.net ) was able to briefly gain access to Twitter account for Riot Games ' CEO Marc Merill , taking to the account to threaten the release of a finished but not yet released League of Legends card game . <p> It is unclear whether the threat was actually real or not , Jason claimed that " Riot does n't want you to play this game , " stating that its a " stand-alone game . I have the server and client source . " <p> A login screen for the unreleased game was also released , showing the title ' League of Legends : Supremacy ' , which apparently matches up with a previous domain registration last year by Riot Games . An Imgur gallery was also uploaded with various game icons however has since been pulled from the website . <p> Merill has since claimed control of his Twitter account , stating that the images were " old screens from one of the many prototypes we 've experimented with " .
