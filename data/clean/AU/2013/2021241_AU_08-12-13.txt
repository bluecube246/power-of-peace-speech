<h> How President Obama Helped A VC Land The First-Ever Investment In Snapchat <p> LightspeedJeremy Liew is a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners who found hot startups like Snapchat and Whisper before everyone else . <p> It 's a good thing Jeremy Liew met Barack Obama . <p> In March 2012 , Liew 's Facebook profile picture was of himself and the President . He did n't know it at the time , but that picture would help him land a crucial early stage investment . <p> Liew is a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners , a firm with $US2 billion under management . There are nine partners who lead startup deals in the United States . Only Liew and one other partner , Justin Caldbeck , hunt for startups in the crowded consumer technology space . And in March 2012 , Liew had his eye on an app called Snapchat . <p> When Liew first found Snapchat , the disappearing photo app had fewer than 100,000 installs . Liew 's partner had seen it on his teenage daughter 's phone . She told her father there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birds , Instagram , and Snapchat . Liew was familiar with the first two . But he had never heard of Snapchat . <p> The comment was enough to pique Liew 's curiosity . He made it his mission to find out who was behind the mysterious app . <p> Liew did a Google search and came up dry . No articles had been written about Snapchat . There was no contact information on the startup 's website except for a generic email address . Liew messaged it and heard nothing back . Liew looked up the company on LinkedIn and sent a message . Again , there was no response . <p> Determined , Liew did a WhoIs lookup on the domain name , Snapchat.com . It had been registered by Toyopa Group , the former parent company of Snapchat . Spiegel had named it after the street his father lived on , Toyopa Drive . <p> Liew did a Google search for Toyopa Group and found Evan Spiegel 's name . He was a student at Stanford , where Liew had also gone to school . Liew was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When Liew sent the Facebook message , Spiegel finally replied . He was n't looking to raise a round of financing ; Liew was fine with that . Liew invited Spiegel to meet him at his office on the most famous street in the entrepreneurial world , Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park . A few feet to the left sits Greylock Partners , Sequoia Capital and Institutional Venture Partners . To the right sits Khosla Ventures . <p> During the meeting , Spiegel shared his vision for Snapchat . Facebook is a place where you can share superficial feelings with the world . It 's for sharing times when you 're happy , confident , and enjoying life . But what about all the other times when you 're sad , feeling crazy or even depressed ? <p> Spiegel felt there should be a place where intimate feelings could be expressed privately via fleeting messages . After all , true friendships are formed when people share both positive and negative experiences . And negative experiences ca n't be housed on a public , identifying platform like Facebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but engagement metrics were strong . " People were using it like crazy and staying for a really long time , " Liew recalls . <p> Eventually , Spiegel let Lightspeed invest in his company . It was the only investor in a $US485,000 seed round , which Spiegel raised in May 2012 . He was still three classes shy of graduating . Snapchat has since raised more than $US120 million and it turned down a multi-billion-dollar acquisition offer from Facebook . <p> Liew later asked Spiegel why he returned the Facebook request and none of his other messages . <p> " It was because you had President Obama in your profile picture , " Spiegel said . <p> " There 's serendipity involved in all this stuff , " Liew said , recalling that conversation . <p> But Liew 's investments are based on much more skill than luck . His name is frequently mentioned in the Los Angeles startup scene , where a number of his early investments are panning out . <p> Whisper is another social app Liew found before other investors . Based in Santa Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supportive environment , like an open-source diary . Liew saw Whisper trending in the App Store and it fit his firm 's investment thesis . <p> Liew emailed its founder , 26-year-old Michael Heyward , on a Monday . He said he 'd be in town for a board meeting that Tuesday . By Wednesday , Liew convinced Heyward to meet with his partner . On Friday , Liew sent Heyward -- who had n't been interested in raising a round of financing -- a term sheet . On Saturday , Liew flew back to Santa Monica and finalise the investment in Whisper . Lightspeed led its $US3 million Series A round of financing . <p> Whisper now has millions of registered users . It has 80-times more content than there are Wikipedia pages . It has raised $US25 million . <p> Liew also found ShoeDazzle , a once-buzzy startup run by Kim Kardashian and Brian Lee , early . Like Spiegel , Lee was n't interested in meeting him . Lee told Liew that ShoeDazzle was profitable , so it did n't need venture capital . <p> Liew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently invested in a consumer startup that ignored his initial emails . Instead of taking " no " for an answer , Caldbeck showed up on the startup 's doorstep with a plate full of cupcakes . <p> In addition to being persistent , Caldbeck and Liew are observant . If his partner had n't been an engaged father , Liew might have missed Snapchat . With ShoeDazzle , Liew noticed a friend collecting pink boxes of shoes . He asked her what all the boxes were about ; she told him they were Kim Kardashian 's shoe-of-the-month club . <p> Liew and Caldbeck try to think differently about their investments . So while other VCs are looking right , they turn their heads a little to the left . <p> " When everyone is saying , ' We do n't invest in this , ' that 's sometimes a good time to invest , " says Liew . " You have to find a reason the conventional wisdom no longer applies . " <p> Liew used the recent craze around e-commerce startups and the rise of Facebook 's platform as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Liew says . " They do n't have brand-names and they do n't have scale , so their cost to acquire customers should be much higher and their lifetime value much lower than incumbents . The only time it makes sense to invest in e-commerce startups is when there 's a new customer acquisition channel that 's scalable . Startups are nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunity and grow to scale before the incumbents even notice . The first time that happened since Google paid search was when Facebook opened up its right rail to e-commerce companies and advertisers . " <p> Startups like Gilt Groupe , LivingSocial , ShoeDazzle , Groupon , and Ruelala were able to scale their customer bases quickly and cheaply on the coattails of Facebook before larger brands caught on . Now that the Facebook channel is saturated with brands like Nordstrom and JC Penney , e-commerce startups ca n't rely on it for growth . <p> Snapchat and Whisper seem like obvious investments now . But when Lightspeed invested , most people assumed social startups had peaked . Facebook won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing off social startups altogether , Liew 's team tried to find entrepreneurs who were innovating in places where Facebook could n't follow . <p> Facebook , Liew determined , is the journal of record for our real lives . By its nature , it needs to tie users to their real identities . It also aspires to host everything its users publish forever . That creates an opportunity for startups to host temporary content or to thrive on anonymity . <p> " If you flip Facebook 's need for real IDs to anonymous accounts , then you get an app like Whisper , " Liew says . " If you flip Facebook 's need for permanence to impermanence , you get Snapchat . " <p> If you flip Facebook 's need for real IDs to anonymous accounts , then you get an app like Whisper . If you flip Facebook 's need for permanence to impermanence , you get Snapchat . <p> Liew is constantly on the hunt for under-the-radar trends like that . One of his favourite resources is PageData . PageData shows which pages are trending on Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Walker 's page following his sudden death ) , others hint at investment opportunities . <p> Last year , Liew noticed pages with memes , or text-and-picture content , were trending . When he saw Whisper and Snapchat , he realised those housed the same type of content . Sites like LOLCats and PerezHilton had been creating that type of content for years ; Snapchat and Whisper were bringing the experience to mobile devices . <p> Now Liew is noticing publications like Viral Nova and Upworthy , which are driving rapid growth through social sharing . PolicyMic , a media startup that has quickly grown to 8 million monthly readers , is one of Liew 's investments . <p> Liew is also interested in Bitcoin startups , as well as startups that are applying big data to financial services . <p> While Liew has invested in all kinds of consumer startups and entrepreneurs , there 's something they have in common . <p> " We believed in the vision of each team , as well as the teams themselves , " Liew says of his investments . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get to them quickly . Also , they were outside of the typical investment cycle . "
