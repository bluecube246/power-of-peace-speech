Break the carbon curse to curb global emissions

Regardless of economic strength or level of development , countries with substantial fossil fuel resources are almost certain to be heavy carbon polluters -- a phenomenon dubbed the " carbon curse " .  A study by Oxford University academics Joerg Friedrichs and Oliver Inderwildi published today in the journal Energy Policy suggests policy makers should turn to the fuel-rich nations first to start reducing carbon emissions . With more resources such as coal , oil , or gas to waste , invariably such countries are the worst polluters .  While this may seem obvious on the surface , the authors identify four mechanisms at work . Extracting the resource is energy intensive ( oil drilling , coal mining ) and often wasteful ( eg , gas flaring ) . Cheap , plentiful fuel means a low incentive to invest in energy efficiency . Governments are under pressure to offer uneconomic subsidies to citizens who expect to benefit from their nation 's natural resource , and cheap fuel crowds out demand for other forms of energy production such as renewables . Each of these pushes the unit of GDP ) far higher than comparable countries that lack natural resources .  These perverse incentives almost guarantee that fuel-rich countries will struggle to reduce carbon emissions , whether they are developed or developing nations . The 41 countries studied included OPEC petro-states like Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , Iraq , and Nigeria , developed economies including European nations , the US , South Korea , South Africa and Australia , and developing economic powerhouses like China , India and Brazil . In almost every case , the fuel rich nations suffered the carbon curse , with high emissions and high inefficiencies . The only countries to buck the trend were Norway and the UK -- both fuel producing states that nevertheless achieved lower carbon emissions and energy efficiency .  Dr Friedrichs said the analysis offered an alternative way of approaching climate change discussions that moved away from the " blame game " played out between established and developing economies , where each demands the other make emissions reductions .  " Policy makers should be aware that the main division is not between advanced and emerging economies . " If you want to understand why a country has a high carbon intensity , it will tell you more to look at resources than other economic indicators . Put simply , scarcity leads to responsible use of a resource ; abundance the opposite . "  Even countries such as Germany -- among Europe 's strongest advocate for renewables and emissions reduction -- faired poorly because it produces and uses large amounts of lignite , a highly polluting brown coal . Likewise Australia and Canada were brought down by their coal and tar sands industries .  Dr Dabo Guan , senior lecturer in environmental economics and governance at Leeds University , said that climate change discussions hinged on whether governments sought " low carbon " or merely " lower carbon " solutions . For example , as carbon intensity is expressed in relation to GDP , it can be driven down by substantially increasing GDP , rather than lowering overall emissions . Of course in the course of manufacturing , processing , and selling more things to increase GDP , carbon emissions would inevitably also rise substantially -- : " In climate negotiations India and China talk about relative , ' lower carbon ' targets and relative indicators , not absolute targets for low emissions . China says by 2020 it will reduce carbon intensity by 45% , but if the economy continues to grow and GDP increases more than emissions , doing so is no problem . " Producing 40% of the world 's steel , 60% of concrete and around half of the world 's metal processing , China 's unencumbered economy can produce considerable income , and emissions .  The product of a huge amount of these emissions are in any case destined for the less-polluting West . " Norway , the UK , the West -- we rely heavily on imported oil and gas from Africa , Asia and the Middle East . We have essentially outsourced our emissions to these countries , " Dr Guan said .  A further problem is that countries that have lowered carbon emissions to a certain level experience diminishing returns on the huge amount of money spent to lower them further . Better instead , globally speaking easier to implement measures have not yet been taken . Unfortunately these are the states whose often corrupt or powerful controlling elites have the least incentive to do so , or where wasteful practices such as gas flaring from oil wells are commonplace despite electricity black outs and fuel poverty among the people .  Dr Friedrichs suggests the answer is for petro-states to fund R&amp;D in high-tech nations so that the fruits of their combined cash and labour -- technologies like carbon capture and storage or supercritical steam generators for efficient power plants - can be offered back to the developing world , for everyone 's benefit .  One of numerous thorny political questions in climate negotiations . But while it is easier said than achieved , the achievements of Norway and the UK show that it is possible , with the right policies and determination to act , for states to break the spell of fossil fuels and lift the carbon curse .
