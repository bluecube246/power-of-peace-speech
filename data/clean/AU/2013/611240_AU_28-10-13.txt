newsat 's $600 million satellite could see it join australia 's largest businesses , or crash  tuesday , 29 october 2013 0:31  myriam robin  share  on the outskirts of adelaide sits what 's called a teleport . it receives and transmits satellite signals to geostationary satellites , and sells that bandwidth on to third parties .  it 's one of two teleports owned by newsat . the other is in perth . due to a mix of low rainfall , geographical position , state-of-the-art engineering and political stability , both teleports are considered some of the best places in the world from which to secure satellite bandwidth , offering up-times of nearly 100% .  newsat , a microcap satellite company listed on the asx , does not currently own any satellites . it 's a middle man . it buys bandwidth from the handful of major satellite companies and sells it on to governments and companies in the telecommunications and resource industry . but that 's about to change .  for the past few months , newsat 's ceo , to raise the $600 million necessary to build and launch a satellite .  it was n't easy . when he started , his company had a market capitalisation of just $60 million .  but he 's pulled it off . through a mix of export development funds and institutional investment , newsat has the money to build its first satellite . jabiru 1 is due to lift off in 2015 . if that launch is successful , newsat will be well on track to become one of australia 's largest , most profitable companies .  the barriers to entry in building , launching and operating satellites are extraordinary . but as governments and corporations increase their usage of high-quality communications their need for satellite bandwidth grows .  for companies able to offer new satellites , there 's a huge amount of money to be made . and newsat is looking to cash in .  " the reason we 're launching a satellite is because we just ca n't get enough capacity from other vendors , " ballintine tells smartcompany .  " at the moment , satellite producers , we add value services to do it , and we on-sell that bandwidth . that 's a 30% margin business .  " by launching our own satellite , we become masters of our own capacity , and we go from a 30% margin business to an 80% margin business . "  that 's why he could raise the money . the demand for satellite bandwidth is huge . already , jabiru 1 has sold 20% of its capacity -- bringing in $800 million . once it 's launched , ballintine says it could bring in $3 billion in revenue , with earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation ( ebitda ) of at least $150 million a year .  and that 's just one satellite . newsat owns eight orbital slots . there are 160 in the world ( one for every two degrees along the equator ) . into the eight slots it owns , newsat can put 20 satellites . it 's already got plans for jabiru 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .  newsat got its start through million in 2005 when its previous owners decided to sell their australian operations . they 're very good teleports , but there are 1700 in the world overall . ownership of the teleports was n't enough to break into the satellite game .  that took financing . a lot of it .  the bulk of the money came on loan from the american and french governments .  building the satellite will create 1000 jobs at lockheed martin in the united states . and building the launcher will create 600 jobs at french company arianespace .  " both those governments spent a year doing due diligence on our contracts and our projects , and decided to lend us $400 million at 2% interest per annum . that 's why export money is the best money you can get . it 's cheap money , because you 're providing jobs . "  newsat itself directly employs 75 people . but the hundreds of temporary jobs it would create in the united states and france got it $400 million in funding . newsat then put $50 million of its million , and raised equity worth $100 million .  when it came to private investors , the bulk of interest came from the us and uk .  " initially , we were laughed out of everyone 's offices in australia , " ballintine says . " we were a little company raising $600 million in a financial community that had no way of understanding anything about satellite technology . australian analysts understand resources , and digging holes . it was just the wrong place to start . so we started in markets that understood space and satellites .  " funding the first satellite is murder . the due diligence we had to go through was an enormous task . " but since they started , newsat 's market cap has risen from $60 million to $300 million . as the company gets bigger , raising the funds for satellites will get easier .  but one huge risk remains : that of the satellite crashing to the ground .  that 's why newsat is going with arianespace to build its launcher . the french company has n't satellite is big . by global standards it 's huge . ballantine says realistically , arianespace was the only company who had a launcher big enough to carry it .  the technical aspects of the satellite and launcher are wholly built to minimise risk . the satellite design aims to change as little as possible from previous successful launches , so as not to introduce any new design flaws . satellites stay up for at least 15 years , so the engineers are highly conservative , using only materials that have been tried and tested as opposed to the newest innovations . as one of newsat 's engineers said to smartcompany : " if a bolt has n't flown before , we do n't want it . "  if all else fails , newsat pays $36 million in insurance premiums every year . it also owns the orbital slot next door , so it could migrate some of the contracts it 's already sold to jabiru 2 , which it hopes to launch a few months after the first satellite .  but launch failure would be a huge even though there has n't been an arianespace failure in 57 launches , an explosion is always a risk , " ballintine says .  if it works though , the possibilities are extraordinary . newsat could come from virtually nowhere to being one of australia 's largest companies .  the sums speak for themselves .  ballintine says satellite companies typically trade at multiples of between eight to 12 times ebitda .  the ebitda on newsat 's first satellite is close to $200 million . if newsat launches five , that 's a billion in ebitda right there , which you 'd then multiply by at least eight to get a multibillion dollar market capitalisation .  " it 's not just a wild stab , " ballintine says . " if we get our act right , and we launch multiple satellites ... there 's no question this could be a very large company indeed .
