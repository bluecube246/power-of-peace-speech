<h> Flight Centre loses ACCC case with CEOs emails scrutinised <p> Flight Centre chief Graham Turner remains defiant after his company lost a case brought against it by the ACCC on Friday . <p> The Brisbane Federal Court found Flight Centre guilty of six counts of attempting to induce competitors to enter into price-fixing arrangements with it . <p> The competition regulator argued that on six occasions between 2005 and 2009 , Flight Centre attempted to induce Singapore Airlines , Malaysian Airlines and Emirates to agree to stop offering prices cheaper than those offered by Flight Centre ( all three airlines rejected the advances ) . <p> As part of its case , the ACCC argued that as Flight Centre 's prices include both its commission and the cost of the flight , discouraging airlines from selling below this price has the effect of preventing competition between Flight Centre and the airline 's internal sales divisions . <p> Speaking to SmartCompany when the case was first brought against the travel company last year , Turner was adamant he would n't seek a settlement . <p> " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd contemplate a settlement . We need to look after our customers and ensure they have the best fares . We make no apology for that , " he said . <p> Turner was overseas when the judgement was delivered and so unable to speak to SmartCompany this time around . But in a written statement , Turner again signalled his intention to continue fighting the case . <p> " Having access to all offers is a logical and natural business request for an agent to make to ensure the customers it serves are not disadvantaged , " he said . <p> " The ruling is likely to have implications for the travel industry and for many retailers and agents in other sectors . " <p> In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange , Flight Centre indicated it would appeal the Federal Court ruling . <p> " Based on a preliminary analysis of the judge 's findings , the company believes there are errors of law that will form the basis of its appeal . <p> " The company does not expect the test case ruling to affect its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a narrow area of activity between 2005 and 2009 . " <p> The case was largely decided on internal and external Flight Centre emails , many of them written by Turner , which Justice Logan said showed Flight Centre and the airlines were in clear competition with each other , and thus an attempt to reach an agreement on pricing was price-fixing . <p> One email , sent to Singapore airlines , made reference to instances where the airline had " undercut " Flight Centre 's prices . <p> " These reduced margins this year have made it difficult at times for us ... and recognition of this issue will help us to achieve our collective goals , " it said . <p> Flight Centre 's lawyers argued it was not in direct competition with the airlines . But based on the emails , Justice Logan disagreed . <p> Michael Terceiro , a legal consultant and former ACCC lawyer who worked on the ACCC 's case against Flight Centre , says Turner appears to have " shot himself in the foot " with the emails . <p> " Justice Logan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he said showed a competitive mindset . " <p> By basing his judgement on such documents , Justice Logan has made it difficult for Flight Centre to appeal , Terceiro added . <p> In an appeal , Flight Centre would n't be able to have the evidence re-evaluated , but would instead have to base its argument on a point of law . If the ruling , however , was largely based on witness evidence , it narrows the scope of an appeal . <p> Penalties for price-fixing behaviour can be hefty . At a penalty hearing , Justice Logan will decide between a penalty of $10 million , 10% of Flight Centre 's yearly revenue , or three times the financial gain from the price-fixing . <p> Flight Centre was not successful in its price-fixing attempts , which leaves the first two potential penalties . It is quite likely the ACCC will push for Flight Centre to be fined 10% of its revenue , Terceiro says . <p> " Flight Centre did n't succeed , so that suggests a low penalty . But a couple of factors hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was involved in the conduct , and there 'll be no discounts for cooperation or contrition . <p> " Once the penalty is decided on , Flight Centre can appeal . But they might decide not to . " <p> The case bears remarkable similarities to one recently brought by the ACCC against ANZ , which it lost last November , Terceiro adds . <p> In that case , the ACCC alleged that ANZ had engaged in price-fixing behaviour when threatened to remove Mortgage Refunds ' accreditation to sell its mortgages unless the broker capped its refunds at $600 , allowing ANZ to match the price . <h> Myriam Robin <p> Myriam Robin is a reporter for SmartCompany and its sister site LeadingCompany .
