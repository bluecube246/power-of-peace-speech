Australian Scientists Discover Human-Caused Global Warming From The 1930 's  The last 16 record-breaking hot years globally clearly show the influence of human caused climate change with the first signs appearing as far back as the 1930s , according to new Australian research released today .  " Globally all the record-breaking hot years we 've had since the 1990s are so much outside natural variability that they would be almost impossible without climate change caused by humans , " said Dr Andrew King , from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science .  But even at country and regional scales , where it is often much harder to detect global warming signals , the influence of human caused climate change still became unmistakable in many regions in the 1990s and for Australia as far back as 1980 .  " In Australia our research showed the last six record-breaking hot years and last three record-breaking hot summers were made much more likely due to global warming , " said lead author , Dr King .  " We were able to see in the Southern Hemisphere in the middle of the ocean , far away from the cooling influence of high concentrations of industrial aerosols . "  Previous research has shown that aerosols in high concentrations over specific regions had a cooling effect , reflecting more heat back into space . However , when those aerosols were removed from the atmosphere , the warming returned rapidly .  This cooling impact was seen very clearly by the researchers when they looked at five different regions , Central England , Central Europe , Central US , East Asia and Australia .  Cooling periods , likely caused by aerosols , occurred in Central England , Central US , Central Europe and East Asia during the 1960s and 1970s before accelerated warming returned . These heightened aerosol concentrations also delayed the emergence of a clear human caused climate change signal in all regions studied except Australia .  " In regards to a regional human caused climate change signal , Australia was the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the world . The signal appeared there first and then over the said .  " Recent increases in aerosols over East Asia has started to slow the rise in the number of the region 's record hot years and summers , again masking the clear climate change signal we are finding in other areas .  " High aerosol concentrations also significantly delayed the climate signal in the Central US . "  To get their results the researchers took a new approach . In the past , most researchers searching for a human caused climate change signal selected specific events and then tried to determine the role of climate change in those events .  By contrast , this study looked at when events started exceeding the range of natural variability . Using climate models , they looked at a world without human produced greenhouse gases and compared it to a world where the composition of the atmosphere corresponded with those found over time in the real world .  Where real world observations rose above the range of natural variability produced in climate models showing temperatures in a world without industrial activity , this indicated the unequivocal influence of human climate change signal for extreme heat events is becoming stronger . The key now is to determine how much warmer the climate will continue to get , so we can respond to the impacts this will inevitably bring , " said Dr King .  " This is particularly true for Australia , which appears to have one of the strongest climate change signals for a populated country . As a nation , it will need to respond more quickly and understand clearly what future climate change brings . "  Join the discussion !
