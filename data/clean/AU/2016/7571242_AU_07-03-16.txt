<p> Australian researchers are calling for a national strategy to maintain or improve physical function in older stroke survivors . <p> The team from the University of Newcastle used 15 years of data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 's Health , and found many who survived stroke lived longer than 15 years with poor physical function . <p> Lead author Isobel Hubbard said she found that few recovered from the low levels of physical function after suffering a stroke . <p> Dr Hubbard said it showed physicians needed to reconsider the support and rehabilitation programs that improved quality of life . <p> Perhaps we 've assumed that this group did n't need too many healthcare resources because they simply were n't going to live very long . <p> Isobel Hubbard , Newcastle researcher <p> " Over 50 per cent of women with stroke were surviving over 10 years . A quarter of those who surviving even with poor physical function , " she said . <p> " That means that they 're not able to get up a flight of stairs , or easily pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's really quite an extraordinary outcome . " <p> Dr Hubbard said given many of the women could expect to live for a significant amount of time , doctors needed to think about improving their quality of life . <p> " The tend to be a group that have perhaps have gone under everybody 's radar , " she said . <p> " Perhaps we 've assumed that this group did n't need too many healthcare resources because they simply were n't going to live very long . <p> " But now we know , in fact , that is not necessarily true . <p> " So I think we just need to re-look at what we 're offering this particular group of women . " <p> The results have been published in the American Heart Association journal , Stroke . <p> There are supposed to be checks and balances that would prevent Donald Trump doing too much damage as US president . But these have been eroded and an era of " imperial presidency " means we should be worried , writes Chris Berg .
