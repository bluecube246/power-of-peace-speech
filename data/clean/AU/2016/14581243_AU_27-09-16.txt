<p> The handlebar moustache , the ungainly action , the portly physique of an ambling medium-pacer with a few too many beers on board , it all endeared him to the Australian public like few cricketers before him . <p> " He was just a really down-to-earth , humorous guy . He 's never lost for words . He was just good fun , " former Test bowler Bob Massie told the ABC . <p> Massie can lay claim to one of the greatest swing bowling performances in Australian Test history , when he took 16 for 137 on debut against England at Lord 's in 1972 . <p> But Walker , who more or less replaced Massie in the Test team in 1973 , was a different beast to the technically perfect West Australian . <p> ' Tangles ' approached Massie in the nets one day and asked how to bowl out-swingers -- Walker and his bizarre bowling action only produced in-swing deliveries to that point . <p> Massie showed him the traditional delivery style but Walker was a unique beast . <p> " He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up doing it with one finger , " Massie said . <p> " He was so used to bowling the in-swinger , where you roll your fingers around the ball to get the seam going in , and he found with two fingers he could n't get out of that habit , so he did it with one finger . " <h> Walker identified media opportunities before most <p> Already a fan favourite , his post-playing career as an author and media personality gave him a kind of cult status in Australian culture . <p> Walker carved out a piece of the sport broadcasting landscape with Channel Nine 's flagship program , Wide World Of Sports . <p> Massie suggested Walker made it look easier than it actually was , but the Hobart native had identified sponsorship and advertising as a great avenue for athletes to make money before most Aussie sportsmen .
