the handlebar moustache , the ungainly action , the portly physique of an ambling medium-pacer with a few too many beers on board , it all endeared him to the australian public like few cricketers before him .  " he was just a really down-to-earth , humorous guy . he 's never lost for words . he was just good fun , " former test bowler bob massie told the abc .  massie can lay claim to one of the greatest swing bowling performances in australian test history , when he took 16 for 137 on debut against england at lord 's in 1972 .  but walker , who more or less replaced massie in the test team in 1973 , was a different beast to the technically perfect west australian .  ' tangles ' approached massie in the nets one day and asked how to bowl out-swingers -- walker and his bizarre bowling action only produced in-swing deliveries to that point .  massie showed him the traditional delivery style but walker was a unique beast .  " he could n't ended up doing it with one finger , " massie said .  " he was so used to bowling the in-swinger , where you roll your fingers around the ball to get the seam going in , and he found with two fingers he could n't get out of that habit , so he did it with one finger . "  walker identified media opportunities before most  already a fan favourite , his post-playing career as an author and media personality gave him a kind of cult status in australian culture .  walker carved out a piece of the sport broadcasting landscape with channel nine 's flagship program , wide world of sports .  massie suggested walker made it look easier than it actually was , but the hobart native had identified sponsorship and advertising as a great avenue for athletes to make money before most aussie sportsmen .
