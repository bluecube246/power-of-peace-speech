The handlebar moustache , the ungainly action , the portly physique of an ambling medium-pacer with a few too many beers on board , it all endeared him to the Australian public like few cricketers before him .  " He was just a really down-to-earth , humorous guy . He 's never lost for words . He was just good fun , " former Test bowler Bob Massie told the ABC .  Massie can lay claim to one of the greatest swing bowling performances in Australian Test history , when he took 16 for 137 on debut against England at Lord 's in 1972 .  But Walker , who more or less replaced Massie in the Test team in 1973 , was a different beast to the technically perfect West Australian .  ' Tangles ' approached Massie in the nets one day and asked how to bowl out-swingers -- Walker and his bizarre bowling action only produced in-swing deliveries to that point .  Massie showed him the traditional delivery style but Walker was a unique beast .  " He could n't ended up doing it with one finger , " Massie said .  " He was so used to bowling the in-swinger , where you roll your fingers around the ball to get the seam going in , and he found with two fingers he could n't get out of that habit , so he did it with one finger . "  Walker identified media opportunities before most  Already a fan favourite , his post-playing career as an author and media personality gave him a kind of cult status in Australian culture .  Walker carved out a piece of the sport broadcasting landscape with Channel Nine 's flagship program , Wide World Of Sports .  Massie suggested Walker made it look easier than it actually was , but the Hobart native had identified sponsorship and advertising as a great avenue for athletes to make money before most Aussie sportsmen .
