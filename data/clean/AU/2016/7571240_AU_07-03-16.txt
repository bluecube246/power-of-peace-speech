streaking through space at more than 14 kilometres a second , tx68 is on the way . photo : the age  an earth-bound asteroid , dubbed 2013 tx68 , could pass well within the ring of communications and gps satellites that orbit more than 35,000 kilometres above the equator , scientists warn .  " we know the asteroid will miss earth - but it 's possible that it may pass within the range of some orbiting satellites that make the satnav system on your phone possible , " said swinburne university astrophysicist dr alan duffy .  the minimum distance of closest approach is around 24,000 kilometres .  dr kurt liffman , astrophysicist  australia has several satellites in orbit around the earth , including several owned by telecommunications giant optus and one by westpac bank .  spud-shaped asteroids like this come from the densely populated asteroid belt , between mars and jupiter . photo : joanne crawford  " satellites are tiny targets in the huge emptiness of space - so it would be incredibly unlucky for australia or any nation to . " that said , a hit can not be entirely ruled out . "  advertisement  another swinburne astrophysicist , dr kurt liffman , agrees . " the minimum distance of closest approach is around 24,000 kilometres , which would take the asteroid within range of some of our key satellites , " dr liffman said .  an optus spokesperson said : " as an experienced satellite operator , optus closely monitors information published by the international space community on activities that are relevant to satellite operations . "  the company has six satellites , making it the largest fleet servicing australia , new zealand and antarctica . one satellite operates at 152 degrees east , two at 156 degrees east , one at 160 degrees east and two at 164 degrees east .  " since commencing satellite operations in 1985 , optus has experienced no adverse effects on its satellite fleet resulting from fly-bys of any asteroids and is confident that 2013 tx68 poses no threat to our current fleet , " mr murray said .  heading towards earth at more than 14 kilometres and about the weight of sydney 's harbour bridge , follows an elliptical , egg-shaped route as it orbits the sun , routinely crossing our path .  during the last lap two years ago , the space rock flew by at the reassuringly safe distance of more than 2 million kilometres .  odds are one in 250 million that the near-earth asteroid could hit next time round -- namely on september 28 next year , the experts say . fly bys in 2046 and 2097 have a lower probability of impact .  " tx68 is likely three times the mass of the asteroid that exploded above chelyabinsk in russia in february , 2013 , " said dr duffy .  " were tx68 ever to hit earth in some future orbit , it would probably explode in the atmosphere -- creating an enormous air blast with twice the energy of chelyabinsk , damaging buildings and injury to people . "  as two-thirds of earth 's surface is covered by water , most asteroids of this kind tend to disintegrate harmlessly above the ocean .  although nasa than 90 per cent of asteroids of one kilometre or more across , there are many smaller objects that could potentially collide with earth in the future .
