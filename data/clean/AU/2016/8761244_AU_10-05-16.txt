<h> AFL <h> Malthouse : Pies did not need Bucks ' list overhaul <p> Collingwood 's list did not need a major overhaul after Nathan Buckley became coach in 2012 and were on the verge of a mini-dynasty , says Mick Malthouse . <p> The former Magpies premiership coach says that Buckley 's sweeping changes to the club were n't necessary . <p> " I thought the club was on the verge of a mini-dynasty because it was one of the youngest premiership sides in recent history . I thought we were had a pretty good side , " Malthouse said on SEN Breakfast . <p> " Heath Shaw was one of the best and fairest at Greater Western Sydney last year . ( Sharrod ) Wellingham played in a Grand Final last year . <p> " If you want players out and you bring players in , you bring them in to make it your own side and that 's your prerogative . Whether or not that 's the right thing , history will show whether it is right or wrong . " <p> However he understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have . <p> " I think when Nathan Buckley took that job over , that was his side . He had to do it how he wanted to do it , " said Malthouse . <p> Malthouse also touched on the pressure surrounding other coaches in the AFL , particularly Suns coach Rodney Eade . <p> He says that Guy McKenna 's sacking from the Suns was a mistake for a club that needed stability in its formative years . <p> " Really they have done nothing in that two years ( since McKenna 's sacking ) , yet he was an instigator in getting that side in a position where he had some terrific young men coming through and they just needed to settle and they have n't gone with it , " Malthouse said . <p> The three time premiership coach believes that each coach currently facing scrutiny needs to be assessed individually . <p> " I do n't necessarily think you should always attack the coach . I think everyone should be looked at realistically and have a close look at what is really taking place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Realistically , there are sides who are going to be certainties in the eight and there is going to be those that go from say fifth to tenth and it 's only a minor adjustment of losing a couple of key players ( that hurts their chances of playing finals ) . <p> " I know what it was like at Carlton last year . Our best and fairest winner was Bryce Gibbs the previous year . He hurt his shoulder in the first game and then Daisy Thomas went down . All of a sudden your plans of being able to dominate the middle or have some capacity in the middle to win games of football evaporate pretty quickly . <p> " I think instead of jumping over and on top of these blokes , we need to examine why some of these things are taking place .
