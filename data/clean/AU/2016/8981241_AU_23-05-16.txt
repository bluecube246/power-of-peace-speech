<h> What is altitude sickness ? <p> The fierce winds and thick frost freeze them in time . Instant rigor mortis . The dead keeping an eternal post atop the roof of the world . <p> Maria Strydom , who died on a climb to the summit of Mount Everest , with her husband , Robert Gropal .

Less than a fifth are -- the cost , in terms of resources and the risk to others ' lives , is often judged too high . <p> ' Green Boots ' was the name given to the unidentified corpse of a climber that became a landmark on the main Northeast ridge route of Mount Everest . Photo : Supplied <p> Maria -- sometimes self-styled as Marisa -- died after severe altitude sickness caused her brain to swell . She and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gropel , a vet in Melbourne 's north-east , has been evacuated by helicopter from Camp 2 and is now in Kathmandu . His parents flew from Melbourne to Kathmandu on Monday to be with their son , who is battling a build-up of fluid in his lungs , known as a high altitude pulmonary oedema . <p> The journey to the top of Everest is sign-posted by the marks of the dead , and oftentimes by the bodies . The vast majority lie within the " death zone " , the final 400 metres to the top . <p> A line of climbers on the Lhotse Face , Mount Everest .

In 2014 , 15 sherpas died in an avalanche on the slopes . <p> ' Green Boots ' is among the more famous dead . A bright pair of green ski shoes sticking out of a cave , at 8500 metres . First seen in 2001 , in 2015 , the BBC mounted an investigation to identify the body , eventually naming a young Indian climber , Tsewang Paljor , as the owner of the distinctive boots . However , other theories abound as to the true identity of the dead climber . <p> In 2014 , the green boots disappeared , presumed buried in the snow . <p> Yet some suggest the body was blown down the mountain . That has been known to happen . <p> Hannelore Schmatz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her backpack with her eyes wide open , for much of the 80s and 90s , her hair blowing in Everest 's gale-force winds . <p> They may have also seen Francys Arsentiev 's flag-draped body . She reached the summit in 1998 , but became separated from her husband and climbing partner on the descent , and died . In 2007 , a climber who had been present during her death scaled the mountain again so he could cover her prone body with an American flag . <p> On the way there , Dr Strydom and her husband might have passed through " Rainbow Valley " , named after the number of corpses in bright climbing jackets . <p> Determined to reach the top as a cyclone approached , Dr Strydom 's small party headed for the summit in darkness .
