schoolboy q dreams of a world with " no guns "  in an interview with montreality , schoolboy q has wholly denounced guns , saying that they are the one evil he would rid the world of if he could . the artist has just released his new album blank face , and in spite of its aggressuve , gangsta themes , he has a lot to say about their place and responsibility in today 's world .  " n****s need to take away guns . from officers , from everybody . it should be no guns , " q stated . that 's a pretty huge deal coming from a guy who 's arguably seen as today 's modern gangsta rapper . he 's got no shortage of tracks that discuss and even seem to glamourise gun use and ownership -- a result of having joined the hoover crips at the tender age of 13 . john muir , a track from his new album blank face lp , addresses this pretty directly . but does n't that make his words worth all the guns , with guns as an integral part of his formative years and much of his life , and he believes that guns simply should not exist anymore . he decried rappers ' talk about guns , saying " n**** you ai n't gangsta no more , n***** you a rapper . "  of course , q acknowledges that his vision of a world without guns is not ever likely to come to fruition . " it 's impossible to take all the guns , " he conceded . " so , what i want is for the impossible to happen . because it 'll never happen . but ... if they could 've never made guns , i think that 'd be a whole lot better . "  with the number of mass shootings in the usa this year alone climbing to over 130 ( including the tragic orlando shooting at the pulse nightclub , dubbed the deadliest mass shooting in us history ) , q 's statements are timely and important . it 's likely that before the year is over , there will have been around the us -- last year saw 372 . the conversation surrounding gun control is reaching critical mass in the wake of the death of five police officers in the dallas shooting , and public figures lending their support to gun restriction is always a positive thing . but the numbers keep climbing , and so far , nothing is changing . perhaps q is right about this being an impossible cause -- but we take our hats off to him for using his voice in the fight .
