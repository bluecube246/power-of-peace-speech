Reference  Climate friendly businesses moving ahead as Paris Agreement is signed  Monica Richter , WWF 2 May 2016  Australia 's signing of the Paris Agreement at the end of April was an historic event . It is the first time the world has struck an accord on one of the greatest global challenges of our time -- climate change .  There were 175 parties ( 174 countries and the European Union ) who signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change during a ceremony at the UN 's New York Headquarters , far exceeding the historical record for first-day signatures to an international agreement .  The signing of the Paris Agreement comes at a time when planetary temperatures and climate impacts are being felt across the globe . March was the warmest month ever , following 11 straight months of record global temperatures . One of the worst droughts ever experienced has hit eastern and southern Africa , 93 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef has been bleached as a result of warming sea temperatures , and Greenland 's ice a few of the climate impacts already taking place .  The path forward is clear for all businesses , supply chains and investment portfolios . We must achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century , build resilience against the climate impacts we will inevitably face , and put in place measures to ensure global financial systems move rapidly towards financing low and zero energy and climate-resilient investments .  Smart businesses are recognising the opportunity this presents and signing up to science-based greenhouse gas emission targets . These companies have begun their own transition toward net zero emissions , the use of renewable energy , deploying innovative low-carbon technologies , sustainably sourcing resources , and much more .  In Australia , Bank Australia , Infigen Energy , Origin Energy , Teachers Mutual and Westpac are among those who have committed to setting science-based targets for reducing their greenhouse gas pollution .  Just last week , Investa pledged its commitment to reducing its emissions , which is a first for an Australian property company . There are many more Australian companies yet to make public announcements science-based pollution reduction target .  But these businesses ca n't do it alone . Current market and regulatory conditions in Australia need to be far more ambitious to drive the required changes towards net zero carbon pollution , and to create an environment that provides incentives for innovation and risk taking .  With greater clarity on the direction of travel and a consistent policy framework , companies will play a major role in closing the emissions gap left by country commitments , and as such they can be the best partners for governments to deliver their ambitious pollution reduction targets .  By making a commitment to achieving 100 per cent renewable electricity in Australia by 2030 and net zero emissions before 2050 , the next Australian federal government can create the right conditions for Australia 's next boom -- one driven by innovation and clean , green technology .  Australia has much to gain from participating in the net zero carbon economy , and much to lose if we do n't step up to the plate to meet our climate challenges head on . We hope that made by the above-mentioned companies , provides the momentum we need for a race to the top in Australia on climate policy .
