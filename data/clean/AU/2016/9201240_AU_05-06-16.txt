NSW wild weather forces hundreds to evacuate  An urgent evacuation warning has been issued for low-lying parts of a southern Sydney suburb .  The SES is advising people around Woronora , east of Cronulla , to pack medicines , important documents , spare clothing and mementos and leave the area by 11pm on Sunday .  " Do not delay your evacuation . Roads will be congested or closed , " the SES warns .  " You could become trapped and need rescue . Remaining in flooded areas is dangerous and may place your life at risk . "  The warning has been issued after the Woronora flooded to dangerous levels on Sunday evening and will stay in place until authorities deem the area safe .  Earlier on Sunday , residents in low-lying parts of Milperra and East Hills were told to leave home within three hours as the storm continues to hammer Sydney .  Nearby Chipping Norton was also evacuated and a major flood warning has been issued for the upper reaches of the Nepean River .  About 70 recorded at Ingleburn .  One woman has been charged with drink-driving after she was rescued from flood waters in the Illawarra region , police say .  Emergency Services Minister David Elliott has warned people not to take the risk .  ' You would n't walk into a bushfire so why would you drive into floodwaters ? ' he asked reporters in Sydney .  According to Ausgrid , 25,000 homes are without power and they hope most homes in Sydney 's east and southwill be restored tonight with 700 homes at Bundeena to be restored in the morning .  Ausgrid workers are facing strong winds and fallen trees across the network as they work to restore power , a spokesperson said in a statement.But the biggest concern for authorities is the surf , with a 12-metre wave recorded at Botany Bay on Sunday .  Abnormally high tides are predicted all along the state 's coast and five to seven-metre waves may cause erosion and sea water flooding of low lying areas .  The storm is expected to clear Sydney on Sunday night but will smash another 100mm on the already-soaked region , before moving south towards Tasmania .
