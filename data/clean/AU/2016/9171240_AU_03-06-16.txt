gordon to decide if he wants to resign : trad  queensland 's acting premier says it is up to controversial mp billy gordon to decide if he should resign from parliament following his drink driving charge .  jackie trad would not be drawn on her personal opinions about mr gordon 's political future at a press conference in toowoomba , west of brisbane , on thursday .  ' what he decides to do in terms of his seat in parliament will be entirely up to him . '  a drink driving conviction would not affect mr gordon 's position in parliament and other mps have retained their seats long after similar incidents , including former labor mp karen struthers , who went on to be a minister in the bligh government .  mr gordon , who is one of a handful of crossbenchers to control the balance of power in state parliament , was pulled over on the kennedy highway near kuranda , north of cairns , just before 11pm on wednesday .  it is alleged he returned a blood alcohol 's licence at the time .  he was charged with drink driving and driving without a licence .  the cook mp released a statement on thursday which stated there was ' no excuse ' for his decision to get behind the wheel but said he 'd been affected by a recent death in the family .  ' i remain focused on my role and my passion for representing the people of cook , ' he said .  ' at a time when my community needs me , i allowed personal life matters to cloud my judgment . '  mr gordon has been issued with a notice to appear in mareeba magistrates court on june 27 .  mr gordon won the seat of cook , which takes in port douglas , cape york and the torres strait , at the 2015 election as a labor member , helping the party to form a minority government .  but he was forced out of the party over domestic violence accusations from a former partner , of which he was later cleared , and has remained a key relying on his vote to pass legislation
