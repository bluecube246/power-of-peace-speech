ELECTION LATEST  Jak governor emerges after questioning  By  AAP  When Jakarta 's governor emerged from more than nine hours of questioning over allegations of blasphemy , his message was short and sweet .  " I want to go home now , I 'm hungry . "  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama , commonly known as Ahok , has been the centre of a political maelstrom since an edited video of him speaking to constituents in the Thousand Islands , north of Jakarta , in September went viral and inflamed hardline Muslims across Indonesia .
