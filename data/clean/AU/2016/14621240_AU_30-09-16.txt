hot toys ' new rogue one figures are all about the empire  when you need a bunch of fancy action figures to be out as soon as possible to coincide with the launch of a new movie , it 's good to be bad -- especially if you 're the faceless entities of an evil empire . which means if you want some rogue one hot toys , then what you 're getting for the foreseeable future is all things imperial . now that it 's september 30 , the company has revealed a few more more " new " rogue one figures to celebrate the arrival of the movie 's merch on toy shelves . i say " new " because really , the only new figure joining the death trooper is the shore trooper -- darth vader and the " jedha patrol " stormtrooper are just minor tweaks to existing toys .  but still , they look nice . vader is a bit different to the a new hope-specific toy hot toys released a while ago , with updated armour details that make sith-era vader than the one of the original trilogy . the new stormtrooper is essentially the old one , dirtied up and given a backpack .  the new shore trooper though , is actually new . the mix of armour and cloth material looks great , and it 's nice to see some imperial troopers who are n't just clad in various shades of white or black .  unlike most hot toys , the figure does n't come with much -- just a stand , some alternate hands and the trooper 's new double-barrelled gun -- but it 's a swanky addition to the sixth-scale imperial army , indeed .  none of the new figures are quite up for pre-order in the west just yet , but vader , the jedha patrol stormtrooper and the shoretrooper are all due for release early next year .  trending stories right now  a series of quakes under the salton sea may be a signal that the san andreas fault is on the verge of buckling . for the next few days , the risk of a major earthquake along which , holy crap .  what we do in the shadows is the only vampire mock-doc the world will ever need , because it is hilarious , raunchy and perfectly self-aware . the werewolf-themed sequel ( genius title . we 're wolves ) is percolating , and now the rumoured tv spin-off is confirmed . but do n't get too excited about the latter just yet .
