How to practise it ?  * Each morning , take five minutes to write down or say aloud three things you are grateful for having in your life right now . It can be something as simple as having a roof over your head , a warm bed to sleep in , food in your fridge , clean running water and electricity , or a great relationship with a family member , a partner or a friend .  or friend , emphasise which of their qualities you are grateful for ( they 're warm , gracious , kind , loving , incredibly funny ) .  2 . KEEP A POSITIVE MINDSET  Why ?  * It helps you manage life 's challenges better .  * It also helps you enjoy life more .  * It puts you in proactive mode ( life is what you make of it ) instead of in reactive mode ( life is what happens to you ) .

How would I benefit from following it ? What do I want to get out of it : approval , knowledge , a shortcut to solving a problem , or to be liked and have more friends ?  10 .
