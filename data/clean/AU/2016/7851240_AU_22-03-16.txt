Review : Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice  Words by Mad Dog BradleyMarch 23 , 2016  Producer/director Zack Snyder 's next-cab-off-the-rank after the darkened-up Superman rethink Man Of Steel is a gargantuan , spoiler-crammed affair that proves so overextended and overcomplicated that it 's almost too much to take in , meaning that by the time we finally get to the titular grudge match you could well be over it . Nevertheless , there are elements here that work strongly and even spectacularly , and yet most of them ca n't be discussed without betraying this one 's many secrets ( and finding yourself attacked by roving , drooling gangs of DC Comic fanboys ) .  While the final battle between Superman ( Henry Cavill ) and crazed Kryptonian General Zod ( Michael Shannon ) is taking place at the end of the previous pic , we cut to the damage it 's doing to Wayne Enterprises , and witness the beginnings of Bruce Wayne 's mistrust of this supposed savior-from-the-skies . And , of course , Wayne is played by Ben Affleck also have a rejigging of the Dark Knight origin story , and apparently are meant to believe that the three Christopher Nolan Batman movies did n't happen , or did n't happen in quite the way we thought .  Anyway , Metropolis ' ' The Superman ' is also wary of Gotham 's ' The Batman ' , and in his guise as Clark Kent he finds time to both investigate this other caped crusader while romancing Lois Lane ( Amy Adams again ) , as Bruce and Alfred ( Jeremy Irons this time ) mull over Superman 's weaknesses back at the Batcave ( although it seems to never be actually called that here ) . And , sensing that these two would-be goodies do n't like each other , Lex Luthor ( Jesse Eisenberg ) uses that to his psychopathic advantage , turning them against each other while cooking up ' Doomsday ' and looning about like a bratty kid in an interpretation of Superman 's chief nemesis quite different from Gene Hackman in the old Christopher Reeve movies . But , of course , Hackman was an here , with an satirical anti-Superman movement led by Senator Finch ( Holly Hunter ) , a barely-explained new character named Diana Prince ( aka you-know-who and played by striking Israeli actress Gal Gadot ) and the expected and exhausting FX-clogged , city-crushing climax all contributing to a running-time of 153 seriously expensive minutes . And how much more can be given away ? How many spoilers can safely be betrayed ? Well , here 's one : the subtitle means something , and ... and ... and hey , can you hear the lynch mobs approaching ?  Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice is in cinemas from Thursday , March 24
