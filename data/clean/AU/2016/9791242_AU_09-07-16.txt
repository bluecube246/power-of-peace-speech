Four goals from star forward Jesse Hogan have helped Melbourne to a 32-point AFL win over Fremantle at TIO Stadium in Darwin .  In steamy Top End conditions on Saturday night , the Demons set up the 12.15 ( 87 ) to 8.7 ( 55 ) win with a dominant first half .  Jack Watts booted three goals in the first term as his side leapt to a 29-point lead at the first break , with Melbourne stretching that lead to 50 points in the third quarter before the Dockers mounted a belated challenge .  Demons skipper Nathan Jones inspired with 35 possessions , while former captain Jack Grimes excelled in his first senior game of the season with 32 disposals .  Dom Tyson and Jack Viney were also prominent around the stoppages , where Max Gawn dominated with 43 hit outs , while Tom McDonald was outstanding at the back with 31 touches and 10 marks .  Freo 's Lachie Neale impressed with 33 disposals , but the Dockers came out on the wrong side of a lopsided 465-329 possession count a side that squandered late opportunities to close the gap further .

Melbourne improved to a 7-8 record with the result as they prepare to take on St Kilda next week , while the Dockers remain mired in the bottom three with a 3-12 record .  Both sides emerged with injury concerns , Oscar McDonald was on crutches after the game with an ankle injury and Fremantle skipper David Mundy suffered a concussion .  Lachie Weller was reported in the third quarter after he clattered into Jayden Hunt high while the Demon was bent over to gather the ball .  " The first half we felt was really good and then conditions changed a fair bit as we expected ... it was pretty wet and slippery , " Melbourne coach Paul Roos said .  " It 's good to have a win up here and it 's good to have a win over Freo a lot more to like than dislike about the game . "  Fremantle coach Ross Lyon was disappointed with his side 's early effort coming off their bye .  " It 's not ideal ... I 'm really disappointed , " Lyon said .  " We came with higher expectations but we could n't get near them in the first half , but at least we balanced ( things ) up in the second half .  " But when the game was up for grabs we just looked right off the pace . "
