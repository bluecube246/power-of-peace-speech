" <p> Fremantle coach Ross Lyon was disappointed with his side 's early effort coming off their bye . <p> " It 's not ideal ... I 'm really disappointed , " Lyon said . <p> " We came with higher expectations but we could n't get near them in the first half , but at least we balanced ( things ) up in the second half . <p> " But when the game was up for grabs we just looked right off the pace .
