life through a lens : monaco grand prix  f1 photographer mark sutton talks espn through some of his favourite shots from the monaco grand prix .  sign him up  sutton images  the charity football match is always a good event to kick off the monaco weekend . fernando alonso was the star of the whole thing , of course , with his free kick which was picked up by all the news channels . this shot is of that kick , he curled it over the wall like a pro !  i do n't cover football , never have except from this match every year , but i quite enjoy doing it as it is something quite different to snapping an f1 event . it 's nice to see the drivers having fun in a unique environment , they actually got kicked around a bit by the pro team ! leicester city boss claudio ranieri was there as well -- it 's funny actually , he was there last year without a job and this year he was there as a premier this is what monaco is all about , people associate it with the beautiful and the glamorous and this picture manages to get all of that into one shot . these girls were here for most of the race and it provided a good shot with the backdrop of lewis hamilton and daniel ricciardo fighting for the lead at nouvelle chicane with the yachts in the background . of course , the key is to get cars in to get the whole shot perfect and that 's why i like this one . we tried to get the girls to wave up to us but they were too busy taking pictures of each other to pay much attention !  dickie bow  sutton images  this is the amber lounge fashion show before monaco and daniel ricciardo had showed up a bit late . they get measured for their tailored suits and have a load of make-up done , it 's the full treatment . ricciardo was late so he was running around getting sorted out and then he could n't put his dickie bow on ! i managed to do n't know if he 'd ever put one on before . i do n't know if anyone else was there from red bull , he seemed to be there on his own , but the team loves this sort of thing as it promotes the brand . you can tell ricciardo enjoyed himself ; he did a bit of a dance with the singer on stage with all the energy he usually has .  lewis and the biebs  sutton images  i had a lot of backlash on this on instagram , abuse for justin bieber and lewis hamilton . they seem to be quite polarising figures . a lot of people were asking why he was there and why hamilton gave him the champagne before celebrating with the team , all this stuff . to be honest , at first i thought it was eminem ! we saw a quick glance of him on the big screen and it was only when he wandered past us on the grid that we realised who it was .  it was a bit strange for bieber to just be trying to engage with a younger audience and seeing them both enjoying a pally moment was something a bit different and a reminder of lewis ' fame away from the sport . if there 's a place to watch f1 it 's monaco -- it 's hard not to be impressed with f1 cars when they are flying around the circuit , so close to the wall , so i 'm sure bieber had a good time .  blessed  sutton images  lewis often says he feels " blessed " and he made the most of it on the podium , pointing to the sky and doing the crucifix type shot when celebrating . i guess he was blessed , a bit , because he would n't have won that race without red bull messing up their pit stop . it 's a special place for him , like it is with all the drivers , and he had waited since 2008 to win there again . it was also that 44th win he 's been waiting eight races to claim and cut a big gap to nico rosberg for both hamilton and to the 2016 title fight as a whole .
