a 3d tour of the international space station for all of us wannabe astronauts  video : there 's no shortage of footage showing what life aboard the international space station is like , but unless you 've had a chance to spend some time there , the iss ' sprawling and ever-expanding layout can be confusing . to help make better sense of it , the european space agency has created a narrated video tour of the space station -- and it 's in 3d .  please enable javascript to watch this video .  is it the same as actually spending a few months aboard the iss ? not even close . but for most of us , it 's probably as close as we 'll ever get to experiencing life aboard our planet 's first orbiting outpost .  tags  discuss  um about skylab ? and mir ? iss is definitely the biggest and best but is also definitely not the " first " i know it seems like a small point , but both skylab and mir paved the way space chat i reckon .  trending stories right now  microsoft 's surface laptop-tablet hybrid has gone through a huge number of small , often unnoticeable tweaks in its journey from the original surface pro of 2013 to the current surface pro 4 . while the tablet itself gets a lot of attention for the evolution of its kickstand and touchscreen and angular slate design , the humble type cover , a nearly mandatory accessory , does n't get as much love . microsoft went to pains , though , in the creation of the signature edition version of the type cover -- a slim , slick , refined piece of hardware that represents the best of surface and of microsoft itself .  over the past four winters , we 've tested more than 30 pairs of touchscreen gloves while moving half a ton of tree stumps , ice climbing , standing in a walk-in fridge for nearly three hours , and simply walking and biking around town . the moshi digits are easy to type with and should keep most people 's fingers toasty , though we also involves a trade-off between manoeuvrability and warmth .
