<h> The pressures of IVF treatment and infertility <p> ITS impacts are so great that it has been said to be the silent killer of friendships . <p> But it 's not what you might think . <p> IVF treatment has been hailed the miracle procedure for women and couples unable to conceive naturally since it became available in 1978 . <p> It is now estimated to be responsible for the birth of more than five million babies worldwide . <p> But one of the consequences not often spoken when it comes to IVF is the toll the process can take on recipients ' relationships and friendships , according to Sydney-based counsellor and co-author of Empowered Fertility : A Practical Twelve-Step Guide , Claire Hall . <p> Ms Hall said the IVF process often leads to social breakdowns because it " takes over ( the recipient 's ) life " . <p> " A lot of people going through the IVF cycle can find relationships tend to dwindle , " Ms Hall told news.com.au . <p> " ( The recipients ) might withdraw because they do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Christmas when they 're trying to avoid everyone knowing about it , " she said . <p> " Sometimes it 's useful to prepare a list of standard replies so instead of waiting to get invited to a baby shower or drinks , get to the mirror and role play three or four standard replies to help get you out of it . " <p> News of friends , colleagues and family members who have got pregnant can also add to the stress and frustration for those struggling with infertility while trying to conceive . <p> " One ( of my clients undergoing IVF ) had a baby announcement nearly every day in the office at work recently and found it incredibly hard , " Ms Hall said . <p> " She worked in a nice office environment then suddenly it 's a pregnant environment that she 's not a part of -- all of a sudden she 's out of the club . " <p> Rebecca and Peter Tos with their six week old daughter Mahli , who was born after her mum endured years of IVF **26;99;TOOLONG <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles while undergoing IVF . <p> " More peripheral friendships may not continue but that may be from inconvenience as much as choice , " she said . <p> " If friends go off to have babies , they 're in different life cycle . <p> " If a couple does n't have children they will build up other social circles and find other couples who want to go out on Friday nights . <p> " If people do n't know what they 're going through they can be unintentionally insensitive , but not with malice , it 's often because they 're unaware their friend or colleague is under immense stress and characterise it as out of the norm if they 're withdrawn or emotional . " <p> The good news is that close friendships should prevail long term , according to Ms Hall . <p> " If it 's a solid close friendship , it may go through a bit of a blitz but it should come back together because of its solid history , " she said . <p> Ms Hall said tactics could be adopted to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the key things is to have a rule in place to limit fertility talk to 20 minutes a day , " she said . <p> " Have the talk in the garage or laundry so it 's not in your commonly used space and get it all off your chest in those 20 minutes -- -- with exceptions when important discussions need to be had -- then have the rest of your life together . <p> " It 's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast amount of information out there but I recommend people get back to basics and keep communication channels open . <p> " It 's important to understand where each other is at because it 's an incredibly stressful journey for both but traditionally more so for women because they 're going through injections . " <p> Couples trying IVF may withdraw from their social circls because they do n't want to go to another baby shower or face the family at **25;127;TOOLONG <p> IVF is a common form of assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) , and typically involves five steps to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg retrieval from ovaries ; fertilisation of eggs ; embryo maturation and transfer of embryo to uterus . <p> Each cycle takes about six weeks to complete , with many women undergoing multiple cycles when initial attempts are unsuccessful . <p> The latest Australian and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database ( ANZARD ) report shows a total of 70,082 cycles of Assisted Reproductive Technology treatment were performed across Australia and New Zealand in 2012 . <p> More than 92 per cent of those cycles were carried out in Australian clinics . <p> Earlwood residents Rebecca , 37 and Peter Tos experienced unexplained infertility and at least seven failed cycles of IVF cycles over as many years until finally delivering a healthy baby girl , Mahli Rose six weeks ago . <p> But undergoing IVF was n't an easy road for them to travel . <p> " We were really open about what we were doing with bosses , work people in the early years , " Ms Tos said . <p> " But when we saw the disappointment in their faces when it did n't work , we 'd go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work , we did n't tell anyone . <p> " A lot of people tried to be comforting that had no idea what we were going through and why would they when they have n't been through it themselves ? " <p> Ms Tos said the experience brought her closer to her husband but that some of her friendships deteriorated . <p> " My friends were more conscious about sharing how wonderful motherhood was with me , " she said . <p> " They held back and did n't share as much with me and looked to others for that . <p> " Certain friendships changed where we could n't connect on some levels because I was n't a mother and they were n't aware of the pain I was going through . <p> " It was hard because I was doing IVF over seven years when most friends who were similar ages to me were onto their third babies . " <p> But Ms Tos said the ordeal paled into insignificance with the birth of her daughter and that she has n't ruled out doing it again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't lnow if it 's possible to conceive naturally but I would like to give her a brother or sister one day .
