<p> The Adelaide Botanic Garden has decided to open its conservatory until midnight on the first day its rare corpse flower opens . <p> But do not go rushing for the door just yet , while gardens staff say while they can smell something like a dead possum in the conservatory , they will not know until later on Sunday if the flower is about to open . <p> Horticultural curator Matt Coulter told 891 ABC there were a few signs suggesting the Amorphophallus titanum was about to flower but staff would know for certain between 1:00pm and 2:00pm . <p> " It is very specific on when the flower opens and it opens around that time , " he said . <p> " Say by 2:00pm if it has n't it started to open it wo n't be today . <p> " One of the staff members told me this morning that they could actually start to smell something which is a sure sign that it is going to open . So fingers crossed it is going to be today but if not today it will definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower looked and smelt its strongest on the first day and would wither by the second afternoon . <p> He described the plant as fascinating and said most of its growth had occurred in the past eight weeks . <p> " It 's quite an interesting smell , " Mr Coulter said . <p> " It 's not just one smell that stagnates . What the plant does is pulses the smell out , so every 10 or 20 seconds it actually pushes a smell out in a pulse ... it has a strong ammonia , rotting sort of fish sort of smell . " <p> The gardens will provide the public an update on its Facebook page when the flower opens .
