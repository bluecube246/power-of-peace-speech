the adelaide botanic garden has decided to open its conservatory until midnight on the first day its rare corpse flower opens .  but do not go rushing for the door just yet , while gardens staff say while they can smell something like a dead possum in the conservatory , they will not know until later on sunday if the flower is about to open .  horticultural curator matt coulter told 891 abc there were a few signs suggesting the amorphophallus titanum was about to flower but staff would know for certain between 1:00pm and 2:00pm .  " it is very specific on when the flower opens and it opens around that time , " he said .  " say by 2:00pm if it has n't it started to open it wo n't be today .  " one of the staff members told me this morning that they could actually start to smell something which is a sure sign that it is going to open . so fingers crossed it is going to be today but if not today it will definitely flower looked and smelt its strongest on the first day and would wither by the second afternoon .  he described the plant as fascinating and said most of its growth had occurred in the past eight weeks .  " it 's quite an interesting smell , " mr coulter said .  " it 's not just one smell that stagnates . what the plant does is pulses the smell out , so every 10 or 20 seconds it actually pushes a smell out in a pulse ... it has a strong ammonia , rotting sort of fish sort of smell . "  the gardens will provide the public an update on its facebook page when the flower opens .
