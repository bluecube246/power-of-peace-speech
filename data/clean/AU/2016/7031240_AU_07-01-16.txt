Certain people have pride issues , but it 's stuff you overcome in time .

' <p> " My argument was : People are more intelligent than that . They want to hear what 's real , so why do n't we write some stuff that we 're actually going through ? " <p> And Bradford-born Zayn claims he decided against picking up a copy of 1D 's recent album Made In The A.M. -- their first record without him -- after being unimpressed by their second single Perfect . <p> In an article in the latest issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they write : " Malik admits he has n't even heard it .

' " <p> New friends : Zayn Malik with Kanye West and Joe Jonas.Source:Supplied <p> However , he insists there 's no longer any rivalry between him and his former band mates and there wo n't be any competition if any of the band members -- who are currently on a hiatus -- release solo records at the same time as his . <p> He added : " There are no sides to pick . We 're not going head-to-head .

" <p> And speaking about women , he admitted he goes for ladies who are " a bit chunky " and with whom he can talk about politics . <p> He tells Billboard : " I need a challenge . Also , I like girls that are a bit chunky in certain areas -- the nice areas . I like a fuller woman . <p> " I enjoy an intellectual conversation as well , where someone can construct a sentence beyond what hair and makeup they 're wearing , and talk about something political or about the world . I like an opinion . "
