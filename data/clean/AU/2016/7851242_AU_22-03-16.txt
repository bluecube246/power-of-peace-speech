SEGA's Strategy Humble Bundle Is Bloody Good Value

SEGA 's Strategy Humble Bundle Is Bloody Good Value  I was having a chat with a friend about strategy games . He told me he was going through some older titles , but could n't really get into the Total War games . Having just finished a playthrough of the original Dawn of War 2 , I recommended Relic 's classic and said it should be available for pretty cheap .  He had n't found the time to buy the game yet , though . So when I saw SEGA dump a truckload of strategy games into the latest Humble Bundle package this morning , you can bet my friend got a prompt email .  Besides the wet squib that is the Humble Monthly offering , there 's a ton of value in here . The first Dawn of War is still most people 's favourite because it has all of the base-building mechanics that Relic opted to scrap for the sequel .  The original Company of Heroes remains an excellent experience for those with a penchant for WW2 strategy . The Total sorely needed quality-of-life changes . But they 'll run like the wind on modern systems and with mods there 's plenty of fun to be had .  Second Tier : Pay more than the average ( US$6.10 )  Two quality collections and one hell of a PC port .  Valkyria Chronicles  Warhammer 40,000 : Dawn of War 2 -- Grand Master Collection  Eastside Hockey Manager  Total War : SHOGUN 2 -- Fall of the Samurai Collection  66% off Football Manager 2016  The Football Manager 2016 coupon is kind of a moot point I feel : if you 're into Football Manager , chances are you would have bought the game already ( or you 're still playing an older version ) . Eastside Hockey Manager is Sports Interactive 's take on ice hockey management and is still pretty fresh , having only launched in early December .  But the real value here is in the mega collections . The Dawn of War 2 comes with the original , the Chaos Rising expansion and Retribution , which is basically three strong campaigns that also lets you play a campaign with any of the six available races , a nice change from the Space Marine-bromance in DOW 2 and Chaos Rising .  For just over $8 , that 's worth it alone . But getting Valkyria Chronicles on top is a massive bonus . The PC port is the best version of what was originally a PS3 exclusive , running at a silky smooth 60 fps in 1080p .  If you 're unfamiliar with the IP , Valkyria Chronicles is a cross between a third-person action and tactical strategy that borrows heavily from the Second World War in its fictional depiction of a European conflict . It 's a great game for anyone who liked XCOM and a real PS3 gem . ( Can we get PC ports for the others , like Wipeout HD ? Please , Sony ? )  As for SHOGUN 2 , it 's one of the more beloved games in the Total War franchise although the nature of battling in Feudal Japan means the playable surroundings are a little more restricted than , say , Rome 2 unlock  This tier 's harder to justify , and might not be worth it at all if you 're not a stringent WW2/fantasy strategist .  Total War : ATTILA  Company of Heroes 2 : Master Collection  On the surface , it 's an excellent deal for Total War : ATTILA . But the game was not warmly received by fans , with the DLC pilloried for being excessive . Slavic nations cost US$6 . You want Charlemagne ? That 's another US$10 . And that 's not to mention the beefy rig users report you 'll need , as a result of the optimisation issues .  Company of Heroes 2 has no such issues with performance or optimisation though . The Master Collection also means you 'll get the two campaigns and three extra multiplayer factions . But the general consensus is that you can have a thoroughly rewarding experience with the original Company of Heroes and the Eastern Front mod .  It 's been years since I played the original CoH 2 singleplayer campaign , and I have n't had any experience with the it 's not as authentic as the original , although it 's hard to tell how much nostalgia plays a part in those impressions .  So that 's it for the latest Humble Bundle that 's actually worth your time . And money . A lot of your time and not much money . What are your thoughts ? Do the Total War/Creative Assembly games take your fancy , or are you like me and more partial to the Dawn of War offerings ? And what about Valkyria Chronicles -- any fans want to make an argument as to why people should play it in the comments ?  Discuss  The problem with a bundle full so many great strategy games is that rather than feasting on one for many hours ( like it deserves ) , you 'll most likely snack on them all for only a couple of hours each . Time for lunch .  Most of these were part of an older SEGA Humble Bundle which means unfortunately a lot of people will already own most of them . Its a shame , but it , and the rest can be considered a bonus .  Trending Stories Right Now  Matchmaking in Counter-Strike is often an exercise in tolerance . It 's even more intense in third-party matchmaking services , as those are generally only frequented by those truly devoted to the game . Naturally , that devotion often manifests in the form of teammates belittling each other , rage wars over the mic , and a general refusal to behave like decent human beings . ESEA runs one such service , although they 're not responsible for their users getting cranky . But they 've just given top players US$20,000 reasons to get even angrier at their teammates.
