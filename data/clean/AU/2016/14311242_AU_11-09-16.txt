<p> The Building Commission 's interim report will address both claims . It is understood the commission was satisfied with John Holland 's handling of the situation . It is also understood the commission 's separate inquiry into 13 other WA projects which imported through Yuanda has not yet found asbestos . <p> Other building materials on these projects , including the new stadium and Crown hotel , are being checked for compliance with Australian standards . There are no instances of non-compliance yet . <p> Building Commissioner Peter Gow said the investigation so far had found no cause for concern that asbestos was in other products supplied by Yuanda that were in WA buildings .
