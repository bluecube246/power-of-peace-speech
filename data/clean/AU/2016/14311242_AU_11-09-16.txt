the building commission 's interim report will address both claims . it is understood the commission was satisfied with john holland 's handling of the situation . it is also understood the commission 's separate inquiry into 13 other wa projects which imported through yuanda has not yet found asbestos .  other building materials on these projects , including the new stadium and crown hotel , are being checked for compliance with australian standards . there are no instances of non-compliance yet .  building commissioner peter gow said the investigation so far had found no cause for concern that asbestos was in other products supplied by yuanda that were in wa buildings .
