the weirdness followed after browne asked the referee to stop the contest after appearing to dislocate a finger . werdum landed another shot before the referee obliged and allowed browne to realign the joint , which ufc vice president of regulatory affairs marc ratner confirmed was against the rules during the broadcast . " there 's no time-outs in fighting , so no , he ca n't do that , " ratner said .  werdum won via unanimous decision ( 29-28 , 29-27 , 30-27 ) and then proceeded to taunt the crowd with a fake-crying gesture which led to edmond tarverdyan -- who coaches browne and his partner ronda rousey -- shouting " shut the f*** up " .  werdum retaliated to the call with a hefty kick to tarverdyan 's chest which almost unleashed another round chaos in the octagon .  the crowd erupted after the bizarre encounter which had security staff scrambling to diffuse the ugly situation .  " he came first , " werdum said . " he said a lot of bad things , you know ? my said ok , but he started it .  " i do n't know . i never start . i never started saying a lot of things , but he started , i do n't stay quiet . the guy says something , i just say be quiet . i just respond . when he said something , i respond that 's it .  " i think he had too much confidence for this fight and he said a lot of things . i beat him again . i did my job . "  naturally , the mma world had a lot to say about the weirdest fight at ufc 203.
