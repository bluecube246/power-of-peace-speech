The weirdness followed after Browne asked the referee to stop the contest after appearing to dislocate a finger . Werdum landed another shot before the referee obliged and allowed Browne to realign the joint , which UFC vice president of regulatory affairs Marc Ratner confirmed was against the rules during the broadcast . " There 's no time-outs in fighting , so no , he ca n't do that , " Ratner said .  Werdum won via unanimous decision ( 29-28 , 29-27 , 30-27 ) and then proceeded to taunt the crowd with a fake-crying gesture which led to Edmond Tarverdyan -- who coaches Browne and his partner Ronda Rousey -- shouting " shut the f*** up " .  Werdum retaliated to the call with a hefty kick to Tarverdyan 's chest which almost unleashed another round chaos in the Octagon .  The crowd erupted after the bizarre encounter which had security staff scrambling to diffuse the ugly situation .  " He came first , " Werdum said . " He said a lot of bad things , you know ? My said OK , but he started it .  " I do n't know . I never start . I never started saying a lot of things , but he started , I do n't stay quiet . The guy says something , I just say be quiet . I just respond . When he said something , I respond that 's it .  " I think he had too much confidence for this fight and he said a lot of things . I beat him again . I did my job . "  Naturally , the MMA world had a lot to say about the weirdest fight at UFC 203.
