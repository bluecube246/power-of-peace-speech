Ahead of the November 26 governorship election in Ondo State , a coalition of Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) accredited observers , has warned that refusal to extend the just-concluded Continuous Voters Registration ( CVR ) exercise will plunge the state into crisis .  The leader of the team , Mr. Kalu Victor , in a statement made available to The Guardian yesterday in Akure observed that the state is already tensed up politically and INEC must forestall any situation that might spark off crisis .  Victor warned that " any attempt by INEC , persons or groups to compromise the exercise aimed at disenfranchising a section of the state from voting during the coming elections will rather worsen the already tensed political and security situation . "  He said his statement was in response to the outcry by thousands of eligible voters , who could not register during the five days announced by INEC for the CVR across the 18 LGAs of the state .  His words : " The exercise witnessed a large turnout of voters across the state that anxious voters in Ondo State can not be captured all within the stipulated five days of this exercise .  " The registration was marred by very slow and ineffective machines , especially on the first and second days of the exercise . The late commencement of the exercise daily across the state was yet another worrisome case affecting the registration " .  He also identified " an obvious concentration and deployment of machines in low populated areas with the very high populated areas suffering shortages of machines and manpower " .
