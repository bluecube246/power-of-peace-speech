Madrid , two of the biggest and most prestigious clubs in the world , already met last season in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Champions League .  In their first ICC clash , Bayern lost on penalties to AC Milan after a 3-3 draw with the Rossoneri before thrashing Inter 4-1 on Saturday . Zidane&amp;#39 ; s men lost 3-1 to PSG in their first ICC fixture , before a 3-2 win over Chelsea on Saturday .  This match marked the end of the pre-season competition for both teams .  After an entertaining opening 45 minutes with both teams looking to get forward whenever possible , Bayern have had more of the ball and came closer to scoring .  The first real opportunity of the second half felt to the Spanish side . Lucas Vasquez found space down the right and fizzes a cross to Alvaro Morata on the edge of the box , but the striker 's first-time strike went harmlessly wide .  Despite Bayern controlled most of the game it is Real who took the lead at 79 ' , the edge of the box .  The Bavarians pushed for an equalizer that would have taken the game to penalties , but Real held firm to secure a 1-0 win . But Bayern 's new coach Ancelotti will nevertheless be satisfied with a largely dominant display played at a good tempo . Previously colleagues at Juventus and Real , Ancelotti and Zidane will now be rivals as coaches of two of Europe 's elite teams . But Ancelotti , now installed as Pep Guardiola 's successor at Bayern , hopes his team will become the force in Europe in 2016-17 .  The Bundesliga champions will now return home to Germany , with just ten more days until they take on Borussia Dortmund in the Supercup .  As StarTimes signed an exclusive broadcasting contract with Bundesliga for five successive years , from 2015 to 2019 , African viewers will see FC Bayern Munich playing again from the August 26 , 2016 live on StarTimes Sports Channels .
