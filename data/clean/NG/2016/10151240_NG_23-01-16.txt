<h> Group demands reinstatement of NITDA DG , threatens unrest <p> A civil rights organisation , Centre for Leadership Network Initiative , has described as illegal , the suspension of the Director-General of the National Information Technology Development Agency Mr. Peter Jack . <p> The group also called on the Federal Government to rescind the decision which , it said , was " based on ethnic sentiment , misinformation and witch hunting " , to avoid civil unrest . <p> The Executive Director of CLNI , Mr. Nelson Ossaieze , at a press briefing on Saturday in Abuja , traced the suspension to the ambition of a cabal within NITDA that has vowed to drag the successive achievements of Jack to disrepute , through a set of spurious allegations that are untrue , biased , parochial and malicious and against the change agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari 's administration . <p> Critics within the agency had accused Jack of allegedly organising employment for which only relatives of the dissolved board members were interviewed and employed . <p> They had in a petition also claimed that while due process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with the connivance of the Federal Character Commission . <p> The petitioners had also alleged that the agency was busy issuing letters to people who were not interviewed for employment , adding that the agency contributed funds towards 2015 elections . <p> But CLNI said its independent investigations had found the allegations to be untrue , and unfounded .
