u-17 afcon : golden eaglets walk on slippery ground  nigeria 's chances of gracing the 2017 u-17 africa cup of nations became narrowed yesterday , when the golden eaglets managed a slim 1-0 win over visiting niger republic at the abuja national stadium .  the team , which had to rebuild after 26 selected players failed the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) test conducted by caf , wasted numerous scoring opportunities . they must either win or draw in niamey in a fortnight to guarantee their qualification for the tournament billed for madagascar .  alagbe oluwatob-iloba 's second half strike was decider of the game in which the eaglets created chances but failed to make it count .  niger held their own thanks to their more tactical discipline and paraded several decent players , but their attack lacked the bite to really trouble the home team .
