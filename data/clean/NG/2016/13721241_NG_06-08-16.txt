<h> U-17 AFCON : Golden Eaglets walk on slippery ground <p> Nigeria 's chances of gracing the 2017 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations became narrowed yesterday , when the Golden Eaglets managed a slim 1-0 win over visiting Niger Republic at the Abuja National Stadium . <p> The team , which had to rebuild after 26 selected players failed the Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) test conducted by CAF , wasted numerous scoring opportunities . They must either win or draw in Niamey in a fortnight to guarantee their qualification for the tournament billed for Madagascar . <p> Alagbe Oluwatob-iloba 's second half strike was decider of the game in which the Eaglets created chances but failed to make it count . <p> Niger held their own thanks to their more tactical discipline and paraded several decent players , but their attack lacked the bite to really trouble the home team .
