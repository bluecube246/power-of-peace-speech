<h> ' Edo ' ll continue to make progress under APC ' <p> In Benin , the capital of Edo State , the sights and sounds of the environment are clearly in favour of Godwin Obaseki . <p> At every strategic place are the billboards of the All Progressives Congress ( APC ) candidate , to the extent that people are wondering if he is the only in the race . But , that puzzle is solved by the realisation that a level playing field exists in the state and no party is denied the right of having billboards . <p> Investigations revealed that many are disposed to the candidacy of Obaseki , who is widely believed to be a better alternative to the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) candidate . <p> ' ' My brother , we will vote for APC in this town because we ca n't afford to go back to the years of the PDP . The PDP wasted our time under Lucky . Pastor is wasting his time . Are you not seeing how good the roads are ? This one alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a taxi driver , who identified himself as Imafidon Samuel , said . <p> His thinking is in tune with what so many others said in Benin to the amazement of the visiting team , who never envisaged that level of Obaseki 's popularity . <p> Some people believe that the image of Governor Adams Oshiohole is largely working for him . While that may be true , Obaseki did not come across as someone , who would walk in anyone 's shadow . <p> If he succeeds the incumbent , it may not be a bad thing if he takes the latter 's footsteps , given that in eight years , Oshiomhole made Edo model of good governance . In a state where the delivery of social services was believed never to have been prioritised by those , who governed before Oshiomhole , taking after him may not be a bad idea at all . <p> But , the man at the centre of the election , made it clear that he would optismise the template created by the incumbent in realising his vision for the state . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under him with every sense of clarity . <p> His connection with the issues driving the race , were indicative of his capabilities at accomplishing the great gubernatorial Task ahead . <p> In line with his tripartite agenda of progress , sound management and good governance , he said he was committed to creating prosperity for every Edo indigene and resident . <p> To achieve this , he aims at rebuilding the civil service into a world-class work environment powered by information and communication Technology , ICT . <p> Also , resources will be devoted to training and empowering public and civil servants with modern management tools . <p> Obaseki also intends to rework the incentive schemes currently applicable in the public services to encourage better outputs . <p> He said : ' ' We will streamline and reposition government institutions to more effectively and efficiently deliver the greater good in overall public interest . We will Use technology make government more efficient by deploying information and communication technology ( ICT ) in internal administration , procurement processing , revenue collection and improving collaboration between and among Ministries , Departments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to ensure that not only are salaries paid as at when due but we adjust our model from a minimum wage structure to a living wage structure where Civil Servants are not financially disadvantaged . " <p> " Prosperity for Edo State must also necessarily include a better future for our children and happy retirement for our pensioners . We will clear all outstanding pension owed and ensure that Civil Servants receive their full entitlement immediately after they retire . <p> ' ' We will restore Edo State as the number one state in sports in Nigeria , especially in football where we once held sway as a talent ground . <p> " Our government will develop schemes to encourage artistic output and to encourage the growth of a market for trade in art and craft in Edo State with channels for export and exchange with the wider world . <p> ' ' We will develop a sustainable tourism industry in Edo State where the socio-cultural fabric of our host communities will make optimal use of our environmental resources , maintaining essential ecological balances and conserving natural heritage and biodiversity. @ @
