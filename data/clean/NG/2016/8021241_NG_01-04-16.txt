Bale , Benzema and Ronaldo are all in line to play in Saturday 's showdown at Camp Nou , although Madrid have lost each of the three previous matches against Barca when they have been able to field the star triumvirate .  But Zidane has called on ' BBC ' to outshine ' MSN ' and help Madrid reverse the form book against their bitter rivals .  " Tomorrow is the day to change that and we will try , " said Zidane .  Ronaldo made headlines after missing a penalty in his side 's 4-0 drubbing of Sevilla in Madrid 's last outing before the international break , but after scoring for Portugal in midweek , Zidane insists the 31-year-old is heading into Saturday 's affair in good spirits .  " Sometimes you miss , it is part of football . It can happen from time to time . He answered everyone versus Belgium .  " He has come back well after the break and I am happy with him . "  Zidane 's first Clasico as a coach comes heated on-field confrontation from the duo 's playing days on either side of Spanish football 's most bitter divide garnering plenty of pre-match attention .  But when put on the spot about the incident in the build-up to their first meeting as managers , Zidane downplayed their previous spat as players in jovial fashion .  " What do you mean ? " Zidane joked . " Sometimes things happen on the pitch , what happened with Luis Enrique on the pitch is forgotten . "  1 .
