abuja -- leaders of nigeria labour congress , nlc , trade union congress of nigeria , tuc , and their civil society allies , yesterday said they were meeting with the federal government and the leadership of the national assembly , with a view to reversing the recent 45 percent hike electricity tariff .  labour leaders and their civil society allies in a statement , reiterated their earlier position that on no account should nigerians be made to pay for services not rendered by the private sector operators in the electricity industry on the platform of electricity distribution companies , discos and generation companies , gencos .  they argued that allowing the hike to stand was tantamount to forcing nigerians to pay for darkness since there had not been increase in power supply since the takeover of the generation and distribution assets of power holding company of nigeria , phcn , by private operators in november 2013 .  recall that on february 8 , organized labour and its civil society allies held a nationwide protest denouncing and rejecting the hike despite a subsisting court power supply .
