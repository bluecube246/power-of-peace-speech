<p> The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ( MASSOB ) believes that Nnamdi Kanu , the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra ( IPOB ) , can not renounce his group 's demand for an independent state of Biafra . <p> Reacting to reports that the federal government was working out an arrangement for Kanu 's release from prison if he renounced his Baifra agitation , MASSOB described the condition as " laughable and inconsequential . " <p> In a statement by its leader Uchenna Madu , MASSOB says they do n't see Nnamdi Kanu betraying his belief on Biafra . <p> The statement read : " MASSOB does not see Mazi Nnamdi Kanu as one who can betray his belief on Biafra , he is not a sell-out , his ideologies on Biafra may differ , he can never betray hundreds of Biafrans that died recently on the course of Biafra . <p> " Secondly , Biafra is not a religious faith that can be renounced or abandoned . Nobody can renounce Biafra , it is an identity , culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not personal or individualistic . <p> " There are thousands of Biafranistic persons more determined , consistent , dangerous , focused , and unshakeable than Nnamdi Kanu , Uchenna Madu and other leading figures in the Biafra struggle . " Biafra is also bigger than all the leading figures put together . <p> Advertisement <p> " It is childish on Federal government to expect Nnamdi Kanu to renounce Biafra , the fate of over fifty million people . <p> " MASSOB advises Buhari to save his battered Nigeria 's face from more diplomatic shame by allowing the court to grant Nnamdi Kanu and others bail . <p> " We shall continue to press for their release including the ultimate aim of Biafra actualization with non-violence . Nigeria will soon experience another dimension of non-violence struggle that will marvel it . Soon the world will celebrate the downfall of the most corrupt country . " <p> A progress report on the dialogue between the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta ( MEND ) and agents of the federal government , at the weekend , said an arrangement was being worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government if he renounced his Baifra agitation . <p> But Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu could not confirm MEND 's weekend claim . Shehu said the government had not received the report of the talks from those it authorised to discuss with MEND .
