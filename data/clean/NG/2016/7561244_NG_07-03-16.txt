it amazing the ooni is marrying a girl who has been married 3 times and has changed her names so many times to hide her identity .... i mean who changes names so frequently in naija this woman story no be here ooo best of luck to them  i have friends that changed names o ! they finish using one name , then move on to another . this one babe had been promiscuous and stealing from her parents since we were kids ( i now wonder what made such a little girl so sexual ) ... anyways by uni " arsito stage " , she had changed to her middle name ... now on facebook " lagos big girl stage " , she uses one random english name ... when asked she said it 's her new name from getting baptized at daystar .  apparently the ooni is unperturbed by all these derogatory comments all over the blogs about his wife to be . if god says yes , no man can say no . is he supposed to un-propose to her and then comments ? marriage sometimes has nothing to do with the chastity of a woman . its the new wife 's luck shining . many men go ahead anyway , once they truly love the woman .  wish them well , but wish ooni 's former wife much better in her life sojourn  the rsvps are the bride 's uncle , john obayuwana , chairman of polo luxury , and the ooni of ife 's sister , princess folasade fadairo . see name drop o and one of the evil sisters had to be mentioned too , eish .  message to the next wife : hml dear olori , i hope in your interest that u will born . first wife did not born , no side chic ever claimed pregnancy ; none we know about . na only babymama back in d days who had a girl ; i 'm not saying something is wrong with ooni o. naija men are blameless just do everything in your power to have a child and dance to the sisters ' tune , since ooni seems to have difficulties in managing tun tun better be ready to obey every single command of her mil and her sils . she should go into this marriage knowing fully well , she will have no say in the affairs of her home . she must give birth and be quick about it and she must not at any point resort to jazz because ooni 's jazz will eradicate her own . e kabo ! ! ! the first wife has truly gained her freedom .  upon all the tea on dis girl wedding is still holding . i admire her hustle sha , while loads of single girls are still searching for ' the one ' . this girl is finding her 's for the 3rd time . congratulations  why are you people commenting when you do n't understand yoruba culture . it is culture for a king to be polygamous . stop making this personal and get over yourself . culture is not going anywhere no matter how technology advances . my sister is not a king but it is culture for a king to be polygamous -- get over yourself . about african men strengthening ties with their penises ! lmao ... what will someone not read from this blog ?  anywhoozies ... ooni carry go ! you are the immortal yoruba demon ... we all know this babe was a side chick before he became the king right ? abeg lemme go and join the queue ... makoja mi olugbala okin she orin akunleko !  but the girl is already an expert in seeking help outside for impotent men according to sdk . so she will be able to help yeye cover his impotency . they are both match made in heaven . calculating , vain , users and no souls people .  maybe if you guys knew a little tradition , you will not be spewing such ignorances. anyway , because of the long history between ife and benin kingdom , all oonis of ife have to take a benin bride . in the past , the oba of benin sent a benin maiden to a newly appointed ooni in ife , the idea is the strengthen the ties and basically mix the 2 royal bloods. i of those everything just gelled kind of arrangements .  assuming all the things written about her are true , she trully deserves a happy ending ! ! i honestly do n't believe any female enjoy jumping from one man to another , a lot of them are just victims of their circumstances .  in the spirit of sisterhood , we should have some compassion and hope this is the happily ever after , she 's being searching for .  i for one will be routing for her and will hug her tighter on her joyous day ! ! ? ? ? ?
