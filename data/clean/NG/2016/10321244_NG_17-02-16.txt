<h> Fayose disagrees with APC over airport project <p> Ado-Ekiti -- Ekiti State Governor , Mr Ayodele Fayose , has said the capital projects embarked upon by his administration , including an airstrip are not only timely , but are meeting people 's needs , contrary to the claim by a former governor of the state , Otunba Niyi Adebayo . <p> *Ayo Fayose <p> Speaking through his Chief Press Secretary , Mr Iidowu Adelusi , in Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday , the governor said the claim by Adebayo in Abuja on Tuesday that the airstrip project was ill-timed was borne out of malice because Adebayo failed to utiilise the opportunity given him by the people of the state by executing projects he ( Adebayo ) could be remembered for . <p> " Ekiti people should thank God that the APC people left this State , if not , this state would have collapsed . <p> " I learned that they have resurrected and then met in Abuja . Let them gang up again , I will floor them come 2018 . <p> " I am their headache and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let them keep lying . <p> If they have anything incriminating against me , they would have published it . But they do n't have anything , that 's why they resorted to fabricating lies to assist them . " <p> The governor noted that all the states created at the same time with Ekiti 20 years ago have either built an airport or airstrip . <p> The governor said when he conceived the idea to dualise Ado township roads , this same opposition party , then known as the Alliance for Democracy ( AD ) , said the project was ill-timed and not well conceived , but the people of the state are now enjoying the amenities . <p> " Let us do a comparison between the former All Progressives Congress ( APC ) and the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) administrations in Ekiti State and point out which has enhanced or retarded the progress of the state . <p> " Niyi Adebayo and Kayode Fayemi administrations plunged the state into debt . Hardly can you identify any project done by the APC led government , yet the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with my administation , they are the APC members who Ekiti people stopped from further plundering the state by voting them out on June 21 , 2014 . <p> " Despite the huge debt we met , the state has progressed and we have embarked on numerous capital projects such as the Funmilayo Olayinka Women Centre , the extension of the dualisation of the Ado-Ikere Road , the construction of a modern and befitting Ojaba Market . We will soon embark on the flyover project in Fajuyi area of Ado-Ekiti . We have done roads in Petim area of Ado , De Head-Police headquarters , Erio township road , Afao Road , the dualisation of Awedele Road among others . <p> " We know that APC leaders are stunned and dazed that there is no way they can stop our wheel of progress . Let them continue to gather together and they will be scattered because the people of the state have rejected them , " he said . <p> Governor Fayose added that he and his party , the PDP , are not afr aid of the 2018 governorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him and the party . <p> Meantime , a chieftain of the APC , Mr. Olusegun Osinkolu , has said the reconciliation meeting held in Abuja on Tuesday , where all interested parties in Ekiti State chapter of the APC resolved to subsume their groups into APC and pay total loyalty to the party , signaled that the end will surely come for Governor Ayodele Fayose 's reign in Ekiti politics in 2018.
