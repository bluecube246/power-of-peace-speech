Alms begging syndicate resumes operations in Warri PHOTOS  There are indications that a syndicate which specializes in begging with persons with chronic and disgusting diseases have resumed operations in Warri and its environs , DAILY POST can exclusively report .  We gathered that members of the syndicate who are mainly from the eastern part of the country beg and make exorbitant amount of money from alms to the detriment of the sick persons in their custody without rendering accounts or use the proceeds for the treatments of the sick persons .  The syndicate parades sick persons with various diseases that are ordinarily not palatable for sights without being confronted by anyone because it appears they are ready for any showdown with anyone who dares to question their presence in Warri .  They tried to pounce on our Correspondent for establishing their photographs as one of them went in front of a sick man with overgrown testicles , unknown to her , the shots had already been established .  The alms begging syndicate returned to Warri months after they were allegedly chased out Non-Government Organization , NGO .  The beggars were seen along the popular Warri/Sapele road near Urhobo College by our reporter a month ago before they relocated to the Airport junction along the same road .  The Warri Area Commander of the Nigerian Police Force , ACP Muhammed Mu'Azu in a chat with our correspondent described the act by the syndicate as a criminal offence , noting that his command is doing everything possible to track , arrest and prosecute them for alleged exploitation of the sick as well as Deltans .  However , some residents who also spoke with DAILY POST wondered why the syndicate move about with sick persons and what the monies realized thus far has been used for .  They called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , EFFC as well as other relevant government agencies to arrest and prosecute the syndicate for committing " health hazards " against deltans.
