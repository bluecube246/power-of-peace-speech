" The Federal Government of Nigeria and President Muhammadu Buhari have expressed very clear commitment to finish the ongoing and abandoned projects . "  " We are focusing on completion of ongoing projects ; this is one of the many ongoing projects . Lagos-Ibadan expressway is one of them ; Kano-Maiduguri is one of them ; Ilorin-Jebba is one of them and the Second Niger Bridge is one of them . "  " All those projects now , the contractors are moving back to sites and work is beginning . Gradually over the next three years we would complete those who lost their jobs ; they would come back to work . You would see increased merchandising and supply of building materials .  " When this project is completed , it would open up these communities ; connect Nasarawa State and Benue ; farmers would benefit from the movement and transportation of their farm produce . I am optimistic that we would get this project completed in 2018 . "  YNaija is the internet newspaper for young Nigerians , focused on the issues and ideas that matter for an evolving generation .
