former coach of nigeria 's super eagles , christian chukwu has lamented the deplorable situation that leads some nigerian players to seek greener pastures in some obscure leagues around the world .  this situation has gone so bad that some players now go to play in far away countries such as finland , afghanistan and some other nations which are not too good compared to the standard of nigerian football league .  the reason for this migration of nigerian players , according to chukwu , is the poverty situation in the country .  to chukwu , a member of technical and development committee of nigeria football federation , nff , " this is a sad situation when you see our young players fighting their way to countries such as finland and afghanistan in a bid to play professional football .  " i ca n't blame them because of the situation back home . poverty is the factor that drives most of these players to obscure leagues . they are going there in the name of getting money .  " another factor is allowances . many players are being owed backlogs of salaries by the local clubs in nigeria .  " the most unfortunate thing is that when you consider the life span of these players , they do n't have much , at least 10 years . so the next thing they will think of is to go abroad to play at any league available .  " some of these obscure leagues can not be compared with nigerian league which is better than most of them in terms of standard , " chukwu said .  posted by pmnews on march 16 , 2016 , 12:04 pm . filed under football , sports . you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2.0 . you can skip to the end and leave a response . pinging is currently not allowed .
