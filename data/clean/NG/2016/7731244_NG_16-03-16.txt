<p> Former Coach of Nigeria 's Super Eagles , Christian Chukwu has lamented the deplorable situation that leads some Nigerian players to seek greener pastures in some obscure leagues around the world . <p> This situation has gone so bad that some players now go to play in far away countries such as Finland , Afghanistan and some other nations which are not too good compared to the standard of Nigerian football league . <p> The reason for this migration of Nigerian players , according to Chukwu , is the poverty situation in the country . <p> To Chukwu , a member of Technical and Development Committee of Nigeria Football Federation , NFF , " this is a sad situation when you see our young players fighting their way to countries such as Finland and Afghanistan in a bid to play professional football . <p> " I ca n't blame them because of the situation back home . Poverty is the factor that drives most of these players to obscure leagues . They are going there in the name of getting money . <p> " Another factor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowances . Many players are being owed backlogs of salaries by the local clubs in Nigeria . <p> " The most unfortunate thing is that when you consider the life span of these players , they do n't have much , at least 10 years . So the next thing they will think of is to go abroad to play at any league available . <p> " Some of these obscure leagues can not be compared with Nigerian league which is better than most of them in terms of standard , " Chukwu said . <p> Posted by pmnews on March 16 , 2016 , 12:04 pm .
