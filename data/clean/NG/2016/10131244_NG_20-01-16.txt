Toyin Saraki opens up in Emotional Interview about losing one of her Twins as a Stillbirth Listen  In a move to create awareness of the direct and indirect costs of stillbirths , Her Excellency Toyin Saraki , Founder-President of the leading maternal health NGO -- Wellbeing Foundation Africa spoke with the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) to call for improvements in health education and access to primary healthcare -- key elements to reducing stillbirths around the world .  According to Toyin Saraki , she tragically lost one of her twins due to failures in the Nigerian public health care system .  She stated , " I was fighting for one life and completely bewildered how to mourn the other life ... People did not know whether to congratulate or commiserate with me . Stillbirths often go unrecorded , let alone lead to counselling . This is why I started the Wellbeing Foundation Africa , which works to improve reproductive , maternal , newborn , child and adolescent health across the continent . "  It must have been a terrible experience , no smiles . It 's amazing to know that this was what channelled her foundation 's work to prevent deaths in pregnancy and childbirth . Keep going Mrs Saraki , I hope the training you are giving Nigeria 's midwives will reduce stillbirths and deaths , 300,000 stillbirths in Nigeria annually is a shocking statistic .  just saying -- I heard Mrs Saraki gave her former cottage clinic to the state government but the current governor 's wife Mrs Omolewa Ahmed killed it dead . No wonder that when Mrs Saraki was commissioning that big new maternity hospital at Eruku she brought her foreign friends to build and run it .
