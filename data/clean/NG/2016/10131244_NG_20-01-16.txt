toyin saraki opens up in emotional interview about losing one of her twins as a stillbirth listen  in a move to create awareness of the direct and indirect costs of stillbirths , her excellency toyin saraki , founder-president of the leading maternal health ngo -- wellbeing foundation africa spoke with the british broadcasting corporation ( bbc ) to call for improvements in health education and access to primary healthcare -- key elements to reducing stillbirths around the world .  according to toyin saraki , she tragically lost one of her twins due to failures in the nigerian public health care system .  she stated , " i was fighting for one life and completely bewildered how to mourn the other life ... people did not know whether to congratulate or commiserate with me . stillbirths often go unrecorded , let alone lead to counselling . this is why i started the wellbeing foundation africa , which works to improve reproductive , maternal , newborn , child and adolescent health across the continent . "  it must have been a terrible experience , no smiles . it 's amazing to know that this was what channelled her foundation 's work to prevent deaths in pregnancy and childbirth . keep going mrs saraki , i hope the training you are giving nigeria 's midwives will reduce stillbirths and deaths , 300,000 stillbirths in nigeria annually is a shocking statistic .  just saying -- i heard mrs saraki gave her former cottage clinic to the state government but the current governor 's wife mrs omolewa ahmed killed it dead . no wonder that when mrs saraki was commissioning that big new maternity hospital at eruku she brought her foreign friends to build and run it .
