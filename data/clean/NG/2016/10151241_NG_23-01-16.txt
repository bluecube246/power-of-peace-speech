" we can not continue to sustain nigeria on injustice . we want a nigeria that will be run on equity and fairness .  " if the president wants a nigeria where every citizen will have confidence and faith in the country , the conference report should be implemented , " he said .  umeh , who is apga 's senatorial candidate in the re-run election for anambra central district , described the confab report as " an important national document which must not be wished away . ' '  he said are two controversial issues that bind nigeria together that must not be removed .  " the far-reaching recommendations of the conference and its resolution on issues of true fiscal federalism and political restructuring should not be changed .  " we approved rotational presidency within the six geo-political zones ; this , as well as true fiscal federalism will achieve harmony and confidence on the part of nigerians , " umeh , a delegate to the conference said .  the senatorial candidate promised that if elected as senator , he would advocate for the implementation of the report .  he dismissed the allegation that he was contesting the senatorial seat to move motions in favour of biafra , saying that his desire to contest the election was to ensure equitable distribution of the nation 's resources .  " my mission is different from that of the other senatorial contestants and i am ready to pay any price for standing by my people , " he said .
