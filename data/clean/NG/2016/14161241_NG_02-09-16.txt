<h> My father busy seeking attention -- Oduah 's son <p> One of the son 's of Senator Stella Oduah , Tuoyo Etoromi Oduah , has taken a swipe at his father and husband to the ex-minister , Satchie Etoromi , saying he will rather be a bastard than be called his father 's son . <p> The young man released a statement on Friday , where he labelled his father as " attention seeker " while also denouncing him . <p> Tuoyo accused his father of resorting to seeking attention in the course of his brother 's death . <p> While reacting to the claims by his father , he said he was not told of the death of late Maxwell Etoromi by his family members . He said he called his father on the day of the incident to inform him . <p> Maxwell Chinedu Etoromi died a week ago after he took a wrong medication prescribed for him following a tooth surgery . <p> The 28-year-old , died at a Turkish private hospital in Abuja . <p> Tuoyo further noted that there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The statement reads , " I feel so heartbroken and distraught that during our time of mourning for my beloved brother , I have been reduced to issue a press statement against my biological father , Mr Satchie Etoromi . <p> " Life is serious . It is not a Nollywood movie . This is madness . This is evil . This is defamation . This is attention seeking . This is opportunism . This is shamelessness . This is jealousy . This is abnormal . This is bitterness . This is shocking ! <p> " Buwa and I were the product of a short and abusive marriage that ended almost 30 years ago . To a man with many other wives and children . Stella Oduah is the only father , mother , carer and provider that my brother has ever known . The Oduah family is the only Family that he has ever been part of and Akili Ozizo in Anambra state is the only hometown he has ever had . <p> " I called Mr Satchie and the Etoromi family to inform them immediately my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him or the representatives of the family throughout the funeral . I offered to build a relationship and have a new start . <p> " I was happy and optimistic . But i was wrong . Instead of asking about his dead son , he proceeded to use my brothers passing as an excuse to shamelessly insult my mother just like he is doing now , issue death threats and even ask for dowry from almost 30 years ago . <p> " This is madness . Mr Satchie Etoromi 's motivation is not love , not grief , not reconciliation , not to reach out but to seek attention , bitterness , revenge , jealousy , abusive tendencies , possessiveness and maybe even genuine madness . <p> " Mr Satchi Etoromi , I beg you with God to please leave us alone forever and let Buwa rest in peace . May God have mercy on your soul on for what you have just done . I wanted to forgive and reconcile but your recent actions and character have revealed that it is better to be a bastard than be your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time that I will acknowledge and respond . Any further public words and actions from Mr Satchie Etoromi will be addressed through legal means . " <p> A man does not become a father by impregnating a woman . Anyone can do that -- even a mad man can . He must contribute to the growth and wellbeing of the child with necessary support -- financially or with words of encouragement . You can not reap where you never sowed.Those of you abusing him , ABI UNA BIBLE DIFFERENT ? <p> Where are those idiot that were online here insulting igbos . That in ur tribe men are free to abandon women with children , it is abomination in sight of God.call igbos anything u like but we hardly abandon our kids . Most of idiot here will conclude anything they like as long as they know igbos are involve . God will continue frustrating haters of igbos.have u people heard from the son ? One things is human being ca n't be God and if God want to bless u , He will not make enquiries , had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to burn every igbo . He is a loving God that is why he keep blessing us . <p> Atleast what you have done now is to acknowlege and let the public including myself to understand that the man ( Satchie Etoromi ) who complained bitterly days ago is not a biological stranger to you , but an attitudinal one . Be it as it may , no man has the right to take the respect that should be accorded him traditionally when he is still alive . Except he has renounce you as a son or daughter or perhaps you only hear that he exist but you do nt know where he resides . The best you can do is to allow him play his role in his son 's burial after which you resume quarrel . <p> Hw can dis boy tell a story of about 30years , obviously being brainwashed by the mother bt anyway d man did n't run faster for those boys , in my own knowledge about marriage is either u settle with ur wife or u loose everything with her , peace be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must one day beg the father , it is his mother wealth that , is deceiving him . If the father decide to cos him now , he must surely pay for it . As from today he would be address as bastat <p> I found this very absurd to the african culture . be it igbo , yoruba , hausa , egun , fulani and even swahili . family ties and respect for elders are primary factors and it is obvious this family is a bad image to not just the southern Nigeria but the country entirely , an irresponsible father , a loveless systematic witty wife and uncultured child ...... I am looking forward to the extended families , communities and even state 's response to all these cause I know these institutions like many other valueless Nigerian institutions will start giving their sentimental views . God save Nigeria . <p> boymama how do you know your mother were abused over 30 years ago ? i guess you were not even born then .... hmmmm ask your mama what really happened ..

Mind u all that she left her first marriage and contracted a second one . She eventually left the second marriage . The two husbands are not Igbo . Knowing her traits , Stella knows very well no Igbo man will contemplate marrying her . She may have absconded with the children when the going got sour . And what would u expect than brainwashing . I can tell u here that the husband may have made attempts to reach his children but must have met a brickwall . Needless to ask u people whether u know the antecedent of Stella . Can such a woman stay loyally under any man ? And lastly please do n't drag this into tribal issue . No Igbo will endorse a son denigrating his father whether biological or otherwise with such harsh words . It is condemnable . Who is sure the son actually wrote that diatribe against his father . For the father asking for the son 's corpse actually shows he is concerned about his children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , Stella .

Thank u all . <p> I would rather advice this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , arrange a meeting between your mother and father before some responsible elders and kins men of your kindred . You can even invite some respected clergy men . Thrash the matter face to face , rather than this public forum . Its not proper .
