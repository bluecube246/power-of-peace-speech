*Govt to observe low-key 20th anniversary  Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose has affirmed his readiness to demolish more houses in Ado Ekiti , the state capital , to pave the way for the flyover project .  Speaking yesterday evening during this month 's edition of his media chat , " Meet Your Governor " , aired on the major electronic media in the state , Fayose said the demolition would begin on Monday .  Fayose said the demolition of houses on the flyover route was to build road beside the bridge to ease mobility and traffic .  He apologised to residents , motorists , pedestrians and commuters coming in and out of Ado Ekiti for inconveniences experienced during construction of the flyover .  Houses were demolished on May 16 , 2005 , during Fayose 's first administration to allow for dualisation of the road from Okesa to Ijigbo area of Ado Ekiti .  Fayose explained : " From next Monday , houses will be demolished for the road construction to complement the flyover . We are also going to demolish buildings that there will be a low-key celebration for the 20th anniversary of the creation of Ekiti State on October 1 and the second anniversary of his administration on October 16 .  He said : " We will have a low-key celebration ; if it is only prayer we will organise to mark the day , we are going to do it because of the economic situation of the state . We must live within the ambit of our resources . "  The governor vowed not to relent in changing the face of Ado Ekiti , saying the decision to take traders using wheelbarrow to market their ware off the streets was to ensure sanity .
