The immediate reward for the 1996 champions is a potentially -- explosive semi final clash with Germany , conquerors of Portugal , at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo on Wednesday .  It was never going to be an easy stroll and Coach Samson Siasia 's wards took the game by the scruff from the beginning , with Imoh Ezekiel 's lively run down the right in the first minute ending with a feeble shot by midfielder Usman Mohammed . Denmark 's Casper Nielsen came close to embarrassing goalkeeper Emmanuel Daniel in the 12th minute , but his volley sailed over .  From then on , it was Nigeria , and it was in no way against the run of play when Mikel Obi swept home with his left on the quarter hour after another brilliant run by Ezekiel . The Belgium -- based forward was causing the Danes plenty of problems and came close to scoring three minutes later , before two excellent reaction saves by Daniel preserved Nigeria 's lead . Seven minutes before recess , defender Stanley Amuzie could have doubled Nigeria  Another brilliant Daniel save in the 45th minute ensured Nigeria went into the break still ahead .  In the 56th minute , Daniel had to come up with another huge save , as everyone else missed from a teasing free -- kick . Three minutes later , Nigeria doubled their lead , Aminu Umar heading into the net from a Mikel Obi corner .  In the 62nd minute , it would have been 3-0 , but an angled header by Imoh Ezekiel from another Mikel Obi corner missed narrowly .  The Nigerians kept up the pressure and duly won the day to set up a semi finals with the Germans , but assistant captain Azubuike Okechukwu will miss that game after bagging his second yellow card of the tournament with 10 minutes left on the clock .
