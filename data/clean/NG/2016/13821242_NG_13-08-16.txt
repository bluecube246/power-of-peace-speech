the immediate reward for the 1996 champions is a potentially -- explosive semi final clash with germany , conquerors of portugal , at the arena corinthians in sao paulo on wednesday .  it was never going to be an easy stroll and coach samson siasia 's wards took the game by the scruff from the beginning , with imoh ezekiel 's lively run down the right in the first minute ending with a feeble shot by midfielder usman mohammed . denmark 's casper nielsen came close to embarrassing goalkeeper emmanuel daniel in the 12th minute , but his volley sailed over .  from then on , it was nigeria , and it was in no way against the run of play when mikel obi swept home with his left on the quarter hour after another brilliant run by ezekiel . the belgium -- based forward was causing the danes plenty of problems and came close to scoring three minutes later , before two excellent reaction saves by daniel preserved nigeria 's lead . seven minutes before recess , defender stanley amuzie could have doubled nigeria  another brilliant daniel save in the 45th minute ensured nigeria went into the break still ahead .  in the 56th minute , daniel had to come up with another huge save , as everyone else missed from a teasing free -- kick . three minutes later , nigeria doubled their lead , aminu umar heading into the net from a mikel obi corner .  in the 62nd minute , it would have been 3-0 , but an angled header by imoh ezekiel from another mikel obi corner missed narrowly .  the nigerians kept up the pressure and duly won the day to set up a semi finals with the germans , but assistant captain azubuike okechukwu will miss that game after bagging his second yellow card of the tournament with 10 minutes left on the clock .
