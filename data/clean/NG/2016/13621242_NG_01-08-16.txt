museveni 's long-time rival features in guinness world book of records , all thanks to him  uganda 's opposition leader , kizza besigye , has been given a spot in the latest edition of the guinness book of records . the guinness book of records , described on wikipedia as a reference book " listing listing world records and national records , both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world , " has announced mr. besigye as the most imprisoned person in one year . he holds this record as the result of being jailed not less than 15 times in the past one year .  besigye is not a bank robber though . his only crime seems to be having the audacity to contest against yoweri museveni , uganda 's leader for the past 30 years . besigye , who was museveni 's personal physician for many years has been jailed and then released by museveni many times before the ugandan presidential elections were held in february . museveni won by a landslide , amidst protests of widespread rigging , effectively n't stop after the elections as he was arrested again soon after and placed in jail . he is currently on trial for treason ( allegedly disobeying police orders during his presidential campaign ) , being shunted back and forth from jail to his trial like a common criminal . besigye , who could have easily made guinness book of record during his presidential campaign , is now a prisoner of democracy .  besigye once sat on a sofa placed on a car in one of his campaigns . guinness book of world records worthy . inset is the man who gave him the sofa . credit : www.monitor.co.ug  the jury is still out though on what yoweri museveni runs in uganda as it definitely can not be labelled a democracy . museveni left the ideals of democracy long ago , principles he promised the people of uganda 30 years ago when he first became president . he has been involved in deposing two presidents , including the infamous idi amin , defeating kizza besigye four times at the elections and is is currently on his fifth term in arrive , museveni will be 75 and too old to contest as president of uganda like its constitution says . however , he has likened his country to a banana plantation once , saying " how can i go out of a banana plantation i have planted that has started bearing fruits ? "  for a man that was once described as a beacon for democracy in africa , museveni 's arbitrary arrests of opposition members has surely made him an african " big man " ( dictator , in other words ) , like they say in african political circles . his position in the " big men " of africa cult , which include people like mugabe , teodoro obiang , eduardo dos santos and idris deby , is unquestionable . time will tell whether or not the inference of besigye 's guinness book of records appearance will spark a revolution in uganda .
