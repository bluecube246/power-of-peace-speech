manchester city survive scare to claim three points  manchester city officially began their campaign under their new manager , pep guardiola today . the match was equally important for pep as it was for the citizens because for many , it was an indication of whether guardiola would survive in the madhouse that is the premier league .  never mind that these things are hardly ever decided at the start of the season , football fans were out in their judgmental best . the talking point began way before kickoff , with reports that joe hart would not start as a result of a fallout with guardiola . their opponents on saturday evening were sunderland and many predicted a whitewash at worst .  in the end , nolito and stones got their debuts and manchester city got down to business in professional fashion . sterling was brought down in the 4th minute of play and sergio aguero coolly stepped up to slot home the resulting penalty- you have a sense he will score a lot of goals this season .  from then it high pressing and hogging possession but the city defence looked as fragile as ever . with kolarov playing in center back alongside stones , in one of pep 's many weird formations , the team looked shaky .  sunderland hardly ever probed and when they eventually did , city 's defence was easily parted as jermaine defoe put the ball past caballero to draw matters level .  city continued to probe and iheneacho was brought into the fray alongside jesus navas . eventually , city needed an own goal from a navas cross to take the lead in the 83rd minute and put the game to bed .  not the most convincing performance but the three points are in the bag !
