Manchester City Survive Scare To Claim Three Points  Manchester City officially began their campaign under their new manager , Pep Guardiola today . The match was equally important for Pep as it was for the Citizens because for many , it was an indication of whether Guardiola would survive in the madhouse that is the Premier League .  Never mind that these things are hardly ever decided at the start of the season , football fans were out in their judgmental best . The talking point began way before kickoff , with reports that Joe Hart would not start as a result of a fallout with Guardiola . Their opponents on Saturday evening were Sunderland and many predicted a whitewash at worst .  In the end , Nolito and Stones got their debuts and Manchester City got down to business in professional fashion . Sterling was brought down in the 4th minute of play and Sergio Aguero coolly stepped up to slot home the resulting penalty- you have a sense he will score a lot of goals this season .  From then it high pressing and hogging possession but the City defence looked as fragile as ever . With Kolarov playing in Center back alongside Stones , in one of Pep 's many weird formations , the team looked shaky .  Sunderland hardly ever probed and when they eventually did , City 's defence was easily parted as Jermaine Defoe put the ball past Caballero to draw matters level .  City continued to probe and Iheneacho was brought into the fray alongside Jesus Navas . Eventually , City needed an own goal from a Navas cross to take the lead in the 83rd minute and put the game to bed .  Not the most convincing performance but the three points are in the bag !
