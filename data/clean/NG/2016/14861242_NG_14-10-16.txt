<p> N'Golo Kante has always had a plan for his career and will join " a very , very big European club " if he leaves Chelsea , his former coach at Caen has said . <p> Chelsea paid around ? 30 million to sign Kante from Premier League champions Leicester City in the summer , capitalising on a release clause included in the Frenchman 's contract when he moved to the King Power Stadium from Caen for ? 5.6m just 12 months earlier . <p> Kante will face Leicester for the first time since the move at Stamford Bridge on Saturday , adding another chapter to a remarkable story that has seen him rise from the French third division to one of European football 's biggest clubs in just three years . <p> And Patrice Garande , the Caen manager who signed Kante from National side Boulogne in 2013 , believes his former player could scale even greater heights . <p> " I think from the moment N'Golo came to us in Ligue 2 he had a career plan but without trying to go too quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , and that is why he did two seasons with us , and then left . It 's he who decides . <p> " I thought Leicester City was a good choice and one that suited him , because in his mind going to England in a club like that was a step towards going even higher . He has had a rapid rise , but it has been progressive . <p> " He was in Ligue 2 , then Ligue 1 . He goes to England with Leicester , they win the Premier League . Then he goes to Chelsea , and after that he 'll go to a very , very big European club , that 's for sure . <p> Advertisement <p> " When he wanted to leave Leicester , there were a lot of clubs who wanted him , and it was he who decided to go to Chelsea . He 's not someone on whom you can impose a decision ... you ca n't really influence him . He listens , but it 's always him who makes the decisions . " <p> Garande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad in time for Euro 2016 and impressed as Didier Deschamps ' men reached the final on home turf -- turned down an approach to represent Mali at international level during his two-year spell at Caen . <p> " I had talked to him at that time , because he had n't chosen to play for France , " Garande said . " He could also have played for Mali . They wanted him to , he did n't . I often talked to him about the French national team , telling him : ' There is n't a player like you , with your profile in midfield ' . <p> " I always thought he would be an international . He has an incredible ability . He came into Ligue 2 , he observed , and got up to that level . He came into Ligue 1 , he observed , and he got up to that level , and was very good . When he went to England , at first he played 20 minutes , then a half , then a bit more . After that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He played for France in a position that is n't his at Euro 2016 , in front of the back four , and he was brilliant . He has incredible potential and he 's also a very intelligent boy who has his feet on the ground , who takes things step-by-step . He analyses everything that goes on around him .
