The Flying Antelopes romped to the top of the NPFL table after a 4-0 home win over their nearest challengers for the title with Tope Olusesi , Godwin Aguda , Christian Madu and Obinna Nwobodo supplying the goals that buried the Pride of Rivers .  Speaking with SportingLife in a brief chat , the skipper of the Enugu side , Okey Odita revealed that they wanted to tell the governor through the game that with adequate motivation and support , Rangers can post even better results than that for the remainder of the league season .
