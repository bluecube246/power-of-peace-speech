<p> Sporting boss Jorge Jesus has insisted no opponent will play in the Bernabeu like his brave side did in Wednesday 's Champions League Group F opening loss . <p> Late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Alvaro Morata overcame a 47th-minute strike from Bruno Cesar to give the home side a dramatic last-gasp victory . <p> And the Portuguese manager expressed pride in his team 's performance after the match . <p> " We know what qualities we have no matter who we play and we showed tactical discipline . We were excellent until the 88th minute and the Madrid substitutes helped change the game . When new players came on we lost a bit , " Jesus said . <p> Sporting dominated Real for long stretches on Wednesday , and in that Jesus took special satisfaction despite the disappointing defeat in the end . <p> Advertisement <p> " I think we played a great game , but we need a bit more experience . The Ronaldo goal was great , he 's the best player in the world and that happens . It should n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side will play here in Madrid as well as we have done . They did n't have a single chance in the first half , but there 's a reason they 're European champions . <p> " They have that mentality and reputation and changed the game in two minutes . We lost in a game in which we played with great spirit . We did n't deserve to lose . <p> " It presents a lot to think about . If we 'd have won or drawn it would have been a different outlook but as we 've lost it 's different . <p> " We played a great game but we did n't get any points and the whole group stage of competition is that we have to get points .
