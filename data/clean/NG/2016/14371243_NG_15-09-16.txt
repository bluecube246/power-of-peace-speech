sporting boss jorge jesus has insisted no opponent will play in the bernabeu like his brave side did in wednesday 's champions league group f opening loss .  late goals from cristiano ronaldo and alvaro morata overcame a 47th-minute strike from bruno cesar to give the home side a dramatic last-gasp victory .  and the portuguese manager expressed pride in his team 's performance after the match .  " we know what qualities we have no matter who we play and we showed tactical discipline . we were excellent until the 88th minute and the madrid substitutes helped change the game . when new players came on we lost a bit , " jesus said .  sporting dominated real for long stretches on wednesday , and in that jesus took special satisfaction despite the disappointing defeat in the end .  advertisement  " i think we played a great game , but we need a bit more experience . the ronaldo goal was great , he 's the best player in the world and that happens . it should n't have been side will play here in madrid as well as we have done . they did n't have a single chance in the first half , but there 's a reason they 're european champions .  " they have that mentality and reputation and changed the game in two minutes . we lost in a game in which we played with great spirit . we did n't deserve to lose .  " it presents a lot to think about . if we 'd have won or drawn it would have been a different outlook but as we 've lost it 's different .  " we played a great game but we did n't get any points and the whole group stage of competition is that we have to get points . "
