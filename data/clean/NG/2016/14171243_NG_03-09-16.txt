Ubido rues Ikorodu Utd tie miss  Heartland defensive midfielder Julius Ubido is unhappy that he will be unavailable in the top-flight clash against newcomers Ikorodu United .  The Naze Millionaires will host the Oga Boys in Sunday 's Nigeria Professional Football League ( NPFL ) matchday 34 clash at the Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri .  The Owerri-based side were thoroughly beaten 1-3 by the Lagos outfit in the first fixture clash at the Agege Township Stadium in Lagos .  The former Lobi Stars utility players copped a knee injury in the oriental derby against champions and neighbours Enyimba .  Ubido said though he will be sorely missed in the clash but his teammates will certainly get the job well done to rake in the three points at stake .  " I did not play at Sunshine Stars in Akure . I was actually on the bench because I wanted the knee knock to heal completely . Maybe by the time the team are back from the away clash at El Kanemi Warriors I 'm sure to re-join the side for bad missing the NPFL matchday 34 clash against Ikorodu United in Owerri on Sunday , the team that ridiculed us in Lagos in the first fixture .  " I feel bad , too each time that I 'm not on the pitch actively doing what I like doing which is playing football .  " The team need me badly at this stage of the league , especially right now we are fighting for our dear lives in the on-going top-flight .  " My absence gives me personal concern but I believe my teammates know what is key in the match and other matches on the calendar .  " I strongly believe we will win the encounter against Ikorodu United though it 's expected to be tough , " said Ubido to supersport.com.
