<h> PDP Reform group raises the alarm over compromised ballot papers <p> The PDP Reform Group has raised the alarm over an alleged plan to introduce compromised ballot papers to rig the poll in favour of the APC . <p> Convener of the Group , Mr Ariyo-Dare Atoye , who raised the alarm yesterday in Abuja , alleged the complicity of the Edo State chapter of the APC and the INEC in what he described as the " despicable plot to subvert the will of the people through criminal manipulation of the ballot papers , which the electoral body plans to deploy for the election . " <p> According to Atoye , " We have just received credible information from the grapevine that the INEC has been fully compromised by the APC and the Edo State government in their desperate bid to rig the September 28 , 2016 , governorship election . <p> " Their modus operandi is to use special ballot papers that will make the spot of the PDP where voters are to thumbprint slippery and difficult to absorb ink , with the possibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes .
