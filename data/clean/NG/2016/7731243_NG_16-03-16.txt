Arsenal vs Barcelona : 3 Things To Watch For  Arsenal have never found the word impossible to be appealing . Here are three things to watch for as they seek to accomplish the impossible .  Even though most Barcelona fans do n't want to admit it , Arsenal hung with the Catalan giants for an hour at the Emirates . The only problem is that a football match is an hour and a half , and as such , Arsenal fell 2-0 . But the class was there to hang with them , not to mention it was in the midst of a bad run .  I still hold this bizarre faith that Arsenal is one positive performance away from clicking and making everything make sense . Whatever it needs to be triggered by feels like it is just within reach . That being said , to expect to find it here would be a fool 's endeavor . Although there is a small piece of me that wants to predict an Arsenal win , just in case . But I wo n't . Prediction : Arsenal 1-3 Barcelona  3 ) Who will score ?  Is this a recurring question that I am asking in every match preview ? Absolutely . Because until Arsenal answers it , it needs to continue to be asked . Arsenal simply do not have anyone that can consistently put in goals . I have vouched for Giroud to be on the brink of turning a corner for the past two months . It 's a good thing I did n't hold my breath .  Giroud is struggling , Alexis is out of ideas , Welbeck is an enigma and Ozil can not do it all on his own . So who is going to step up and put more than one goal past Barcelona ? Great question . That 's why I asked it .  David Ospina has actually done a swell job filling in for Petr Cech , but he is still most certainly not Petr Cech . However , Ospina is another of the wild card sort that , when he 's on top of his game , looks hard to beat . is going to be under heavy fire and if he starts to struggle , it could get incredibly ugly . But as mentioned , if he stays grounded , we could see something special .  1 ) Alexis ca n't be this bad .  Alexis is starting to come up in many people 's list of notable Arsenal busts . However , the Chilean still has that undeniable potential to be amazing . He just has to be a little inventive , which he has remarkably lost the ability to do . It still makes sense that if he were going to go that extra mile ( which , admittedly , he does try to do every match ) that it would be against Barcelona .
