angry judges endure tough governmental challenges  for some time to come , nigerians will remember the muhammadu buhari presidency for , among other things , its uneasy relationship with the judiciary . the times are unusual , and to remedy the damage done to the country by those who have exploited loopholes to destroy the country 's financial system , the government and its law enforcement and anti-graft agencies have felt impelled to enact and execute desperate remedies . in its response to these desperate remedies , the judiciary perches on the horns of a dilemma . they are aware of the popularity of the government 's desperate measures , but they are also sworn to dispense justice in accordance with the law , whether that law is weak or not , adequate or not . the government is not similarly discomfited . as this column noted many months back , its leading lights know how popular their measures are and have remained . more keenly , they also recognise that many provisions of the law , which they privately scorn , are unable to accommodate loot they have ferried away with freakish , cartoonish delight .  how the judiciary and the buhari presidency resolve this irritating dilemma will determine how successful the campaigns against financial malfeasance are , and what lasting impact they would leave on the future of nigeria in terms of social , financial and political stability . so far , if signals are not misread , there is little to indicate that the impact would be lasting or salutary . both arms of government would therefore need to find common grounds anchored on the constitution and the law to develop and fine-tune approaches that would have such salutary impact . if they do not find that common ground , the conflict between the two arms will continue , and probably fester to the point of damaging the polity and encouraging self-help , an attitude already evident in most parts of the country among various competing and conflicting ethnic and religious groups .  in july alone , three judges demonstrated how angry they were at the manner some government agencies were carrying out their constitutional responsibilities . case one involves an aide who was detained between july 1 and july 21 . arrested around june 27 by the efcc for his alleged role in laundering n1.2bn on behalf of the ekiti governor , according to reports , he was awarded five million naira as damages for wrongful and illegal detention . an angry justice olukayode adeniyi of the federal capital territory high court condemned what he described as efcc 's ' gross abuse of powers ' and ' arrogant display of executive might ' . the efcc in turn described the judgement as curious .  case two involves retired air commodore umar mohammed who was ordered remanded in prison custody by justice nnamdi dimgba of the federal capital territory high court . the retired air force officer , who was a member of the presidential committee on arms procurement , had been arraigned for money laundering and other charges . but instead of keeping him in prison custody , the department of state service ( dss ) , which arraigned him , kept him in their own custody for days presumably to complete some paper work . an incensed justice dimgba lashed a strong exception to this type of behaviour ; when the court orders that someone be kept in prison custody , the person ought to be kept in prison and not in the office . if the people at the dss want to become judge and do their job as well , i am ready to vacate my office for them , but as long as i am still here , i take an exception to them flouting the orders of the court . once processes have been filed in court , it is no longer in their hands , and the order of the court must be obeyed . " there was no punishment meted out to the dss operatives who flouted the order , not even a censure , nor a query , nor a slap on the wrist .  case three is strictly speaking not a part of the arms scandal trials . it was a regular corruption case which drew the ire of the trial judge , justice oluwatoyin ipaye of a lagos state high court , ikeja . she also had very harsh words for . " it appears that you are keen on taking the laws into your hands , " she told the efcc counsel . " why would you go before another court for this kind of order ( a forfeiture order ) when the matter is before me ? this kind of action is what is giving the judiciary a bad name . " the efcc had recklessly engaged in what the judge described as forum shopping to get an order it was unable to secure from her court .  another earlier case involving col nicholas ashinze , an aide of the former national security adviser ( nsa ) , col sambo dasuki ( retd ) , outraged a judge . this column drew attention to it last may . the colonel had been admitted to bail , but the efcc ignored the order and kept their quarry . furious , justice yusuf halilu , the trial judge , blurted out : " the efcc is a creation of the law . the court will not allow it to act as if it is above the law . it is remarkable nobody is above the law , yet they are acting as if they are above the law . the efcc act is not superior to the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria . the respondents in this matter have not behaved as if we are in a civilised society . they have behaved as if we are in a military dictatorship , where they arrest and release persons at will . the respondents , i must be bold to say the efcc and the army have behaved like illiterates . "  the anger of the judges is not surprising . they were not wrong to feel besieged by the government 's brusque manner of relating with a judiciary they had at various fora and in trenchant words described as equally corrupt as the suspects they were defending . if lasting and impactful progress in the anti-graft war is to be achieved , the government must find a better way to fight the war lawfully . after all , the executive arm has the leeway to propose a welter of reforms in the judiciary to expedite court processes , engender a manner as to sustain them above the proverbial suspicion of caesar 's wife . the government ca n't hope to put the cart before the horse and expect a miracle .  just as the legislature is not perfect and is in need of urgent reforms and cleansing , both the executive and the judiciary also share in the blame of poor justice delivery and destabilisation of the country 's economy and politics . rather than engage in blame game , the buhari presidency must be persuaded to recognise the limits of throwing caviar to the general as it has unwisely done so far . with the people on its side , sensibly or otherwise , and with the legislature fairly amenable to passing relevant laws to quicken the pace of justice delivery , the government should seize the opportunity to formulate policies and programmes that are capable of sustaining the effort to bequeath a better and cleaner judiciary to future generations . but should the government and its agents keep on seeing the struggle with the judiciary as a sanctimonious fight for the upper hand , they would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
