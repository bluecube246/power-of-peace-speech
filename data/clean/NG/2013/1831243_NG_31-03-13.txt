<p> The Court of Appeal sitting in Benin City , Edo State has declared the Umu Obi Obahai royal family of Ogwashi-Uku , Delta State as the only family qualified to produce Obi of Ogwashi-Uku . <p> The court , in a unanimous judgment also upheld the appointment of the father of the Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance , Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , Professor Chukuka Okonjo , as the authentic Obi of Ogwashi-Uku . It also upheld the decision of the High Court of Delta State , Ogwashi-Uku which sat on the same issue in 2007 . <p> The current Obi of Ogwashi-Uku , Okonjo , comes from the Umu Obi Obahai royal lineage of Ogwashi-Uku . In determining the appeal , the Court of Appeal upheld nine out of the 10 reliefs sought by the Umu Obi Obahai royal family , including the issue of which family can produce the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku . <p> The judgment endorsed the position of the Obahai family that succession to the throne of the Obi of Ugwashi Uku is hereditary by primogeniture and that the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also confirmed that Dieyi , the forefather of the Dieyi family which challenged the Obahai position was never an Obi but a mere regent , who held the throne in trust because Obahai 's children were minors at the time of his death . <p> Obi Obahai reigned from 1870 to 1882 and after his demise , the regency had prevailed until 22 years ago when the descendants of Obahai decided to take back their stool . To achieve this , they felt that the only weapon is not through a ' palace coup ' but to seek redress in the court of law . <p> The defendants in the case , on the other hand , contended that the Obiship had changed hands severally and , having been gazetted by the state government , the stool should remain with the Dieyi Family . This prompted the plaintiffs , especially the Okonjos , to go court . <p> A statement by the spokesperson of the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku , Law Okolobi , said Obi and the Obi-in-Council , were pleased that the truth in this matter had been confirmed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obi 's convinced that the judgement was a victory for the entire people of Ogwashi-Uku . " His Majesty , the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku , Professor Chukuka Okonjo and the Obi-in-Council , are very pleased that that the truth in this matter has been confirmed and justice has been done . <p> " It is the Obi 's conviction that the judgement is a victory for the entire people of Ogwashi-Uku , " the statement read . <p> Please leave your comment below .
