ten different types of men a woman should avoid in her twenties  i 'm always here to help you make less mistakes , you do love me for that yeah ?  here are the list of men you should literally speed away from in your twenties . why twenties ? because that 's the most sensitive decade in your life .  oya , let 's begin .  1 . the social media freak . if he claims to be grown up and spends a lot of time on instagram , twitter/facebook , speed !  2 . the flirty guy . if you constantly ask why he 's acting like he 's into every woman and if he calls every woman " honey " or " babe " or " sweetheart " or any other pet name when you should be together , speed !  3 . the loud guy . if he is so noisy that you sometimes even cringe when you are out together , then speed ! a man should n't be loud , he is a man not directioner &amp; whatever teenage music guy . scream all you want but when his music taste is limited to those listed above ? pls run . fast !  5 . the confused guy . the man who does n't seem to know what exactly what he wants in life ? you know the ones who ca n't give a definite response when you ask where he sees himself in five years ? yeah , that one . run from him .  6 . the bullet spraying guy . he ca n't speak a correct sentence in english yet he never stops talking and he never even listens when he 's corrected . scramble outta the door .  7 . the complex guy . he has a complex and then becomes defensive whenever you have a talk . he blows things out of proportion and makes you sometimes even feel bad for everything .  8 . the over spender . not like we are complaining about the man who spends a lot on us , i mean who does n't love good things ? but if he does does bad things or when he pisses you off . he does n't need to be around you .  9 . the one who is never happy for you . he does n't understand why that promotion is such a biggie and does n't get why you wo n't stop talking about it .  10 . the one who looks down on you . he does n't ever respect you . what the heck are you waiting for ?
