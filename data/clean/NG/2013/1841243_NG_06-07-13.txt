Jonathan place ministers under security watch as cabinet dissolution looms  The Presidency has placed members of the Federal Executive Council ( FEC ) under security watch in preparation for the dissolution of the cabinet . Consequently , President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife , Dame Patience , have started ignoring programmes obviously packaged by ministers to curry their favour . Saturday Newswatch gathered that anti-graft agencies have been given green light to take an intense look at the activities of the ministers . As a confirmation of the President 's new strategy , he did not only fail to attend the launch of a rebranding project packaged by the Minister of Tourism and Culture , Chief Edem Duke , held at the Presidential Villa on Thursday night , but also prevented his wife from adding colour to the occasion . The minister had placed a full page advertisement in some newspapers with photographs of the first family and himself while announcing the launch of what he called , " Fascinating Nigeria . " Several slots were also bought on radio and television to herald the unveiling to sources in the presidency , had to send his Vice , Namadi Sambo , to represent him at the last minute when he learnt that only two governors , Liyel Imoke of Akwa Ibom State and his Benue State counterpart , Gabriel Suswam with three other ministers were at the venue . " Three things could ordinarily have prevented Mr. President from attending ; one , the fact that he would want to be careful in dealing with the ministers now that some of them would be dropped ; two , he was told the attendance was extremely poor ; and three , some concerned civil servants had through some informal channels protested that rather than use civil servants , the minister contracted the re-branding to event managers , " a senior presidential aide who does not want his name in print confided in Saturday Newswatch .  It was gathered that the presidency might have also begun investigation into the appointment of one Mrs. Chika Balogun , one of the aides of the minister who signed the advertisement placed in the newspapers . Mrs. Balogun signed the advertisement as only allowed to appoint special assistants and personal assistants . Besides , it was gathered that civil servants were not carried along in the re-branding project which was a minus point on the launch . Civil service operations , according to sources close to the presidency , frown at chief executives who carry out projects without involving civil servants who are expected to continue such projects when such chief executives are no longer in office . " Mrs Balogun and Stephany Duarte that signed the advertisement are not staff of the ministry and the ministry is not actively involved . In fact , staff of the Ministry of Tourism and Culture are angry , " Ben Okocha , who claimed to be a staff of the ministry , told Saturday Newswatch yesterday .  Some Nigerians , however , condemned the rebranding exercise as a waste of public fund . But , the media aide to the minister , Dr. Taiwo Oladokun , said the rebranding project did not cost the ministry , and indeed the government , a kobo . This is not the first time the minister is using ' Conference in Calabar , he allegedly gave the project to an ex-beauty queen . This , some senior civil servants said , undermined the structure in the ministry . An aggrieved Abubakar Tanko , said : " As at now , we should be silent and see what we can do to build a good and united Nigeria ; if there is indeed a need for rebranding , definitely , it is not now . It is I'll-timed . "  But a legal luminary , Yusuf Olaolu Ali ( SAN ) : said : " Some of these challenges are a direct result of lack of direct foreign investment . What was being launched was with a view to attracting tourists into Nigeria . You will agree that in other parts of the world such as Egypt , Syria and South Africa , where there are challenges , they all still try to attract tourists because they feel that it is a good way of making money for their countries . " Everything about Nigeria is not gloom ; we have hope . So , I 'm not concerned will be used to do it , but since it 's a socio-economic programme , I think it is not out of place , " he added .
