<p> Consumers in these markets were seen complaining about what they considered as unjustified price hike of ram by dealers . <p> They lamented that they had thought the price would be more affordable almost a day to Sallah . <p> The smallest ram in these markets goes for N45,000 , as against N30,000 during the same period last year , while a big ram is sold for as much as N180,000 and N200,000 . <p> During our visit to these markets , sellers and buyers were seen haggling over the prices and unable to reach a compromise , while some who could afford them , paid and took the rams away . <p> A buyer at Mangoro cattle market , Akobi Gafar , said : " I thought I could get a ram at a reasonable price being a day to sallah but the prices are high ; that is why I have to haggle for a good price . <p> " Besides , it is not compulsory that every Muslim faithful must slaughter a ram , but only if you feel blessed and want to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Another buyer at Moshalasi , Raji Rasheed , told P.M.NEWS that he had visited many ram markets but could n't buy any because of the high cost , adding that the price of a ram this year is high . <p> " Many buyers can not buy and they go home disappointed . I am appealing to the government to look into the problem or else many Muslims will not be able to slaughter rams during this Eid-el-Kabir , " he said . <p> A buyer at Meiran , Poopola Kazeem lamented that he ought to have bought his own ram some months ago to beat the present high cost but was financially incapacitated due to some unforeseen circumstances . <p> The majority of the dealers who spoke with our correspondent , stated that the major routes traders used to bring rams to the state had become impassable due to the activities of Boko Haram . <p> Some of the dealers also blamed the exhorbitant price to insecurity , which has not allowed businessmen to bring rams from neighbouring countries like the Republic of Niger and Chad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaba Rago , in Ojo Local Government Area of the state . Roadside ram sellers in the area have crashed the prices of their rams , fearing that if they do not sell them between today and tomorrow morning , officials of the state government might capitalise on that and arrest them for selling by the roadside and on the road median . <p> Most of the ram traders who spoke with our correspondent complained of poor patronage , a situation which has equally forced a drop in the prices of rams in the area . <p> A ram that cost N60 , 000 last week , now sells for between N45,000 and N50,000 while those that were earlier sold for N45,000 attracted N35,000 . <p> The survey also indicated a drop in the price of small rams , from N20 , 000 , to N15,500 . <p> A ram dealer in the market , Yusuff Madaki , complained of poor sales . <p> Another dealer , Sanni Gambo lamented the high cost of rams from Niger Republic where they purchased them , adding that they have been recording poor sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning stranded at various bus stops as commuter bus drivers doubled transport fares ahead of the Sallah celebrations . <p> P.M.NEWS also noted that there were few vehicles at the bus stops with many of the drivers expressing frustrations . <p> Where the vehicles were available , the fare doubled by at least 150 percent . For instance , A trip from the old Toll Gate on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway to Agege area of the state that hitherto cost between N120 and N150 was increased to between N250 and N300 . <p> From the Toll Gate to Abule-Egba , the fare was increased from between N80 and N100 to between N150 and N200 . Some bus drivers also raised their fares to between N300 and N400 from the Toll Gate to Oshodi instead of the N150 and N200 that they charged on a normal day . <p> Also , a trip from Abule-Egba to Agege that attracted N50 before the sallah frenzy , now attracts N100 . <p> The situation was the same from Ikeja to Yaba and Ojuelegba as bus drivers hiked their fares from N150 to about N350 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iyana-Iba to Iyana-Ipaja rose this morning from N150 to N350 . <p> From Iyana-Ipaja to Abeokuta , the Ogun State capital , commuters that paid between N500 and N600 , had to pay N1,000 this morning with the drivers disclosing that the passengers may pay three times the amount during the evening rush period . <p> Though officials of the state Traffic Management Authority , LASTMA , were seen in major areas of the state , their presence only had a minimal effect on vehicular movements as therevehicles stood still on many of the roads . <p> Those who spoke with P.M.NEWS concerning the traffic challenge linked it to the frenzy surrounding the Sallah celebration . <p> " We do witness traffic problems once in a while on our roads , but it has been a major problem since late last week because of the Sallah celebration . <p> " Many residents are in a rush to get all that they need for the celebration . That is why you see a lot of people everywhere , " Musbau Tijani , a commuter bus driver told P.M. NEWS . <p> -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 14 , 2013 , 3:03 pm .

Islam is only an Arabic Cult . Nonsense . Yoruba people with their glutonous attitude . Most of the Rams transported from the northern part have been fed with some quranic incantation . Yorubas are not careful at all . If Hausa want to destroy Yorubas , it 's just a matter of poisoning foodstuffs and all spritually nurtured goat and cow they transport to Yorubas land .
