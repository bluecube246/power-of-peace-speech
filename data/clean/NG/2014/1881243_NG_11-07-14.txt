" the larger the economy , the lower the rate of growth is what obtains worldwide . even see what happened with the chinese economy in the 1990s , it grew at 15 per cent , but has slowed down to 7 per cent as output grew , " he said .  " we expected that there will be a corresponding reduction in ( nigerian ) growth ... it 's much easier to grow when you are small than when you are big , " he was quoted by reuters as stating also .  but rewane added that the economy was shocks .  " the nigerian economy is narrower with oil as the dominant revenue earner . south africa has a more balanced economy . the stage of development in nigeria is still primordial , which makes our growth vulnerable , " he said . there was no immediate reaction to the data in the equity or currency markets .  please leave your comment below . your name will appear next to your comment . we 'll also keep you updated by email whenever someone else comments on this page . your comment will appear on this page once it has been approved by a moderator .
