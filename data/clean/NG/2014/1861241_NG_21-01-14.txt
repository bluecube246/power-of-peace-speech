Inspired !  BN Prose : Glover Road Diaries by Ayodeji Rotinwa  AUGUST 1997 Father was , in his heyday , a bit of a treasure hunter . Mother told me one dark , quiet night when N.E.P.A had done that for which they were most popular . The lazy smoke from the lantern tickled our nostrils , stung our eyes and we had hungry , mosquitoes for company and unsolicited symphony .  I had been asking about Father for years . Mother had always waltzed around the question without answering . My friends in school had started to ask me the same questions I asked her . After coming up short and embarrassingly so , one time too many , I demanded the truth from Mother that night . I was only 8 years old but I used my grown up voice . I did not particularly miss having a father but I felt I had to know . Eghosa , my neighbour and friend 's father beat up his mother every other day , weekend , even on special days like Easter and that may do same to Mother .  Father , Mother said , was a skilled digger , finding his way deep in between the legs of many women who he told the sweetest nothings and made fairytale promises to . She would know . His charms worked on her . She told me she had given up her treasure to him while she was a student and he was a teacher in dusty old Epe , where he was posted to work at the time and where she was born , raised and lived . Theirs was a hot and heavy romance that lasted the entire period of her final year in secondary school . In this time , Father had probed every crevice , mined her treasure over and over again , more times than she could count . Then he left after being posted to another school in a different , farther location . Mother never heard from him again  Years after their first tryst , Father found his way back to Epe in hunt for another gem . A more important kind . A son . to show for his explorations . But a male son eluded him still . He had to have one . He would be the crown jewel of his children .  Mother had hated him for leaving her . He did not write or call . She had gone to university , and was rounding up her national service programme . She had not met or rather did not make an effort to meet a better half . Father had been her first and only love .  ' And as they say , the first love is the sweetest , the first cut is the deepest , ' Mother said nostalgia brimming in her eyes .  Father wooed her again . This time he wanted her hand in marriage . He was convinced , though he did n't say how , that it was she that would bear him that which he desperately wanted . After all , she was ripe , untouched after his own visitations , pure . Well , sort of .  She was hurt , angry but still went weak in the knees and . She knew he would not change his philandering ways . She knew he was married with six kids . She knew she was signing up for a lifetime of friction with the other women who courted his attention , who felt for him as she did and would do anything to keep him . She said yes to him .  Eleven months after the deed , she birthed me .  ' So why did he leave ? If he wanted a son so bad , why then abandon me and you , whom he claimed to love ? ' I asked Mother . I was confused .  ' And why did it take eleven months , not nine , to birth me , anyway ? That 's not what Integrated Science says , ' I said .  Mother sighed , smiled and fell quiet for a spell . She wrung her hands . Lines furrowed her forehead ; small , tightly wound like a meticulously assembled spider web . Her eyes watered . She shivered for a split second though the room was quite warm . life-altering . Heavy , unsaid words hung in the air with the now lightly fanning smoke .  ' Put off that lantern and change the wick tomorrow morning . I 'm off to bed , ' she said .  JULY 1998 The long road rolled on for what seemed an eternity . I could not see the end , having squinted repeatedly , trying to , though the sun rays that bore through the windshield of the car got in my eyes . It was so smooth , too , the road , without blemish . The granite gleamed like diamonds . There were no itinerant balls of refuse idling up and down on it . There were no wayward puddles of water either , the kind that gathered when rains fell , in my neighbourhood , in the open wounds of the road . As we drove on , tall , elegant palm trees appeared . They whispered to one another as the wind blew . I wanted to crane my neck , out the window of the car , to see how high they were but thought Only bush boys stared at palm trees as though they were an invention of note , he would say . The palm trees were interspersed by electricity poles that stood erect . The poles were not even poles at all but made out of stone . And they were erect ! In my neighbourhood , the electricity poles were made out of wood and mostly stood , the ones that were left standing anyway , bent at crooked angles , about to snap .  " This is Glover Road , Ikoyi , son . " He announced , quickly glancing at me . " A damn sight better than the hole I just picked you out of , I should imagine . " He stroked his beard and laughed . Father did this often when he felt he had made a fine point . I stared out the window once more noticing for the first time houses with numbers and names that confirmed that Father just said . 8 , 9 , 10 , Glover Road , they read . I was surprised I did not see them before . had tall gates , almost as tall as the palm trees . I could n't tell for certain . The gates were nothing like the short , thin strips of metal welded together that stood guard at the entrance of our compound . These gates were subtly ornate , thick and mostly , a forbidding jet black colour .  " And this is home , " Father said . We slowed down turning unto a small climb , stopping in front of a gargantuan gate , a bit bigger than the ones I 'd just seen . Number 13 , Glover Road , a calligraphic sign on the gate read .  NOVEMBER 1998 When three months ago , we entered the house , with its decadent chandeliers , handsome columns , pensive , brooding paintings , ornate furniture , the long winding staircase , and plum , fleshy rug , I had assumed I was in heaven . Hell soon came in form of an artificially beautiful woman that descended the stairs a few moments after Father and I entered the house . Her gait was delicate yet deliberate then suffocated it in the next . Her eyebrows were raised the entire time of her descent . Her skin had a brownish-white tinge , darker in some patches , more than others . Her knuckles were black . On her fingers were many stones , in different sizes and shapes of precious . Her hair was well-coiffed . Her lips were smeared in an alarming blood-like colour . She had a curved smile that did not quite reach her eyes , which seemed to be dancing frantically in a search for understanding , when she saw me . I understood . I was out of place here . I was in my school uniform , the only article of clothing in which I could look smart and my earth-weary Bata sandals .  " Ariyike , this is Ibrahim , he will be staying with us for his holidays , " Father said in Yoruba . He then walked away into a room with a door that melted into the wall . I did not see it there before .  Confusion mapped her face . I then realized Father who I was .  She eyed me . First up and down and then more keenly like I was a recently unearthed , long-searched for relic . A minute or two must have passed .  " Good Afternoon Ma , " I said .  She came closer , studying my face some more . Soon , knowledge formed in her eyes and her eyebrows met her hairline . She now knew who I was . She let out a soft gasp , first . Then she began breathing heavily like a wounded ox . Her fists clenched . Words frothed to her mouth , it seemed but nothing escaped her lips . She eyed me , up and down , again , this time ominously . It was a look I later became familiar with .  Ayodeji Rotinwa is a writer .
