You can add your own comments below . <p> The growth appears alright but as a shareholder , i hope it not based on the opportunistic banking reforms that shifted customers ' attention vulnerable though more efficient banks , as opposed to innovative business strategy . <p> First Bank Plc is a slow grower given the huge resources at its disposal and banking reform policies that tilt towards its advantage . Other smaller banks like UBA and Eco have relatively leaner resources but are felt all over Africa . <p> @Udendeh There is nothing wrong with being a " slow grower " especially when you consider the fact that the profitability opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa are very much limited . Several nations have GDPs much lower than some Nigerian states . You 've used UBA and Ecobank as examples of banks that are " felt all over Africa " but that does n't mean much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal . <p> Please leave your comment below .
