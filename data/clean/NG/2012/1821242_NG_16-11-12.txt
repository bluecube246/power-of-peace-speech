<p> The Uli , Anambra State-based Daniel Orjiako Memorial Foundation ( DOMF ) brought succour and relief to flood victims from Atani , Ogbaru , Ogwu Anioacha , Ogwu Ikpele , and Osamala , all in Ogbaru Local Government area of Anambra State and their neighbours of Akwa , Usham , and Okija in Ihiala Local Government across the Urashi River , a tributary of the Niger River , when the foundation 's chairman , Dr. Ambrose Bryant Chukwueloka ( ABC of ) Orjiako , a Catholic Knight of Saint Gregory the Great ( KSSG ) and an Officer the Federal Republic ( OFR ) visited them at their camps scattered in various places within Ihiala LGA . <p> The flood victims fall into two broad categories . Unlike the refugees from Ogbaru local government area whose houses and farmlands were submerged by the flood , the IDPs of Ihiala area only had their farmlands and crops entirely washed off by the flood . Though they are not refugees in the real sense of it as they still live in their houses , they nevertheless are all properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses they suffered and therefore entitled to relief in one form or the other . <p> In the wake of the floods , these coastline dwellers , just like their counterparts in other flood affected areas of the country , suddenly found themselves seeking shelter wherever they could find one in the upland areas . At the earlier days about 2,500 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) were crammed into one classroom block at the Community Primary School Umudara in Ihiala . Another 1,000 refugees are still scattered across parts of the surrounding villages in Ihiala including Akwa and Usham in Uli . Before the floods , these agrarian communities , lived off their farm lands and fishing . But within the space of one week of uncontrolled overflowing of the banks of the River Niger , these coastline dwellers looked on helplessly as everything they had laboured for were submerged by floods . <p> However help came the way of the nearly 3,000 IDPs , penultimate Friday as Orjiako the tireless philanthropist and oil magnate , undertook a " mercy tour " of the affected areas personally handing out relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them a lorry load of relief materials that included 150x50kg bags of rice ; 50x50kg bags of beans , several cartons of corned beef and sardines , 50 cartons of noodles , 20 cartons of tomato puree , five giant sacks of treated mosquito nets ( tmns ) , among other items . <p> Orjiako who is also chairman of Neimeth Pharmaceuticals International , equally came with a separate delivery van that contained several cartons of Niemeth branded drugs among them worm expellants , antiseptics , analgesics and various antibiotics . <p> Among those who accompanied the philanthropist on the tour were the former Member Representing Ihiala Federal Constituency Hon. Vitalis Okafor , the two serving State Assembly Members , Hon. Tokas Ohazulike ( Ihiala State Constituency 1 ) and Hon. Emeka Anohu ( Ihiala State Constituency 11 ) respectively . Also at hand was the Chairman of Ihiala Local Government Council , Hon. Chinedu Ukachukwu . From the religious were Monsignor Felix Ojimba and some priests , as well as the Principals of School of Nursing and School of Health Technology both at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Lady of Lourdes came because , Orjiako , himself an orthopaedic surgeon , insisted that the drugs must be warehoused at a dedicated hospital from where qualified medical personnel would administer treatment to the refugees to avoid drug abuse . <p> Explaining the motive behind undertaking the tour personally , Orjiako said the shocking pictures of the flood disaster moved him on television , while on a business trip abroad . He said although the Seplat Petroleum Development Company Limited , an oil company which he is the chairman , had earlier donated lorry-loads of relief materials to Anambra , Delta , and Kogi States through the respective state governments , he opted to undertake a tour of Ihiala refugee camps because he comes from the local government and so needed to personally commiserate with the victims . <p> Addressing the IDPs at Umadara Community Primary School camp , which still holds 1,500 refugees from Ogbaru LG , Orjiako urged the victims to always pray and believe that they will ultimately overcome the present setback and return to their homes pretty soon . A spokesman of the refugees at Umadara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said it was the first time they would receive such a high profile personal visit by any individual . Orjiako visited the headquarters of Ihiala LGA and the Usham camp where he met and commiserated with the refugees and equally distributed materials to them . In fact , he inspected some devastated farmlands washed off by the flood near Usham . <p> Earlier in a speech , the Uli LG Chairman , Chief Ukachukwu commended Orjiako 's public-spiritedness and promised that all the items would be judiciously distributed to all the victims . Ukachukwu said he has in place a medical team headed by a doctor who would liaise with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Ihiala to ensure the refugees received medical attention as and when needed . <p> Please leave your comment below .
