three men of courage  by bisi lawrence it is a common belief that each year rolls on , albeit gently or turbulently , towards its end and then , in the " ember " months , suddenly bears many of " its children " away .  it is indeed curiously noticeable that the pace of mortality seems to quicken during the " ember " months , though it is understandable in traffic accidents due to the increase in the volume of travelling all over the country .  but away from accidents on the road and elsewhere , the icy hands of death still reach out , it would appear , more frequently to rob the populace of dear ones , especially among public figures . so it has happened this year with the demise of two notable politicians and one eminent jurist , among others .  lam , eso and saraki  death came to all of them in comparatively old age . justice kayode eso , of the supreme court fame , died at 87 , nine days ago on the 16th away at 79 , on the 14th , and lam adesina , a former governor of oyo state , was 73 when he gave it all up on the 11th , all within one week of one another . they were not only associated in death , but also by a trait of courage in public life .  lam adesina was already identified with the title of a governor before he attained the position in oyo state . he was what you might describe as a " cool customer " , straight forward and self-assured .  always an activist , he had paid his dues before he went into real politics . he had by then outgrown the blessing or curse of a godfather . he occupied his office as the oyo state governor so well that he himself might be said to have become a godfather , so highly had his stature grown .  his aides still recount with admiration the way in which he faced down a former head of state , noted for his hectoring style . lam afforded him all the courtesy of his him in his position .  it was accounted an occasion of sound education for the former military leader who had arrived at the governor 's office with the evident intention of intimidating a " bloody civilian " governor .  in stead , he himself was reduced to an ordinary civilian who could do with better manners . that was a demonstration of sheer guts .  no less was it courageous of justice kayode esho to deliver that minority judgment in the awolowo versus tafawa balewa presidential wrangle . that the erudite jurist was above all forms of corruption in the discharge of his professional duties was very well documented in so many lawsuits .  but one of the defining cases -- in fact , the defining case to some people -- had to be that particular case . it was suffused with several significant features . apart from the momentous character of its purpose which was to decide the person qualified for the foremost political position of the nation , it was the one in which the acceptability of fractionalized humanity would be canvassed , and which precedent in the arbitration of a lawsuit in our history . justice eso sat tight , immovable ; he stood upright , unshakable .  it was indeed a defining moment , a glorious moment , for integrity . whatever one would like to say here has been recorded , and more , by the erudite first female san , who is an icon of the legal profession in her own right , mrs fola sholanke , in this tribute which she gave in an interview , describing the late justice as " one of the best of the best on the bench : " he lived his life as a god-fearing man .  as a justice of the supreme court , he represented the golden age . his legal knowledge was awesome . he was always ready to help . the thought that he is no longer here is too painful to bear ... he was very cerebral . "  erudition , yes ; integrity , yes ; but monumental courage too back it all up ..  senator olusola saraki , the late waziri of ilorin , his early days would testify . his manifest concern for the underdog , and his " vibrancy and flamboyance " are typical lagos traits .  his hectic political career , especially as a ranking member of the senate , depicted the stature of a man of muscular courage and consistency of purpose . he did not invite conflict , but never avoided confrontation being always confident in the power of the good volition . that was the source of his strength -- and he was very strong .  as babatunde fashola , the lagos state governor , eulogized : " the consistency of his political views , which he always expressed very eloquently , was perhaps responsible for the leadership positions which he held in both the senate , into which he was elected in 1979 under the banner of the defunct national party of nigeria , as well as the all-peoples party , of which he was the national leader in 1998 , and the peoples democratic party where his influence saw the election of his son , bukola , as the governor of kwarra state in 2003 whose ' counsel is most certainly needed , particularly at this time when our budding democracy is cutting its teeth and taking its challenging steps towards consolidation " .  nigeria will always need people like these , men of integrity and courage . they are role models at which we are seldom directed to look until they are gone and can be seen no more . a monument should be erected in marble to remind future generations of the valour of each of them
