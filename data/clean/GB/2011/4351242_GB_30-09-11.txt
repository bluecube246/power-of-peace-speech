Tony Blair : I could cash in a lot more than I do  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he could make a lot more money than he does as he defended his ' jet-set ' lifestyle .  The former British leader strongly denied claims that he had used his role as a peace envoy in the Middle East to win private business contracts .  Mr Blair used a wide-ranging interview to declare he had been upset by allegations that he had profited from mobile telephone and gas deals in the Palestinian territories , and that he had lobbied Colonel Gaddafi 's Libyan government on behalf of the merchant bank JP Morgan , because they were " untrue " and " absurd . "  His comments were made amid growing controversy surrounding his ' billionaire lifestyle ' and alleged pro-Israel bias in his role as envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East -- in which he mediates on behalf of the United States , Russia , the European Union and the United Nations .  In an interview broadcast last night on relationship with Rupert Murdoch and blamed the children of alcoholics , drug addicts and prostitutes for Britain 's recent riots , Mr Blair said recent allegations against him had been inspired by a left wing media establishment which resented him for creating New Labour , and a right wing establishment which hated him for winning three general elections .  " I probably spend two-thirds of my time on pro-bono activity , I probably spend the biggest single chunk of my time on the Middle East peace process which I do unpaid , " he said , adding that he raises money for his foundation to fight poverty Africa and his India-based interfaith foundation . " I left office in 2007 with two people and a mobile phone , I 've now got about 150 people working for me . So if what I was interested in doing was making money I could make a lot more and have a very gentle and easy life . When you talk about a jet set life , it means I spend a lot of time in jets , which is true " he from a deal to establish a second mobile telephone network in the Palestinian Authority , whose operator borrowed $2 billion from the merchant bank JP Morgan , which employs Mr Blair as an adviser , or from a $6 billion gas project in Gaza , where the operator British Gas is also linked to the bank .  " This is absolutely untrue .... the Palestinians had one mobile telephone company and were desperate to introduce competition which would give them hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue , it was the single biggest foreign direct investment in Palestine . I made absolutely no gain out of it at all . It was a long-standing commitment of the international community , " he said . He dismissed claims of a conflict of interest in promoting a Gaza gas project because the operator British Gas is also a client of JP Morgan as " tenuous . "  He defended his contacts with Colonel Gaddafi and said he had played a key role in persuading the former dictator to embrace the West .  " I 've never made any commercial deals " It 's true I used to see Col Gaddafi after I left office , particularly for the first couple of years , I was very instrumental in bringing him in from the cold when he gave up his nuclear and chemical weapons , started co-operating in the fight against terrorism . " He did however regret his failure to persuade Gaddafi to adopt internal political reforms . " I hoped he might shift internal policy to match external policy shifts but he did not , " he added .  The work of his foundation in Africa , his interfaith foundation in India , and his efforts in Libya and as Middle East envoy were completely separate from his business interests on behalf of Tony Blair Associates , he said . He admitted he had been hired by the Emir of Kuwait but denied it had any connection to his work as Middle East envoy for the Quartet .  " In respect of Kuwait , this is something I do completely separately from anything else . One part of what we do is we advise governments on building capacity absolutely nothing to do with what I do in the middle-east , " he said .  Mr Blair , whose private life has recently been the subject of some scrutiny with one Israeli newspaper linking him with a wealthy divorcee , said allegations over Middle East profiteering were hurtful .  The allegations were " certainly upsetting , in particular relating to the Palestinians , because it 's completely untrue . ... even me with my broad shoulders and thick skin after all these years , it 's not pleasant to have people say that , " he said .  Mr Blair also used the interview to defend Britain 's social fabric in the aftermath of the summer riots , which have damaged the country 's image overseas . He said the criminality witnessed during the violence gave misleading impression of Britain 's young people , who , he said , were more responsible and hard working than his generation had been . He blamed the violence on small numbers of young people from dysfunctional families . " The parents are often on drugs or have got alcohol problems , it 's a small number of families but they cause an immense amount of damage in local communities , " he said .  Mr Blair rejected criticism of his ' cosy ' relationship with media barons like Rupert Murdoch and said newspapers in Britain were such powerful " instruments of politics " that it was essential to have good relations with them .  " People often say you had too strong a relationship not just with Murdoch but with other parts of the media . ... and I always say to that : ' Look , if you 're in a situation where these guys , particularly if they hunt in a pack , can literally take out any ministers and make your government rock , you 've got no option to work hard and try to bring them around , " he said .  It was n't healthy , he added , but " the truth is you 're dealing with people who , if they decide to put one of their newspapers against you , what you find is not that the comment is against a very different thing . My analysis of this is not so much about a cosy relationship , it 's a relationship in which you are dealing with people who have got the capacity to do very great damage . "
