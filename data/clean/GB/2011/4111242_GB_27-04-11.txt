aretha franklin 's new album to feature obama inauguration song  my country ' t is of thee will be available to buy for the first time from 3 may .  when aretha franklin took to the stage at barack obama 's inauguration ceremony wearing an over-sized , swarovsky encrusted bow on her head it was a milestone in an already epic career .  while her distinctive headgear has been donated to the smithsonian , her performance of my country ' t is of thee will soon be available to buy for the first time with the release of her new album aretha : a woman falling out of love .  franklin is a committed democrat and a vocal civil-rights supporter . she sang at the funeral of martin luther-king and at the inauguration gala of bill clinton . she was personally asked by the then newly elected president obama to perform at his inauguration .  my country ' t is of thee , which was written in 1831 , served as a de facto national anthem for the united states until the significance for president obama whose children 's story " of thee i sing : a letter to my daughters " takes it 's name from one of the song 's lyrics .
