strange as it may seem after the backlash over the all-male shortlist for the bbc sports personality of the year , this has been an excellent week for the cause of british women in sport .  the issue of the media 's attitude towards female athletes has never been so hotly debated , and the ensuing row has given a voice to the likes of chrissie wellington , the four-time ironman triathlon champion , that would never have been heard had she made it on to the 10-strong shortlist only to disappear without trace when it came to the public vote .  remember 2007 when christine ohuruogu , fresh from her world 400 metres victory , polled just 0.71 per cent of the public vote to finish 10th and last ?  had wellington , rebecca adlington or keri-anne payne suffered a similar fate by propping up the list of nominees in the live vote , no-one would have batted an eyelid and the male dominance of the sporting agenda would have continued without comment .  but the fact they did not even make beat the rest of the world -- something the nominated andy murray failed to do -- has rightly turned the spotlight on the way women 's sport is viewed by sections of the media and the wider sporting public .  as illuminating as the protests by female athletes , sports officials and politicians has been the depressingly blinkered views of some male sports fans who felt motivated to join the debate on internet forums .  one of the most repeated comments was that they simply had n't heard of the female athletes who felt so hard done by , with the exception perhaps of double olympic champion adlington .  well qed . it is precisely because of their lack of media exposure that news of their world-beating achievements has failed to register with the sports pages-reading public .  either that , or there are some fans who simply ca n't bring themselves to go beyond the football , cricket and rugby pages to the hinterland of general sport .  but at least the issue has now been identified and brought into the open . inadvertently , done female athletes a great service .  the debate about women 's place in sport could not be more timely . the coming year offers a wonderful opportunity for female athletes to stand shoulder with their male colleagues and in many cases upstage them .  the olympics are one of the few sporting events where there is no gender inequality , despite the crass attempts by the middle-aged men who sit in charge of world boxing and badminton to create unnecessary distinctions by suggesting that female athletes should be made to wear skirts . the idea has rightly been rubbished .  but in terms of how medals are celebrated and reported on by the media , there is no discrimination when it comes to the olympics or paralympics . in the equestrian events , men and women even compete for the same medals .  in other disciplines , a gold medal is a gold medal , whether it is won by a woman or a man . few would dispute that the star of the 2004 athens olympics from a british point of view was double champion next summer , then she too will surely be the story of the games .  both holmes and radcliffe are former winners of the sports personality of the year award -- holmes after her olympic double and radcliffe two years earlier after breaking the marathon world record for the first time .  the chances are that london 2012 will produce another female winner . victoria pendleton perhaps , now that she has multiple medal chances in the velodrome , or jessica ennis if she can rediscover her heptathlon dominance . or maybe katharine grainger , who is now the favourite to win rowing gold with partner anna watkins after taking silver at the last three games .  the bigger question is whether a woman can win the bbc award in a non-olympic year , but the controversy of the last few days should ensure that , when future shortlists are chosen , our female world-beaters are not so blithely overlooked .
