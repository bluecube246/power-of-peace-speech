Saddington Baynes , who pioneered digital retouching in the ' 90s and CGI for advertising and automotive in the ' 00s , are celebrating their twentieth birthday this year with an updated brand identity and a new website at saddingtonbaynes.com , which launches today .  The innovative new brand identity , developed by Saddington Baynes ' in-house creative team , has been deliberately designed to adapt and evolve across each platform and over time . Based on the inkblot device , as used by psychologist Hermann Rorschach and artists from Leonardo Da Vinci to Andy Warhol , the identity alludes to Saddington Baynes ' emotive approach to image creation .  Saddington Baynes logo  Chris Christodoulou , Managing Director , says : " Our new identity is constantly animated online and features individual versions for each member of our team . Our use of the inkblot not only signifies the understanding we 've developed of the psychology and science of imagery , but also serves as a challenge to ourselves : to continue to pursue even deeper understanding of how to craft a consumer 's portfolio containing some of the most iconic advertising imagery of the last two decades , including work for Stella Artois , Volkswagen , Guinness and Honda , the new site also premieres a new magazine-style approach with an array of new projects and a host of behind-the-scenes articles and interviews with top 3D artists , retouchers and photographers .
