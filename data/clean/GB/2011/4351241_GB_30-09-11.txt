instant messengers  histories of momentous events are being written more rapidly . but does an increase in immediacy lead to a loss of perspective ?  in 1936 , a journalist for china weekly review called edgar snow travelled to north-west china to interview mao zedong . mao told his officials to greet snow with " security , secrecy , warmth and red carpet " , for he wanted him to perform a vital task -- to shape mao 's image in the west .  " mao offered snow a mixture of valuable information and colossal falsification which snow swallowed in toto , " write jung chang and jon halliday in their 2005 biography mao . " mao covered up years of torture and murder ... and invented battles and heroism in the trek across china , now astutely titled ' the long march . ' "  in life &amp; arts  the result , published in 1937 , was red star over china , a sympathetic account of the red guards ' campaign against the nationalists that influenced how mao was regarded outside how history would be written -- as did lenin , who provided a glowing introduction to john reed 's account of the 1917 russian revolution , ten days that shook the world ( 1919 ) .  yet these accounts -- especially that of reed , who was on assignment in russia for the socialist magazine the masses at the time -- also capture aspects of those events that would be impossible for a historian to recreate from scratch years after the event . whatever their shortcomings in completeness or historical perspective , they have documentary value .  intimate accounts of world-changing events are now well-established in non-fiction publishing , with numerous examples provided by the 2008 financial crisis and by political events such as this year 's egyptian revolution . michael lewis , whose 2009 book the big short narrated how hedge fund traders bet against the mortgage bubble , is back this month with boomerang , a tour of countries such as iceland and greece that are still suffering the aftermath .  john reed , who chronicled the russian revolution  indeed , history is being written took a couple of years to get from research to publication . lewis 's latest has been " crashed " by its publishers . he completed it on august 15 , incorporating material from articles written originally for vanity fair magazine , and it will be published early this month , just seven weeks on . yet even that turnround may come to be seen as leisurely in the new world of publishing .  the traditional delay of up to a year between a book 's completion and publication was partly enforced by the " pipeline " for distributing and marketing printed books -- big booksellers such as barnes &amp; noble in the us want to clear their shelves of one set of books before taking on another load . the rise of digital books , with ebooks now a bigger market than hardback books in the us , is shortening -- even eliminating -- this pipeline , allowing publishers and self-published authors to produce narratives more rapidly .  . . .  yasmine el rashidi 's first-hand account of the egyptian revolution , the battle for egypt , of books , was published by random house as an ebook in may , four months after the uprising started . among its competitors was tweets from tahrir , a collection of short observations on twitter by witnesses to the revolution . it was released in april by or books , which specialises in rapid publication of current events titles in electronic and print-on-demand form . or has also produced books on the bp gulf of mexico oil spill and the gaza flotilla .  this evolution raises big questions about the trade-off between immediacy and accuracy -- or at least perspective . the historian sits down long after the events have occurred with no need to please or flatter the participants to gain access , since most are dead , and the freedom to study a wide variety of sources . a journalist working at high speed has only what he or she witnesses and the details that others -- some with an agenda -- choose to divulge .  " none of us has the right perspective , given how quickly these events unfolded , and we wo n't " says andrew ross sorkin , the new york times journalist and author of too big to fail ( 2009 ) , which reconstructed the climactic events of the 2008 financial crisis in new york and washington . " if you try to write a great analytical book now , you will either be wrong or lucky . "  lewis says : " the last thing i want to hold myself out as is as a historian or a prognosticator . i have no clue where this is all going . i am not a wise man , i am a journalist . the historian 's advantage is that he knows how the thing ends . if the eurozone financial crisis ends in war , that 's one story . if it ends with germany owning half of greece , it 's another . "  reporters do have one edge on historians -- they can get to the scene before events fade . el rashidi , who went to tahrir square at the start of the demonstrations , says : " i did n't step back and think , very aware of feeling that something extraordinary was happening and wanting to share it . you can capture time and the smell and the colour of a place that can not be captured 10 years later . "  william cohan , author of three books about financial institutions -- lazard fr ? res , bear stearns and goldman sachs -- says : " i find instant histories to be incredibly valuable . you can talk to the people directly involved and you can check what they tell you against documents . email has become a great first draft of history -- it 's immutable . you can not argue with it . "  journalists also dig out things that might otherwise remain undiscovered . cohan says : " when i was researching lazard , people would hand me stacks of memos that felix rohatyn , a former lazard partner in new york or andr ? meyer , another former senior partner had written and had hoped would be buried and say , ' i knew someone like you would come along one day , so i kept them . because witnesses tend to reshape events over time . " it is critical to try to do the interviews in as close to real time as possible . i found that the further i got from the event , the worse people 's memory was about detail but the more definite their perspective . they believed they understood it better but they were wrong on facts . "  this human fallibility also applies to historians , lewis argues . " the advantage of knowing how events ended is double-edged because once you grasp the outcome , you start to arrange the facts to lead to that outcome . knowing the ending can distort your understanding of the middle -- you make it neater . "  but , as snow 's case showed , there is also a price for being on the spot among participants . mao could select a sympathetic biographer because plenty of others wanted to tell his story and access is often bartered by the key figures in contemporary events in return for favourable treatment . journalists , such as bob woodward of the washington post the wars in iraq and afghanistan , have been accused of writing accounts that flatter those who spoke to them most .  . . .  it is particularly difficult for the reader to tell fact from fiction -- or at least which version of the facts is closest to accuracy -- when journalists attempt to reconstruct events by talking to all the participants off the record and presenting a single version of what happened . that has been woodward 's modus operandi , as well as sorkin 's in too big to fail .  sorkin says this criticism is overblown . " i 'm not convinced that those who co-operate always get better treatment . i know of some people who co-operated with me and probably did n't get the treatment that they imagined . " but he admits that it makes such accounts harder for the reader or a future historian to analyse and unpack -- they simply have to trust the writer .  woodward 's books are rarely disputed by those whose actions and words he records , and sorkin 's was admired on wall suskind , author of confidence men , about economic policy under president barack obama , recently came under fire when three of his subjects , including christina romer , former chairman of the council of economic advisers , claimed to have been misquoted .  in principle , the two types of history -- an instant account and the long view -- are complementary . the journalist digs up the ground and tries to uncover facts immediately , and the historian assembles all the available data and adds perspective . rival versions of history may agree on the basic facts but shape them differently to produce varying conclusions .  but as contemporary history becomes faster and more partial -- and some versions are written in a style that is hard to prove or disprove -- it may become harder for future historians to gauge its value . the rise of digital media and the sheer deluge of data being recorded by individuals and released by organisations such as wikileaks , raises a further possibility -- that historians will be able to circumvent or to ignore the current accounts and go a few letters and historical records , they may have a plethora of real-time digital data to comb through .  twitter is only one example of this -- facebook pages , email , and photographs and videos of current events are all recent phenomena . yasmine el rashidi says she watched others in tahrir square holding up their phones . " they were not writing but you could see they were trying to capture the moment , " she says . they were , in their own way , competing to stamp their perspective on the event .  for now , the book tends to carry more weight than individual tweets , photos , or articles in newspapers and magazines . but that may be a historical anomaly -- the fact that printed books have traditionally been of a certain length and have taken time to assemble and publish . as ebook publishing speeds up , the line between books and extended magazine articles will blur . " there are people who insist that a book is a narrative form that is transhistorical , " says colin robinson , been defined as what a binding machine is able physically to hold together . if you remove the constraint , you are left with a continuum between a tweet and a tome . "  lewis says : " because an ebook is a book , it has this authority but , because you can turn it around so quickly , it has the immediacy of a piece of journalism . you are able to attract gravitas to things that were written very recently that you could n't generate before . "  that arbitrage will not last indefinitely . for the moment , anything that is produced by a book publisher is a book , no matter how immediate or distant the events it portrays . but as ebooks get shorter and are published faster , the difference in form will become evident . so too may the differences in value .  journalists and historians have always traded off speed against perspective , especially when covering momentous events . whereas journalists accept the challenges of time and space pressure , historians just try to get the story right , a billionaire financier 's body in his paris flat , a bullet hole in his heart . journalists pounce and report in real time . several of their bestselling books appear within months . a movie is in theatres soon after . yet historians do not even consider these events until key documents become available decades later . only then do they write about the financier 's schemes and correct the journalists ' early mistakes .  this setting looks like today , with instant media reaction and delayed historical treatment . yet the subject was ivar kreuger , the infamous " match king , " and the year was 1932 . even then , journalists scrambled to write the first draft of history . earl sparling and william stoneman , two leading journalists who wrote quick biographies of kreuger , were at least as fast as their modern counterparts , and at least as shackled . the definitive account of that era 's mania and crash did not appear until 1954 , with john kenneth galbraith 's the great crash , 1929 . it took even longer for biographers , straight .  a decade ago , there was no snap journalism , no minute-by-minute web-based reporting . today , every form of reporting is compressed . technology has not sped up writers ; it has sped up how quickly we see what they have written .  speed is valuable but so is waiting . will easily distracted modern readers value perspective enough to wait for it ? perhaps . serious history is well represented on today 's bestseller lists . these are books that even technologically savvy consumers prefer to read in paper , so they feel the weight of research on each page . in contrast , although we crave quick news and enjoy good articles and ebooks , we move those items to the trash as quickly as we buy them .  do n't expect the definitive book on the financial crisis any time soon . and i 'm sorry this article is so long ; i did n't have time to compose a twitter post .  frank partnoy is a professor of law and finance at the university of san diego school of law )
