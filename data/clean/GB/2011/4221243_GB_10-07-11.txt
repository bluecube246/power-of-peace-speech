" Thank you and goodbye . " <p> Newspaper staff had departed , amid scenes of cheering and emotion at the same London complex , in the early hours . Many employees saw themselves as having been sacrificed by Murdoch to save his broader business interests . <p> But Murdoch was signalling he was not bowed . He has already made clear he has no intention of yielding to criticism and removing senior executives , nor of giving up his proposed multi-billion-dollar buyout of British broadcaster BSkyB . <p> The newspaper he held high had a particular symbolic significance for Murdoch . It was the first British newspaper he bought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge media empire with political influence that , with the hacking scandal , has become the subject of much soul searching in Britain . <p> Admirers saw the demise of a national institution , famous for exposure of the misdemeanours of the rich , royal and famous , for its gossip and for its pictures of scantily clad women . <p> Critics saw in the closure a long overdue chance to cut back Murdoch 's ability to influence British politicians through his global media empire . <p> " The spectre of the old Murdoch , the one whose demise was signalled last week -- powerful , voracious and threatening -- must not be allowed to rise again from the ashes of the News of the World , " said an editorial in The Observer . <p> Copies of the last edition were selling well , said newspaper vendor Jean Natella at London Bridge Station . <p> " I think it 's a shame because they 've done a lot of good , they 've riddled out a lot of , let 's say , nasty people , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . But they have got no choice because they condemned others so they have got to show they are accountable . " <p> Regular reader Michael Mitchell , a revenue officer , said , " I do n't think it should close ; I think the people responsible should not be there . " <p> " They have , I feel , overstepped the mark . Or they 've been found out , because if this paper is doing it you can bet the majority of them are doing it as well . " <p> Researcher Jonathan Schifferes said journalism would be disgraced for a long time as a result of the ( phone-hacking ) allegations , and the scandal reflected badly on Britain . <p> The headline of the last edition was simple and unusually low key and underneath in smaller print added : " After 168 years , we finally say a sad but very proud farewell to our 7.5 million loyal readers . " <p> The words appeared over a montage of some of the paper 's most famous front pages , most of them involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Inside , the paper ran several nostalgic editorials charting its successes over the years , in addition to the usual fare of celebrity gossip , showbiz and other news . The only adverts the last issue carried were for charities . <p> The owners of News of the World made the shock decision to close the title on Thursday in the face of mounting criticism of its newsgathering techniques . <p> Claims of illegal hacking into the voicemails of stars , royals , families of soldiers killed in combat and a kidnapped girl later found murdered have engulfed parent company News Corp in scandal . <p> The print run for the last News of the World was bumped up to five million copies , nearly double the normal number , in anticipation of a spike in demand for the historic edition .
