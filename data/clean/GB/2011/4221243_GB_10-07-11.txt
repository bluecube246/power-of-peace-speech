" the world 's greatest newspaper 1843-2011 , " said the front page , held up for all to see . " thank you and goodbye . "  newspaper staff had departed , amid scenes of cheering and emotion at the same london complex , in the early hours . many employees saw themselves as having been sacrificed by murdoch to save his broader business interests .  but murdoch was signalling he was not bowed . he has already made clear he has no intention of yielding to criticism and removing senior executives , nor of giving up his proposed multi-billion-dollar buyout of british broadcaster bskyb .  the newspaper he held high had a particular symbolic significance for murdoch . it was the first british newspaper he bought , huge media empire with political influence that , with the hacking scandal , has become the subject of much soul searching in britain .  admirers saw the demise of a national institution , famous for exposure of the misdemeanours of the rich , royal and famous , for its gossip and for its pictures of scantily clad women .  critics saw in the closure a long overdue chance to cut back murdoch 's ability to influence british politicians through his global media empire .

"  regular reader michael mitchell , a revenue officer , said , " i do n't think it should close ; i think the people responsible should not be there . "  " they have , i feel , overstepped the mark . or they 've been found out , because if this paper is doing it you can bet the majority of them are doing it as well . "  researcher jonathan schifferes said journalism would be disgraced for a long time as a result of the ( phone-hacking ) allegations , and the scandal reflected badly on britain .  the headline of the last edition was simple and unusually low key and underneath in smaller print added : " after 168 years , we finally say a sad but very proud farewell to our 7.5 million loyal readers . "  the words appeared over a montage of some of the paper 's most famous front pages , most of them involving  inside , the paper ran several nostalgic editorials charting its successes over the years , in addition to the usual fare of celebrity gossip , showbiz and other news . the only adverts the last issue carried were for charities .  the owners of news of the world made the shock decision to close the title on thursday in the face of mounting criticism of its newsgathering techniques .  claims of illegal hacking into the voicemails of stars , royals , families of soldiers killed in combat and a kidnapped girl later found murdered have engulfed parent company news corp in scandal .  the print run for the last news of the world was bumped up to five million copies , nearly double the normal number , in anticipation of a spike in demand for the historic edition .
