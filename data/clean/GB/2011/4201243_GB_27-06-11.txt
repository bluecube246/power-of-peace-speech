Other users get refunds after shipments were months late  A court has ordered an online trader to refund consumers to whom he failed to deliver goods or pay refunds , the UK 's consumer protection regulator the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) has said .  Pavan Arora must payback customers who bought technology products via websites he operated , the Cardiff County Court ordered , according to the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) . The OFT had brought action against Arora for violating consumer protection rights , it said .  Customers on Arora 's websites who paid extra for " same day delivery " or " express delivery " services did not receive the products as promised , the OFT said .
