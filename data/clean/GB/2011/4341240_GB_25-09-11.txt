Birch , who is now head of restructuring and insolvency at accountants PKF , told BBC Radio 5 Live 's Sportsweek programme : " They simply can not generate sufficient revenue when Man Utd are earning ? 3m a game and Everton ? 500-700k .  " The gulf is just too great for them to compete .  Did you know ?  Trevor Birch was the last player signed for Liverpool by Bill Shankly , but left without making an appearance for the club .  " When someone looks at Everton and says they want to buy the club the first thing they have to do is look at building that stadium . A stadium costs ? 300- ? 400m . Who is going to make that investment ?  " Basically they are buying a club that has incurred losses of ? 30m over the last five years . So you are not going to make any money and have to build a stadium . "  Birch , a former Liverpool player who was also chief executive at Leeds , Chelsea , with great stability , which Everton have , with the younger players coming through , you could look with enthusiasm to the future .  " But what they wo n't do is ever compete for the league title again in the short term . "  BBC links  This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets ( CSS ) enabled .
