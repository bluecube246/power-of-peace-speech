http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15051909

birch , who is now head of restructuring and insolvency at accountants pkf , told bbc radio 5 live 's sportsweek programme : " they simply can not generate sufficient revenue when man utd are earning ? 3m a game and everton ? 500-700k .  " the gulf is just too great for them to compete .  did you know ?  trevor birch was the last player signed for liverpool by bill shankly , but left without making an appearance for the club .  " when someone looks at everton and says they want to buy the club the first thing they have to do is look at building that stadium . a stadium costs ? 300- ? 400m . who is going to make that investment ?  " basically they are buying a club that has incurred losses of ? 30m over the last five years . so you are not going to make any money and have to build a stadium . "  birch , a former liverpool player who was also chief executive at leeds , chelsea , with great stability , which everton have , with the younger players coming through , you could look with enthusiasm to the future .  " but what they wo n't do is ever compete for the league title again in the short term .
