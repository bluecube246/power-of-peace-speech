RELATED ARTICLES  Share this article  Researchers inoculated 17 healthy people with the flu virus and monitored their progress for five days .  Of the sample , nine became ill and the rest showed no symptoms at all .  Using technology usually employed in satellite imaging , they examined the genes in the subjects ' blood samples every eight hours .  Those who became sick developed an acute inflammation on certain genes 36 hours before the symptoms set in . This ' genetic signature ' was most marked in those who were suffering the worst .  Meanwhile , those who remained fine were found to have activated a totally different genetic signature .  The scientists interpreted this signature as an ' anti-stress response ' that showed their bodies were actively fighting off the virus . This discovery raises the possibility that experts could find a way to detect flu early , and take preventative action before the worst effects develop .  Professor Peter Openshaw , of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College , said : ' This is has very big implications for many infectious diseases , not only flu .  ' It could help with flu pandemics and even allow us to detect lethal infections such as the ebola virus at a very early stage . '  Dr Alfred Hero , the University of Michigan academic who led the research , said : ' We looked at over 22,000 genes in 267 blood samples . No study of this magnitude has ever been done on human immune response .  ' We can start to tease out the biological conditions that might make one more resistant to getting sick .  ' We will be testing it on different strains of flu , and it may not just be flu , it may be the same for other viruses including the common cold . '  A think-tank yesterday called for the flu jab to be given to everyone over 50 .  The International Longevity Centre said while Britain 's childhood immunisation programme was among the best in the world , adult immunisation had been neglected .
