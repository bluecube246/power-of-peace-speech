<h> Arctic sea routes open as ice melts <p> Image caption Last year , the Peter 1 yacht sailed around the Arctic using both passages <p> Two major Arctic shipping routes have opened as summer sea ice melts , European satellites have found . <p> Data recorded by the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Envisat shows both Canada 's Northwest Passage and Russia 's Northern Sea Route open simultaneously . <p> This summer 's melt could break the 2007 record for the smallest area of sea ice since the satellite era began in 1979 . <p> Shipping companies are already eyeing the benefits these routes may bring if they remain open regularly . <p> The two lanes have been used by a number of small craft several times in recent years . <p> But the Northern Sea Route has been free enough of ice this month for a succession of tankers carrying natural gas condensate from the northern port of Murmansk to sail along the Siberian coast en route for Thailand . <p> " They 're often open at the same time in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed Peter Wadhams , an Arctic ice expert from the University of Cambridge . <p> This year again confirms that we are in a new regime with substantially less summer iceLeif Toudal Pedersen , Danish Meteorological Institute <p> " But this time they 've really been open , with a proper Suez-size tanker going through the Northern Sea Route with a full cargo - that 's a real step forward , " he told BBC News . <p> A number of major shipping companies are looking to the opening of these routes to shorten journey times and make their businesses more efficient . <p> But environmental groups are concerned that the progressive ice loss will lead to increased exploration for oil and gas . <p> This , they argue , presents major safety hazards in the often inclement Arctic , as well as strengthening the world 's reliance on fossil fuels and so ensuring the progression of man-made global warming - and the disintegration of summer sea ice cover . <h> Model figure <p> The Arctic sea ice has been melting fast this year , and for a while it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area in the satellite record . <p> Image caption The two Arctic passages combine to form a route right around the region <p> However , in recent weeks it has been running a narrow second to 2007 . <p> " The minimum ice extent is still three to four weeks away , and a lot depends on the weather conditions over the Arctic during those weeks , " said Leif Toudal Pedersen , senior scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute . <p> " Whether we reach an absolute minimum or not , this year again confirms that we are in a new regime with substantially less summer ice than before . <p> " The last five summers are the five minimum ice extent summers on record . " <p> The volume of sea ice continues to decline annually . <p> Professor Wadhams believes the advent of summers where the two sea routes are routinely open is not far away . <p> " The Northwest Passage is probably the less reliable because you 've got so many small passages in it where chance variations in wind will pile ice up and block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the ice retreats from the coast of Siberia , you 'll have a route there . " <p> Some computer models forecast that the Arctic could be completely clear of summer sea ice within a decade , though others recently published say there may be high years and low years en route to the final disappearance . <p> Canada and Russia are among the governments jockeying for position as new areas of the seabed open up for exploitation .
