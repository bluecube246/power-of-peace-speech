<h> The Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , has expressed " surprise " that the public is not more angry with the bankers who caused the recession . <p> In some of his strongest language yet , Mervyn King today claimed the fall in households ' living standards was the fault of the financial services sector and he expressed sympathy that innocent families paying the price . <p> " The people whose jobs were destroyed were in no way responsible for the excesses of the financial sector and the crisis that followed , " he told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee . <p> In most aspects , he said , the economy had been on a sound footing before the crisis . Previous downturns were often caused by inefficiencies or weak management and were useful opportunities to improve systems . " None of that applied in this crisis , " he said . " We had quite a successfully operating economy . " <p> The people who are now suffering " did not get bonuses of the scale people in the financial sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago but , as austerity measures kick in , " the cost is now being felt " , he said . <p> It remains " a big political problem " , he added : " I 'm surprised the real anger has n't been greater than it has . " <h> Related Articles <p> The Governor also warned that living standards may be permanently lower than where they would have been under the economy 's trend growth rate before the crisis . " The evidence of the past is that the impact of a financial crisis like that persists for many years , " he said . <p> " You may not get it back for very many years if ever . It 's a very real hit on living standards . That 's why it is important to take the issue of financial stability very seriously . " <p> Making a personal commitment , he said he hoped to ensure the banks would never again be allowed to cause a recession of the scale just witnessed . " I joined the Bank of England 20 years ago today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave until we have a framework in place to ensure we do n't have to go through this again . " <p> The Governor also expressed concern about the legislation being enacted to give regulators greater powers on bank supervision . He said the Bank would have preferred a new Act rather than amendments to the existing law , but that he was satisfied with the current plans . <p> Andrew Tyrie , chairman of the TSC , suggested the current plans are a " pig 's ear of a legislative process " . <p> The biggest change to banking supervision , Mr King said , would be to " move to a regime that does countenance failure but does not cause havoc with the financial system " . Regulators will pay closer attention to whether a bank can fail safely rather than continue with " excessively detailed scrutiny of the big banks " . <p> His position appeared to contradict that of his future deputy governor Hector Sants , currently chief executive of the Financial Services Authority , who has said the new regime would have a " low tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that 's where we are now .
