when gcses are as good as a degree  one in seven university graduates earns no more than the typical worker who left school with just gcses , while one in five earns less than a worker whose education ended with a-levels , official figures show .  the study found that workers with a university degree still generally earn more than less-educated peoplephoto : alamy  a growing proportion of graduates are ending up in low-skill jobs such as cleaning and hospitality , the analysis from the office for national statistics also disclosed .  comparing employment data for 1993 and 2010 , the ons found the financial advantages of a degree have fallen as the number of graduates has risen .  the study found that workers with a university degree still generally earn more than less-educated people .  by the end of last year , the median pay for graduates -- the mid-point of the salary range -- was ? 33,500 , the ons said . but 20 per cent had salaries below ? 20,800 , the median pay for those educated to workers earn less than the median wage of someone who left school after taking gcses , which was around ? 18,000 last year .  related articles  evidence of the declining financial benefits of a degree has mixed implications for the coalition 's arguments for its higher education policy . university tuition fees will next year rise to as much as ? 9,000 year . ministers say the higher price is justified by the higher salaries that graduates earn over their careers .  on the other hand , the fact that many graduates earn relatively low salaries could help one aspect of the coalition 's case . under the new fees system , low-paid graduates will not have to repay their loans . the ons report also suggested that the expansion of the higher education sector has outpaced changes in the uk economy itself . in 1993 , around 12 per cent of the population had a degree . by the end of last year the figure was 25 per cent .  however , the percentage of uk jobs classed as " high skill " posts only rose result is that more graduates end up in posts for which they are over-qualified . the share of graduates finding " low " or " lower-skilled " jobs grew from 9 per cent to 16.8 per cent . those jobs include posts as cleaners , postal workers , hotel porters , secretaries and retail assistants .  in 1993 , almost seven in 10 graduates ( 68.3 per cent ) went into high-skilled professional posts . by the end of last year , that had fallen to 56.6 per cent .  the department for business insisted that a degree " remains a good investment " for young people . a spokesman said : " our studies show that graduates earn , on average , around ? 100,000 more across their working lives , as well as other benefits such as greater rates of employment and improved health status . "  universities uk , which represents the sector , also insisted that young people should still aspire to a degree . the group said : " uk graduates are still in a better position to succeed and remain highly valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
