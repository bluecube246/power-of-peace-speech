you are here :  the good , the bad and the multiplex by mark kermode review  mark kermode 's latest book asks the question : what 's wrong with modern movies ? here 's our review of the good , the bad and the multiplex ...  if you 've got a sense of bafflement over how modern day cinema can give us three $1bn+ grossing films in a year , but still wo n't stump up for an individual projectionist or an usher or two down at your local multiplex , then you 'll be in good company with mark kermode 's latest book .  the good , the bad and the multiplex is a fleshing out of many of the arguments familiar to those who listen to the kermode and mayo film programme on radio five live . and , teased with the subtitle ' what 's wrong with modern movies ? ' , you might be forgiven for thinking that you 're getting 313 page of full-on kermodian ranting .  but you 're not . instead , you 're getting . interestingly , it 's less than you might think about some of the films themselves ( although michael bay 's christmas card list is rarely likely to have kermode 's name on it ) , but rather the apparatus and system that surrounds then .  firmly in kermode 's crosshairs are 3d , multiplex cinemas ( illustrated through a painfully funny attempt to watch charlie st cloud at his local cinema ) , blockbuster movies , film critics , and where britain itself fits into world cinema .  take 3d as an example . the world has no shortage of anti-3d rantings , but what kermode presents in his book is an argument . an argument very much in his own voice , with his own strong viewpoint on the matter . but an argument nonetheless , which takes in both sides of the debate , before arriving at a conclusion , albeit one more obvious than the ending of your standard rom-com . dripping with rounded examples , kermode is n't trying to bully you to his way of thinking -- rather , he 's being accessibly . this is n't a film where hardened film buffs only need apply . just as with his last book , it 's only a movie , kermode 's writing style is chatty and welcoming , fused with energy and a love of his subject matter .  ironically , the people who the book may end up appealing to the least are kermode 's regular listeners . he captures many of the key themes of his radio broadcasts here , but there are inevitably fewer surprises for those more familiar with his work . that said , the chances are that you 'll find yourself nodding along with much of what he has to say anyway , and it 's a strong , well-researched , entertaining representation of his thoughts that you 're getting here .  if i had a personal favourite part of the book , it 's when he pinpoints the problem of distribution , and how it 's becoming harder and harder for small films to get a look in . here 's where some of his arguments hold the most surprises , and you 'd good , the bad and the multiplex generates in exchange for this particular system being fixed .  and that 's the critical thing , here . kermode has a passion that you may or may not personally warm to , but it 's a thirst and desire for things to improve nonetheless . it might be idealistic at times , but it 's hard to criticise someone for that . there 's a longing in his words for cinema to get better , and as such , it 's a brisk and easy book to read and digest , with lots of thinking matter for afterwards .  personally , i 'd just about edge it 's only a movie , kermode 's previous book , over this one . but it 's a close run thing , and with the good , the bad and the multiplex , kermode has one again married up strong arguments with quality writing . it 's a book well worth seeking out .
