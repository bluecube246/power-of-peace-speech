Discovered earlier by Dmitry Fedotov and Denis Kurta , it was ugly and tortuous , but it opened the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , courtesy of Alexander Klimchouk <p> Bill Stone , half a mile deep and three miles from the entrance in a Mexican supercave called Cheve , did stop . Red-and-white plastic survey tape hung across the narrow passage he had been ascending . The message , scrawled on notebook paper , was affixed to the tape at chest level . Afloat in the cave 's absolute darkness , the white paper burned so brightly in the beam of Stone 's headlamp that it almost hurt his eyes . The time was shortly before midnight on March 1 1991 , though that made no particular difference -- it was always midnight in a cave . <p> Stone , a hard-driving man with a doctorate in structural engineering , stood 6ft 4in tall and weighed 200lb . He was one of the leaders of an expedition trying to make the last great terrestrial discovery by proving that Cheve was the deepest cave on Earth . <p> With three companions , he was halfway through the gruelling , two-day climb back to the surface from the cave 's deepest known point , something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The note and tape had been strung just before the expedition 's Camp Two , where four others were staying . <h> Related Articles <p> They explained to Stone what had happened . At about 1.30pm , a caver from Indiana named Chris Yeager , 25 years old , had entered the cave with an older , more experienced man , Peter Haberland . Yeager had been caving for just two years , and going into Cheve was , for him , like a climber who had been on only small Vermont mountains suddenly tackling Everest . <p> Seriously concerned about the younger man 's safety , a veteran , elite cave explorer named Jim Smith sat Yeager down for what should have been a sobering , 30-minute lecture : do n't go into the cave without a guide , carry only a light daypack at first , learn the route in segments , get " acclimatised " to the underground world before going in for a long stay . The warnings fell on deaf ears . Yeager started his first trip with a 55lb pack , planning on a seven-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the top of a cliff that had been named the 23-Metre Drop because it was exactly that , a 75-feet free drop from lip to pit that had to be rappelled . By supercaving standards , where free vertical drops hundreds of feet long are common , this was little more than a hop down . Haberland went first , completing an easy rappel without incident . At the bottom he detached his rappel rack ( a metal device resembling a big paper clip with transverse bars ) from the rope , then moved away to avoid any rocks Yeager might dislodge . <p> Above , Yeager was wearing standard descent equipment , which included a seat harness similar to those used by rock climbers but beefed up for the heavier demands of caving . A locking carabiner ( an aluminium loop , about the size of a pack of cigarettes , with a hinged " gate " on one side ) connected the harness to his rappel rack , and the rappel rack connected him to the rope . The rope wove through the rack 's bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder . Before going farther , Yeager had to transfer his rack from the rope he had been descending to a new one . <p> He made the change successfully , leant back to begin his rappel , and realised instantly that something was wrong . The rope did not stop his backward-tilting motion . Instead , he kept going , as if tipping over backward in a chair . Somehow his harness had become separated from the rappel rack , which was still attached to the rope . <p> Instinctively , he lunged to grab the rope and the dangling rappel rack , but his heavy pack made any self-arrest impossible . He fell so quickly that he did n't have time to scream . <p> As the 21st century began , we believed that every one of the Earth 's great discoveries had been made . Almost a century had passed since Peary first trod the North Pole and Amundsen the South . Hillary and Norgay summated Mount Everest in 1953 , Piccard and Walsh dove the deepest ocean in 1960 . Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of discovery were wrong . When the third millennium rolled round , one last great terrestrial discovery did still await : the deepest cave on Earth . <p> The subterranean world remains the greatest geographic unknown on this planet -- called " the eighth continent " by some . Mountains , ocean depths , the moon , and even Martian scapes can be -- and have been -- revealed and explored by humans or our robotic surrogates . Not so caves . They are the sole remaining realm that can be experienced only first-hand , by direct human presence . <p> There are also rabid bats , snakes , troglodytic scorpions and spiders , radon , and microbes that cause horrific diseases . Kitum Cave on the Kenya-Uganda border is believed to be the birthplace of the Ebola virus . <p> By the turn of the 21st century , three crucial things had become clear about the last great terrestrial discovery . First , it probably would be made within a decade . Second , it would almost certainly be made in one of two places : the Abkhazia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oaxaca , in southern Mexico . Finally , one of two men would lead the discovery team . They were the Ukrainian Alexander Klimchouk and the American Bill Stone , both of whom had devoted their lives to the search for the bottom of the world . <p> Klimchouk and Stone fit nicely into a list of opposites . Klimchouk is short and slight . Stone is towering and muscular . Klimchouk is quiet , self-effacing , and avuncular . Stone is bold , brash , and commanding . For Stone , science is a means to an end : exploring . He sees himself as a " pioneer " who opens new realms where others can follow . For Klimchouk , it is the other way around : science is the end and caves are the laboratories in which he does it . <p> It was in 2004 that the stage was set for an epic race to find the deepest cave on Earth . Even the normally staid National Geographic magazine borrowed a phrase from Jules Verne to describe it : " The Race to the Centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Mexico , and the Krubera cave , in Georgia , have very little in common . <p> Both are true supercaves , thousands of feet deep and with many miles of surveyed passages , but there the similarities end . Cheve resembles a gigantic L , with an initial shaft dropping about 3,000 feet and an elongated foot descending for almost two more miles at a moderate slope of roughly 10 degrees . Krubera , on the other hand , is 90 per cent vertical , pitch ( a vertical drop ) after pitch connected by short passages called meanders . While non-cavers would be terrorised by the yawning pits , one of which is 500-feet deep , experienced cavers look forward to their thrilling rappels , if not to their grinding ascents . <p> Traversing Krubera 's many meanders is like crawling under your car ( while half submerged in flowing water ) for thousands of yards . The caves ' body temperatures are also different . Cheve is cool but relatively mild , with air temperatures that range from 47 degrees at its entrance to the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Krubera , on the other hand , is freezing , the kind of cold that , when you 're working with water and wind , can quickly put you into third-stage , potentially fatal hypothermia . The inflowing water is never much more than 32 degrees ; unprotected survival time in water that cold is 15 minutes or less . <p> In a supercave every step taken , every knot tied and soup bowl filled and latrine used and map read requires the circle of light from a headlamp or flashlight . Prolonged , absolute darkness has profound effects on the human body and mind . Veteran Texas caver R D Milhollin made his first Cheve entry during a 2003 expedition . Reaching Camp Two , he and his three companions settled in to eat and sleep for a day or two . Wanting to conserve batteries , they kept their lights off except for essential tasks . After not very long , though , they confessed to one another that the cave was doing strange things to their minds . <p> Milhollin was hearing phantom noises and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . They decamped promptly the next morning . <p> Stone had never hesitated to proclaim to the world that Cheve had a proven potential to be the deepest cave in the world , even if it meant spending more than a month underground and diving far enough to effectively separate from the main expedition . He also knew that Krubera had the potential to go just as deep , and that Klimchouk was determined to prove that it did . Stone decided to make his all-out attempt in Mexico in 2004 . His expedition party left Austin , Texas , on February 22 2004 . <p> The general population of supercave explorers breaks down into specialist subtribes : leaders and Sherpas , bolters and ropers and riggers , lead climbers and divers and diggers . Diggers endure hours of confinement in squeezes so tight they can barely breathe and can move only one hand . They dig like giant moles , using tools ranging from their fingernails to hi-tech titanium implements to gasoline-powered hammer drills . <p> Diggers are essential to supercave exploration . It is not unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockages are breakdown ( jagged boulders that had broken from the ceiling over aeons and continued to do so unpredictably ) and boulder chokes , but quite often they are not truly terminal . If the cavers can feel air movement coming through a wall of breakdown or boulders , it makes sense to try to find a way through . <p> In March 2004 , John Kerr , one of the world 's greatest diggers and another caver , Bart Hogan , were burrowing down a tunnel in the Aguacate River Sink Cave , which Stone hoped would link to the main Cheve cave . Kerr took the lead with his titanium tool and burrowed 150 feet forward . Hogan , crawling a good distance behind , called to Kerr . <p> No reply . Hogan called again and again , with no response . He was beginning to fear the worst -- that Kerr might have suffocated -- when the other man finally came backing out with frightening news . The tunnel 's ceiling had collapsed on him , burying the length of his body to eye level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , " he reported calmly . <p> On March 22 , without a major breakthrough , Stone 's team returned to the surface . They had made it no further than 4,869 feet ( 1,484 metres ) deep . Stone vowed to return . He had not proven Cheve to be the deepest cave on Earth . It remained to be seen , halfway around the world , what Klimchouk and his cavers would prove about Krubera in 2004 . <p> Supercaves teach those who explore them any number of things , and scepticism is a big one . The numbers work like this : hundreds of promising leads produce a few dozen explorable passages , which , most often , end in piles of boulders or flooded tunnels or simply blank walls . Once in a great while , an explorable passage will go , and once in an ever-greater while , one will just keep going . But those , the fabulous ones that have no stop in them , are rare . <p> Klimchouk quantified how things had played out over the years . Of hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent yielded more depth and distance ; only one per cent produced substantial breakthroughs . <p> Klimchouk led an expedition to Krubera in August 2004 , paving the way for another effort in October . At that point , he had been in the field for two and a half months . He could not manage another month away from family , university , and laboratory . Someone else would have to lead the next effort . <p> Yury Kasjan was the logical choice . He knew Krubera as well as anyone . Like Klimchouk , Kasjan was a fine leader , quiet but good-natured ; had unbelievable stamina ; and was technically adept at all aspects of extreme caving . <p> Nine cavers would work underground in two separate groups . The first group included Kasjan and Emil Vash , a tall , slender 22-year-old student ; Ekaterina Medvedeva , 23 , Igor Ischenko , 36 , and Kyryl Gostev , 21 , rounded out the team . They would be the expedition 's spearhead . <p> Day by day , like mountaineers climbing up to successively higher camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On October 11 they occupied the 1,400-Metre Camp . That lowest spot would become this expedition 's jumping-off point . Everything previous was just preparation . <p> To reach that camp , however , they had to get themselves , their gear , and their supplies through a short but treacherous sump . In common usage , a sump is a place , lower than its surroundings , where liquid collects . Sumps in caves are long , winding , flooded tunnels . In places they are so tight that divers have to stop , doff their tanks , push them through , and then follow , donning their equipment again only when the passage widens sufficiently . <p> That description really does not do the procedure justice , though , because you remain connected to your air tanks only by the regulator hose and mouthpiece . It takes not much force at all to yank the mouthpiece from between your teeth , and if that happens , in what is almost certain to be zero visibility , your chances of finding it again before you drown are not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment was not absolutely essential . But it was long and tight enough to stretch a breath-hold dive to its extreme limits . Because bringing scuba gear involved another whole dimension of logistics , Kasjan had elected to traverse this sump by breath-hold diving . Vash knew he would have to go through if he was to have any chance of reaching Krubera 's bottom . <p> On October 12 , the day of the planned sump crossing , Vash found himself too nervous to eat breakfast . He had been told that the underwater tunnel was about 30 inches high and 10-feet long . What made it so dangerous was that it was just 18 inches wide , roughly the diameter of a large pizza . In addition , its walls were rough and spiked with protrusions that could easily snag a caver . It would not take long to drown in those conditions . <p> He would do well to be able to hold his breath for 60 seconds in water that cold . Throw in the added factors of panic and wild attempts to extricate oneself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a premonition that he would not make it through , but he pushed on regardless . He hyperventilated to blow carbon dioxide out of his system , held a last breath , and dove . His premonition quickly came true . He did n't submerge deeply enough and , halfway through , his helmet caught on a ceiling obstruction . <p> Panicking , he flailed back out of the sump and surfaced , unnerved and gasping . It had been one of the worst moments of his caving career . <p> Though it had taken only 20 seconds or so for Vash to extricate himself , it had seemed much longer . His exertions had consumed the oxygen in his system voraciously , causing him to feel suffocated much too quickly . Reflecting later , he could remember nothing specific during the incident , just a black space filled with terror . <p> Cavers are nothing if not persistent . Calming himself , Vash went in once again , taking care to go all the way down to the tunnel 's floor this time . He cleared the ceiling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it pressed against the surface of his body and helmet . This was a very tight scrabble while completely submerged in zero-visibility , 32-degree water . He had been told to expect such conditions , but as veterans of combat can confirm , no matter how great the effort , thinking about such things is never adequate preparation for their reality . <p> Over the next few days , both teams brought more supplies to the deep camp , creating caving 's version of the high camp in mountaineering , the final resting place before the launch of the summit assault.Working so hard that deep , Vash was discovering something as true in supercaves as it is for mountaineers on 8,000-metre peaks : the body does not really recover under such conditions but deteriorates more or less rapidly , depending on the individual . Most supercave expedition members lose a pound a day or more ; few are fat to begin with , their bodies soon begin eating their own muscles . <p> The explorers spent October 18 sewing up tattered dry suits , collecting odds and ends of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . They were all aware that they could well be on the verge of making history . After a huge supper , everyone went to bed at 9.25pm . Maddeningly , despite his exhaustion , Vash was so excited that he could not sleep that night . He got up early : 6.05am . This was it , the sharp , final point to which everything had brought them . <p> At 9am they left camp ; they arrived at the Large Fork 90 minutes later , bringing along heavy bags of rope and hardware to explore any breakthroughs . In profile on a map , the new section of cave leading downward looks something like a decrepit stairway . Vash and Gostev set about surveying one set of passages and pits . Surveying finished , the pair climbed back up to the Large Fork , rejoined the others , and then all descended to the place where Kasjan and Medvedeva had been working . <p> Vash perceived at once that this section was both beautiful and promising . The limestone reminded him of the delicate hues of raspberry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here , too , the pitches were both wider and steeper -- harbingers of depth . Presently , the entire team was gathered at the deepest point Kasjan and Medvedeva had reached . It was a small chamber , on the far side of which a steep pitch dropped off into darkness . It was eerily quiet . Kasjan was studying his altimeter intently . At some point during the last half-hour , they had exceeded 2,000 metres -- 6,562 feet . This in itself was an epochal milestone , akin to the first ascent of an 8,000-metre peak . <p> The next pitch would tell the tale . Kasjan adjusted his helmet lamps and slipped into the opening . Medvedeva followed , then Vash , then the others . They worked their way down three more vertical pitches separated by inclined passages and finally dropped into a triangular-shaped room , perhaps 15 feet on a side , with a flat , clay bottom and nondescript brown walls . Their light beams danced over floor and walls like frantic white spiders , but they could see no more windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tri-cornered room 's clay floor there was a circular , craterlike depression about three feet in diameter and two-feet deep . Down at its bottom , the hole came to a point , like the drain in a sink ( which it might well have been at one time ) , and in that spot was lodged a small white rock . Vash and the others leant over the hole in Krubera 's floor as Kasjan used his altimeter to calculate the depth of that ultimate white rock . He straightened up , waited a moment , and announced : " Two thousand and eighty metres " . The team erupted with cheers . <p> Discoverers in caves are privileged to name their new finds . It did not take long to reach consensus about the bottom of the world . They knew where they were , and how very long it had taken to get there , and how many other explorers had made this final act possible . They gave the place a name that , they hoped , captured all those things : Game Over .
