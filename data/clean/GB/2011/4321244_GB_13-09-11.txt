<p> Since the Tube upgrade programme began in 2003/04 , network delays per year reduced by 27% , but August 2010-January 2011 saw the longest sustained period of poor performance on the Tube since upgrade work started . <p> Industrial action accounted for around half of the increase in lost passenger hours between 2009/10 and 2010/11 . <p> Caroline Pidgeon , chairman of the assembly 's transport committee , said : ' ' Passengers spent an extra six-and-a-half million hours on the Tube in 2010/11 because of the increased number of delays . This is clearly unacceptable and a drag on London 's economy . <p> ' ' We know delays on the Underground have fallen overall since 2003 , but TfL must ensure that last year 's 20% dip in performance is a blip - not a disturbing sign of things to come . ' ' <p> Bob Crow , leader of the Rail Maritime and Transport union , said : ' ' The repeated breakdowns and infrastructure failures on the Tube can be blamed fairly and squarely on cuts to maintenance and the expensive failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting by years of mismanagement of the London transport budget and a recent wave of signal failures and breakdowns shows clearly that a dire situation is getting worse . We have less than a year to sort this crisis before a surge of visitors arrive for the London Olympics . ' ' <p> Mike Brown , managing director of London Underground , said : " The Tube is approaching 150 years old and we are currently undertaking the biggest upgrade in its history - replacing signalling , trains and track to boost capacity and provide passengers with more reliable and more comfortable journeys . <p> " This ca n't be achieved overnight and some disruption is inevitable as the work takes place . However , Londoners rightly expect reliable journeys , and we are completely focused on making sure that we deliver that . <p> " There clearly was a dip in overall performance at the end of last year , but the programme of measures that we have introduced since then has meant that we have turned that around , as the latest figures show . <p> " Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed work on the Jubilee line , we are delivering some huge improvements on the Tube and we continue to make the case to the Government for the investment needed to ensure this continues . <p> " We will also do all we can to make sure that , where upgrade work means that closures are necessary , we complete the work in the quickest possible time and give our passengers all the information they need on what we are doing and how to avoid disruption .
