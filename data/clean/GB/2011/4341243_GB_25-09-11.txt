Bull Bear Market Phases, Dow Theory Update
http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article30621.html

bull bear market phases , dow theory update  according to dow theory , both bull and bear markets have three phases . between each of these phases there are important counter-trend moves . our dow theory founding fathers explained that these counter-trend moves are misleading and tend to be taken as a continuation of the previous long-term secular trend . based on the longer-term phasing and value aspects of dow theory , the evidence continues to suggest that the last great bull market began at the december 1974 low and peaked in october 2007 . this data also continues to suggest that the decline into the march 2009 low was merely the phase i decline and that the rally out of the march 2009 low serves to separate phase i from phase ii of a much longer-term secular bear market .  that 's right , the rally out of the march 2009 low was not a new bull market or a continuation of the previous long-term secular bull market . rather , it is part of a correction within a much longer-term secular bear market based on my longer-term bull and bear market relationship studies and other historical characteristics , the evidence suggests that once the rally out of the 2009 low has run its course , the phase ii decline should prove to be far more devastating than the phase i decline . therefore , from a longer-term perspective i remain very bearish .  more recently , on august 4th both the industrials and the transports closed below their march 2011 secondary low points . as a result , a dow theory trend change occurred and since this is the first such trend change since the rally out of the march 2009 low began , we can not take this development lightly . however , history shows that not all dow theory trend changes are ominous and based on other technical data , there is a very good chance that the rally out of the march 2009 low has not yet run its course . if not , the rally separating phase i from phase ii is not yet over . the details of these other technical studies are covered in the monthly research a bit of a technical high wire act in that while we do have a dow theory trend change in place , on the other hand there is also other data that is actually still rather bullish and that suggests a higher level low is being made . this may or may not change and as a technician the key is to monitor the ongoing structural and statistical developments .  based on the prevailing consensus , the current pessimism actually makes perfect sense . as a rule , the market does what it has to in order to confuse the most people . ever since the decline into august began , it seems that the consensus has turned rather bearish . in fact , i personally know of no one that genuinely believes a move back above the may 2011 high is possible and maybe it is n't . but , i do find it very interesting that such bearishness is being seen in conjunction with such inconclusive technical data . as a result , it seems that the most confusing thing the market could do is to continue to the 1966 to 1974 bear market period below for comparison . the decline into the 1966 low marked the phase i decline of the 1966 to 1974 secular bear market . this decline appears to be synonymous with the decline into the 2009 low . the rally separating phase i from phase ii of the 1966 to 1974 bear market carried price up some 26 months into the 1968 top . i continue to believe that the rally out of the march 2009 low is synonymous with the rally into the 1968 top . once all of the technical factors are in place i look for the fallout to be much the same as was seen following the 1968 top . i realize that the same old message and comparison is not exciting or sexy . but , the message of the market it is what it is as the bear continues to confuse the masses . once the technical dna markers are all in place , the phase ii decline should get very very nasty . in the meantime , it currently appears that a much larger trap is likely commentary that is available at **31;0;toolong the specifics on dow theory , my statistics , model expectations , and timing are available through a subscription to cycles news &amp;
