<h> You are here : <h> Looking back at Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets <h> Our look back at the Harry Potter franchise continues , as Mark delves into 2002 's The Chamber Of Secrets ... <p> Three days after Harry Potter And The Philosopher 's Stone was released worldwide and broke box office records here , there and everywhere in its opening weekend , production pushed forward on the first sequel . <p> Warner Bros had all of the cast contracted for the first four films , and immediately exercised its option for part 2 , targeting a November 2002 release date . Behind the scenes , Steve Kloves reprised his screen-writing role and Chris Columbus returned to the director 's chair . <p> Picking up a few weeks after the first film 's happy ending , Harry Potter is pretty miserable . He has n't heard from his wizarding friends all summer and he 's living with the Dursleys once again , who enact a classic sitcom situation , with Uncle Vernon 's boss coming round for dinner in the first ten minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobby materialises in Harry 's bedroom ! Sitcom antics aside , Dobby is here to get the story going , by insisting that Harry does n't return to Hogwarts for his second year , lest he fall prey to a terrible evil . Via flying Ford Anglia , Harry is soon rescued from his relatives by the Weasleys . <p> It 's not long into the school year , however , when that terrible evil rears its head . According to a message daubed in blood , the Chamber of Secrets has been opened by the heir of Hogwarts co-founder , Salazar Slytherin . And now the horror from within the chamber is loose in the castle , trying to kill off students . <p> Here 's a story that lends itself to arguments about the logic of keeping Slytherin open at Hogwarts . Maggie Smith 's Professor McGonagall always mentions Slytherin last when listing the school houses , and with such an inflection that she might as well have said " Evil House " instead . It 's a vagary of the film series , that it never quite explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's students into a house with a reputation for turning out evil wizards . Still , this one delves into Hogwarts history and introduces one of the series ' central themes , that of prejudice . <p> In wizarding genealogy , having two wizarding parents , who only have magical heritage , makes you ' pure-blood ' However , it 's also possible to come into magical power even if your parents are non-magical Muggles , which makes you ' Muggle-born ' . ' Half-bloods ' , which come up later in the series , are the result of a union between a pure-blood and either a Muggle-born or a Muggle . <p> With me so far ? Well , there 's naturally some in-fighting amongst the different types of wizard , largely fuelled by the pure-bloods , and Slytherin alumni 's deep-seated ignorance about Muggle-borns . Muggle-born Hermione , arguably the most talented student of the lot , is on the receiving end of racial hatred with the invented slur " Mudblood " . <p> This development gives a nastier edge to schoolyard bully , Draco Malfoy , played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by Jason Isaacs . The two of them are condescending and cruel , and their family 's been pure-blood Slytherins for centuries . That makes Draco the prime suspect as the heir of Slytherin , as far as our trio of amateur wizarding sleuths are concerned . <p> If you have n't guessed , that detour fills in for their suspicion of Snape in the first film , and once again , it turns out Lord Voldemort is the root of the trouble . The method of his return through his 16-year-old self 's diary becomes intrinsically important towards the end of the series , but that 's a link for another time . <p> As far as the B plots of the film are concerned , the usual blind reverence to the source material is present and correct . Detours spring up left , right and centre , tenuously linked from scene to scene in an attempt to hold the abrupt tonal shifts as part of one story . <p> At one hundred and sixty-one minutes , this film is the longest of the series , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , few of the Harry Potter films are more successful in preserving the complexities of the Christiesque mystery story that Rowling weaves into her novels . Then again , it 's no less sudden when the baddy turns out to be Lord Voldemort , hiding under an anagram . <p> Tom Marvolo Riddle , Voldemort 's real name , was nearly reverse engineered by Rowling from " I Am Lord Voldemort " , something that Columbus literally spells out in flaming letters on the screen . Anagrams are a dangerous route to take , because it gets fans looking for patterns that are not there . A few years ago , factions of book fans were convinced that the name of wand-making shop Ollivander 's was code for either ' Ronald lives ' or ' Ronald 's evil ' . <p> On the topic of Ronald , Rupert Grint 's performance sums up so much of what is misjudged in this instalment . Directed to squeak and squeal for comic effect in action scenes , it actually foregoes the actor 's natural comic timing and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's saddled with ripe dialogue like " The invisibility booster must be faulty ! " <p> But it 's no easier for Daniel Radcliffe , whose particular brand of wonderment takes on the form of just repeating certain words questioningly . Both actors ' voices had broken in the year since they filmed the first one , so perhaps that 's why it feels like they 're adjusting to their roles all over again . <p> As usual , the grownups fare better . New additions to the cast , along with the brilliant Jason Isaacs , include Kenneth Branagh as vainglorious Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart . He 's a character who 's ultimately swept into a subplot , despite being present for part of the climax , but Branagh justifies his inclusion with an enjoyable comic turn . Stay for after the end credits , too . <p> A special mention ought to go to Richard Harris , who passed away a week before the premiere of this film . In his two turns as Professor Dumbledore , he exudes wisdom , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly humour and reassuring presence . Also , the character appears to get drunk and cancel all exams at the end , probably ruining the academic chances of older students . So , at least he finishes in style . <p> It 's good to see Toby Jones ' performance come through the CGI Dobby , although WETA Digital also created a much more lauded digital character through Andy Serkis ' rendition of Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings : The Two Towers , released a month after this one . In fact , all of the CGI is much improved from Philosopher 's Stone , the biggest achievement being the Basilisk , a giant snake that appears in the final act . <p> But , really , the star of this film is Stuart Craig for his production design . This film arguably holds some of his most accomplished work on the series , with grand sets like the Weasley homestead , the Burrow , and the titular Chamber of Secrets looking absolutely stunning on screen . There 's no faulting the visuals in this one , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But each of the different directors on the Potter series tended to emphasise different aspects , leaving their own imprint and telling the story through different means . Chris Columbus essentially made two films that were very much like his earlier film , Young Sherlock Holmes , although the source novels are very close to that template themselves , boarding school mystery stories . <p> But if Philosopher 's Stone was quaint , Chamber Of Secrets feels slightly cheesy . The humour is hit and miss , and certain emotional beats come across as mawkish and sentimental . The final scene , especially , is pure Camembert . It 's not the tone you want for a story in which a giant snake attempts a genocidal rampage against schoolchildren . <p> Terry Gilliam , who was beaten to the director 's post on Philosopher 's Stone by Columbus , has been less favourable in his assessment . Believing himself to be the perfect fit for the series , Gilliam once told The New York Post that " ... Chris Columbus ' versions are terrible . Just dull . Pedestrian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secrets is a tantalising one , and it is a shame that he never got to helm one of the films . <p> Much more than its predecessor , Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets feels like it 's made up of tentative steps into a new world . It 's hobbled slightly by the unwavering reverence for the source material , which ultimately makes it less creative than its own production design . As Gilliam said , it 's more pedestrian , the kind of adaptation Warner Bros wanted at that stage . <p> It 's not a bad movie , by any stretch , and parts of it are very good . But when you see what was to come post-Columbus , it feels like a missed opportunity of sorts . After the speedy turnaround on this sequel , the series would go on to a regular cycle of one film every eighteen months , and so 2004 's Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban would bring a major sea change .
