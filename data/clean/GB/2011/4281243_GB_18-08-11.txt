<h> Stadler wins London Tramlink tram order <p> UK : Stadler Rail has won a contract to supply six Variobahn trams to increase capacity on the Tramlink light rail system in south London , Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced on August 18 . <p> The first of the new trams is scheduled to be delivered ' this winter ' and all will enter service in spring 2012 , allowing a more frequent service to be operated on the busiest part of the network through central Croydon between Therapia Lane and Elmers End . <p> Three of the trams will be taken from a batch of five which were ordered for the Bybanen light rail line in Bergen but not yet delivered to Norway ; Stadler built these earlier than the 2012 contractual delivery date to make use of free capacity at its Pankow plant in Berlin . Stadler will also build three trams directly for Croydon , plus three replacements for Bergen . <p> At 32 m the five-section air-conditioned Varobahn trams will be 2*5 m longer than Tramlink 's existing fleet of 24 Bombardier CR4000 vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The contract is worth ? 16*3m to Stadler , including spare parts and related equipment . The London Borough of Croydon is contributing ? 3m to the purchase cost . <p> ' Perception is important , and the perception today is that things are really beginning to move again in Croydon ' , said council leader Mike Fisher . ' By spending heavily on extra trams we 're backing what we 're saying with hard cash . The tram network has proved to be a huge hit with the many thousands who use it on a daily basis . It 's fair to say that , at peak times during the day , the network has become a victim of its success . These new trams will ease that burden ' . <p> Sign up for the free Metro Report International e-mail newsletter to get the latest metro and light rail news from around the world sent direct to your inbox every two weeks .
