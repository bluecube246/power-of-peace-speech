John Gosden: 'Flat racing is in peril. the future is in the East...'
http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing/john-gosden-flat-racing-is-in-peril-the-future-is-in-the-east-2360971.html

<p> There are very few racehorse trainers who would , or could , bring Bob Dylan , FC Barcelona , Roberto Duran and an economics lesson into a 45-minute discussion about the sport of kings . Indeed there might only be one : the ferociously intelligent , fiercely eloquent and altogether rather formidable John Gosden . <p> He would be formidable even if he did n't stand six foot and quite a bit in his stockinged feet , but his stature somehow compounds the sense that this is a fellow whose views are worth listening to , especially when they concern the future of his beloved Flat racing . Moreover , 60-year-old Gosden is the turf 's man of the moment . Masked Marvel won him his second consecutive ( and fourth overall ) St Leger just over a fortnight ago , and his high-class colt Nathaniel might just bag him his first Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp next weekend , unless the Indian summer that the rest of us are craving goes and spoils the plan . <p> " The horse is in good form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday morning at Newbury , but the key factor for a lot of us is the weather . If the ground is on the fast side there he wo n't run . " The decision will be made on Thursday , but if Paris stays dry , Gosden will miss out for at least one more year on the opportunity to add the Arc to a CV that includes the Epsom Derby , the Breeders ' Cup Classic and the 1,000 Guineas , as well as those multiple St Legers . " But we do still have the Qipco Champions Stakes on 15 October at Ascot , which is a pretty nice fallback position , " he adds . " It 's just one of those odd years when the ground looks like being fast for the Arc . " <p> Whatever happens , Gosden has already realised his overriding ambition as a trainer , which was n't to win the Derby , affectionately as he describes the way that his horse Benny The Dip did so by a short head in 1997 . " He went round Epsom like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personally , winning the Breeders ' Cup Classic in 2008 at the place I started training with three horses in the late 1970s , Santa Anita , meant a touch more . That was the closing of the circle . " <p> Gosden , whose father ' Towser ' Gosden was a leading trainer of the 1950s and 1960s , got a job as an assistant with Noel Murless after graduating from Cambridge , then joined Vincent O'Brien in Ireland . But it was in California that he really cut his teeth , at a time when racing in the United States was still basking in the fading glow of a golden era . <p> " I was so lucky to be there at that time . The place was humming , there was great closeness between trainers and jockeys , and fabulous , very remunerative racing . It was the second biggest spectator sport after baseball , and when I started a lot of the old Hollywood set still owned horses . But that has changed . Nascar racing is very big now , the car is more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people find travelling to the racetrack a bit of a bore . " <p> In 1989 Gosden set up shop in Newmarket , and for the last six years has operated out of Clarehaven Stables , just a few furlongs from Sir Michael Stoute 's empire . It is there that we talk , and I ask him whether his time in America continues to inform his training techniques . " Oh , I think you absorb things when you are young and they become part of your make-up . Bob Dylan has been accused of plagiarising songs , but it 's not that , it 's being influenced by people you respect , whether you 're writing music or training racehorses . " <p> He continues to observe America carefully , and sees in the decline of racing there all kinds of grim portents for what might happen here , in fact he feels that the downward spiral is well under way . <p> " It has happened very quickly . The economy has entered a period of stagflation , which is going to hurt any entertainment industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high cost base and we 're very labour-intensive , requiring extraordinary capital investment . I hope nobody ever does a study of what it costs for these people to breed and produce horses , because we 're talking thousands of millions . Consider the land , farms , stallions , mares , foals , staff . It 's a very expensive game to produce enough horses for the very large fixture list we have in this country . The foal crop is in decline , the horses that can actually race will be more and more cherished , and there will not be sufficient horses to fulfil the fixture list . " <p> A fleeting sigh , possibly as much to draw breath as anything else . " There is a lot of pressure on the game , " he continues , " and a lot of pressure on tracks . In time I would n't be surprised to see a few tracks go , and I do n't think that will be a bad thing , because I 'm of the opinion , as Lester Piggott is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling every slot with mediocre racing , and all we 've done is land ourselves with the law of diminishing returns . With the decline in prize money , it 's very difficult to come in and play , because racehorses are so expensive to breed . People seem to think they drop out of the sky , but they do n't . Young people are being born all the time who can become great footballers . The scouts go everywhere and find them , or the academy at Barcelona nurtures them . But imagine if football clubs had to go out there and breed them , select the right parents , pay for their housing . " He leans back in his chair , analogy complete . " People take it for granted that the great equine athlete just tips up , but that 's really not how it works . " <p> Flat racing in Britain , then , as Gosden sees it , is in distinct peril . Yet that is not so elsewhere in the world . " The future of Flat racing is all to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Australasia , China . Geopolitically we 're up against it , although we still have time to put things right if there 's a will . Sticking heads in the sand is not the answer . " <p> So what is ? And does he think the horseracing authorities can find it ? " Well , in fairness to them they do n't have a lot of power . It 's all about the government , and what they 're prepared to do with a gambling bill . It is in the government 's interest to have a healthy entertainment industry , and this branch of it employs huge numbers of people and generates quite a lot of money for the Treasury . So , they need to bring offshore betting back on , rein in the betting exchanges , and introduce strict legislation whereby a return is made to the people who put the show on . Until and unless that happens we 'll see nothing but a gradual deterioration in the quality of racing . We do still have the finest horses competing in the most prestigious races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not last . " <p> I 'm clear , yet it occurs to me that Newmarket is both the best and the worst place to issue such stentorian warnings . It is a town made affluent by racing , and there seems no manifest sign of the affluence diminishing , not so long as Gosden , Stoute and Sir Henry Cecil continue to train winners , not with Sheikh Mohammed continuing to pour in his millions . <p> " Yes , there are people passionate about racing and always will be , but for the new people thinking about coming into the game , there are other things they can do with their money . This is a time for businesses to sustain themselves , not think about growth . I 'm a bit cynical about economic growth generally . There 's a finite limit to what this planet can take . What 's wrong with healthy sustainability ? I do n't want to see the game grow . I want to see it rationalised . " <p> It 's time to bring Gosden down from what I suppose might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sense . And so I switch topics , to the great Vincent O'Brien , whom he had the privilege to study from closer quarters than most . <p> " Yes , and apart from anything else he had an extraordinary business brain . A brilliant horse sense , but also fine commercial sense . Like Alec Head he could have gone into many professions and reached the top . He was very selective in what he did and did n't train . When I was there he had 70 horses , and that to him was too many . He wanted speed , lightness and agility from his horses , even the Grand National horses , and he set Ballydoyle up in that way . He was so good at getting inside the horse 's head , and of course that 's our job , every day . They ca n't talk to us so we have to sense what they want and do n't want . He was also a very shy man , very good one to one , but he did n't like crowds . That word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was true of him . He had all the attributes . " <p> Gosden was at the Irishman 's side in 1977 , when Piggott won the Derby , for the eighth time , on the O'Brien-trained The Minstrel . " Lester had been trying to get on Blushing Groom ; as usual he had spotted the best horse . But the Aga Khan would n't have it . He left Henri Samani on . So on the Sunday morning before , the phone went . It was Lester . He said : ' Tell the old man I 'll ride whatever he 's got left in ' . We had three left in : The Minstrel , Valinsky and Be My Guest . The Minstrel had been beaten in the 2,000 Guineas , and everyone said he would n't stay , but Lester saw something and gave him one of the all-time great rides . " <p> Unsurprisingly , Gosden considers Piggott the greatest , the jockey for all the ages . " But Willie Carson was superb . And there is phenomenal talent now . Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable jockey reminds me of the young Steve Cauthen . Frankie Dettori is a wonderful chameleon ; he can ride anywhere in the world . Some of the young boys coming through in France are phenomenal . Not so much in America . Gary Stevens told me that the weighing-rooms there are not the same as they were . He said , and these were his words , ' there 's not the respect for horses ' . The horse has become just a means to an end . " <p> I tell Gosden what Piggott asserted to me in a recent interview , that riding styles have become too uniform . He agrees . " Yes , although I have the utmost respect for jockeys . As athletes they 're like Roberto Duran , and on so little food . They have amazing strength , and yet you can never overpower a horse ; it has to be done with feel , with great hands , with a gentle touch . I can see what Lester means , though . Do they use their legs as much as they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with the legs . It 's amazing what they can do with their legs . For someone like Lester , who operated very much on his own terms , it must be pretty dull to watch . Certainly Kieren Fallon has a style all of his own . But there 's more conformity now . And that 's true generally . Every high street in every town looks the same . " <p> I leave before Gosden starts on the economics of high-street retailing , although he doubtless could , and would . There are some horsemen who , like some of their charges , go through life wearing blinkers . Not so the impressive squire of Clarehaven.
