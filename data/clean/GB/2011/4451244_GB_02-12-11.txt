Great expectations for brand Dickens

<h> 4/5 <h> 5/5 <p> There is a cartoon of Charles Dickens from 1868 , when he was filling theatre halls to the rafters with the most sensational , most lucrative of book tours across America . He is shown standing with his manager , George Dolby , disgruntled as he counts the skyscraper-high piles of dollar bills on the table , and ruing the fact he has not earned more . <p> The Victorian writer was , by this time , in his commercial stride , a celebrity earning the equivalent of around ? 30,000 a night in a dynamic one-man act in which he regularly knocked out his " greatest hits " -- scenes from A Christmas Carol , Oliver Twist and Nell Trent 's death from The Old Curiosity Shop -- to the delight of rapt audiences . This snide , satirising cartoon , that now hangs in the Dickens Museum , reflects how the American press came to see him by the end of the tour -- as an author who did little to hide the sharp commercial voracity that ran alongside his abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dickens brand is as big and as powerful a cultural export as ever , beloved abroad and on the verge of making yet more skyscraper-shaped piles of cash for his bicentenary next year , which coincides with the Olympics and the Queen 's jubilee , and which is being globally marketed alongside these two mammoth events . <p> The Dickens brand will be big business on the home front -- there is a bewildering amount of exhibitions , debates , films and plays launching throughout 2012 , and an equally dazzling array for overseas audiences . The British Library , Museum of London , and British Film Institute have begun early by staging some of their Dickens fare this month . The British Council is hosting events in 50 countries and Dickens 2012 , the umbrella group co-ordinating festivities , anticipates a rewarding return investment . <p> Florian Schweizer , director of the Dickens Museum and Dickens 2012 , explains that , while the latter does not have a central budget , a comparison could be made with the 250th anniversary of Mozart staged in Vienna in 2006 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The budget of ? 21m ( ? 18m ) for the Mozart celebrations in Vienna reaped enormous return dividends through inward tourism -- ? 43m with wider economic production value at ? 300m . The celebrations led to a hike in Austrian GDP and increased employment . <p> " It 's always difficult to put a value on cultural activity but I can see the Dickens bicentenary being comparable to the Mozart celebrations . Our celebrations will stretch from New York to Zurich to Paris to Toronto . There will be activities in London , Kent and Portsmouth , so it will also stimulate internal tourism . We have the Olympics , the Queen 's jubilee and the Dickens bicentenary named alongside each other as the three key events of 2012 . The three will feed into each other to the point that it will be almost difficult to pull them apart , " says Schweizer . Dickens would undoubtedly have approved . In his lifetime , he had a strong relationship to the money-making machine around him , however distasteful this may have seemed to the American press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , a clerk in the Navy , spent much of his life overspending , in debt , and imprisoned for it . Dickens aimed to live by the same dictum as the fictional Mr Micawber , who correlated money with happiness in David Copperfield : " Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six , result happiness . Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery . " <p> The young Dickens was hugely insecure about money . He feared his writing would stop appealing to the public and wrote letters in the 1840s citing Sir Walter Scott 's fate ; as a celebrated , wealthy writer of his time , he died without leaving his family financially secure . Juliet John , Professor of Victorian literature at Liverpool University , and author of Dickens and Mass Culture , says he wrote letters about money all the time . " When he did public readings , which were really PR tours , from the 1850s onwards , he would write to friends literally characterising the audience as pounds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially secure was 1846 , at the age of 34 , when he was no longer at the mercy of debtors nor obliged to his publishers . He had become a classic rags-to-riches story -- his own Pip . By this time , he had children who proved to be as improvident as his father as well as two households to keep -- that of his estranged wife , and his mistress . He fought for copyright in Britain so that his children could receive an income after his death . <p> Alex Werner , curator at the Museum of London , who has co-written Dickens 's Victorian England 1839-1901 , published next week , says his work was so popular that , even before a serialised story was complete , theatre managers were staging full productions with their own endings . " He got very cross with these unauthorised works . Copyright laws were in their infancy . In America , his work was being published in pirate publications . " <p> When he went to America for the second time in 1868 , he received a starry welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his first public speech , he made mention of this , by opening up the touchy subject of international copyright . <p> " The Americans did n't understand it when the first thing he spoke about was that , if they did n't introduce international copyright , they would never have a literature of their own , and they 'd just steal works ... by the time he left , he was seen as a greedy , money-obsessed person , " says Schweizer . <p> Victorian Britain did not hold such a cynical view . His public readings were incredible money-spinners but it was clear that he loved being close to his audience and performing for them . A would-be actor , he would put on different voices for characters . <p> So what does the Dickens brand represent now , and why has his work thrived , endured and continued to bring in investment ? <p> For one , he is among the very few literary figures , alongside Shakespeare , whose characters have gained a ubiquity across cultures . He is on school curricula as far afield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scrooge " is used in the Philippines as a noun , as it is in Britain ) , while Robert Douglas-Fairhurst 's new book , Becoming Dickens , lists Dickensian words which have since entered the vocabulary . <p> It could also come down to the flexibility of his fiction , which represents different things to different people . " Heritage Dickens " gives us a nostalgic slice of Britain , full of fog and narrow streets . " Campaigning Dickens " flags up urban poverty and social injustices that still exist today . <p> " Even in his own lifetime , he was a genius at presenting different images of himself to different markets . When he spoke to a working men 's institute , he would emphasise his class loyalty . In private letters he would talk of his radicalism but never ... in public , " says Professor John . <p> Not only do his novels cross class divides , encompassing the lives of servants and masters in the way that Shakespeare did before him , but they cuts across genres -- so within Great Expectations there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detective and romance narratives , rolled into one . Toby Litt , an author and panellist in a British Council conference in Berlin which will assess Dickens 's relevance today , talks of a " unique audience that is not subdivided " . <p> " His appeal crosses generations . It 's like Harry Potter , written for children and adopted by adults . That 's why he 's still there in popular culture , " he says . There is a universal kind of " survival struggle " at play in many of the stories , he adds . " His characters are in a world which does not have a welfare state . It 's a world without a safety net and they are facing basic problems of getting enough to eat , finding friendship , staying warm -- basic problems that people around the world still face . " Despite the harsh social realities , some maintain that it is the fossilised version of London that charms international audiences -- his street urchins and perennially fog-bound urban landscapes provide a definitive , quintessential version of Englishness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says this side of Dickens hit him when a writer from Shanghai came to visit . <p> " It was her first time here and she wanted to see Dickens 's London . I could n't think of where to take her to show her the mud , fog , narrow lanes and high tenements of his fiction . She ended up in Starbucks , looking for men in bowler hats . On her second visit , I took her to the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub on Fleet Street , a distilled bit of Dickens . " <p> This is the " Heritage Dickens " that Professor John says has helped to transform Dickens into an international tourist phenomenon . The regular costume-drama TV adaptations have aided the fossilisation , she says . " Very few of them are done in modern dress , in the way you see many Shakespearean adaptations . " Dickens World , the themed area in Kent that includes a Great Expectations log flume , a Haunted House of Ebenezer Scrooge and a play area called Fagin 's Den , resurrected the debate around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some writers accusing the owners of putting marketability over artistic integrity . <p> Mr Schweizer does not dispute that the three components -- Dickens , Britishness and the 19th century -- have become inseparable to some degree . Yet there is so much more at work in his novels aside from nostalgia , he says . The relevance lies in his description of the urban condition . The Dickens festival in the Netherlands is perhaps the biggest dedicated annual event , with 160,000 people attending , many in period costume . A large number choose to dress up as chimney sweeps and orphans , a reminder of the timeless nature of dispossession and social injustice . " He was one of the first people to write in an age of modernity as someone witnessing the speeding up of life and travel and communication . Dickens 's England is one we can relate to , " says Schweizer . <p> Werner offers the same explanation for his international appeal . " His London was the first city of the urban , industrial age and we are still living in that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are still poor housing conditions , there is still the red tape of Bleak House -- 1851 was the year of the Great Exhibition in London and Dickens wrote Bleak House as a counterpoint to that celebration . In it was also the debate around supporting charitable works in Africa when there was abject poverty on your doorstep . These big issues are still with us . <p> " Dickens is incredibly popular in a country like China , perhaps because they are going through a similar experience to 19th-century urban British cities in that the city is sucking people in from the countryside , breaking up the family , and leading people to want to rise up the social scale . " <p> Litt , meanwhile , can see why Dickens is big in America . " His characters take a very American trajectory -- they give you the idea that anyone can rise from the bottom and live the dream . " <p> What has been acknowledged as especially remarkable about Dickens 's fiction is the ease of its adaptability to film and stage . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that his stories have been kept alive , and made more commercial , through this medium . Television adaptations have followed at a steady flow over the decades . <p> In fact , it could be argued that Dickens 's readers are increasingly not readers at all , but cinema-goers whose favourite Dickensian memories are celluloid ones . Ever since the first adaptation of A Christmas Carol in 1902 , film-makers have identified all the markings of cinema language in his work , from montages to cliff-hangers to colourful dialogue to cinematic pace . Sergei Eisenstein , George Bernard Shaw , and DW Griffith contended that Dickens wrote in a cinematic language years before cinema . There is a clear cinematic quality to his description as chapters open with large , framing panoramic sweeps -- the widescreen shot -- and then home in on the particular -- a household , a character , a street . <p> Anthony Wall , the series editor of BBC 's arts strand Arena , has directed Dickens on Film , a documentary which makes a claim for Dickens as the progenitor of film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 15 December , and be broadcast on television in early January . Wall suggests it is the constant reinterpretation of Dickens on film that has given , and will continue to give , the writer his commercial longevity . <p> " Dickens lives on as strong as ever but that 's as much due to the success of cinema and television adaptations as it is to the book themselves . They 're there , unchanging forever , but their stay on film is a fascinating trip through the last 100 years . There 's every reason to suppose that will be true of the next 100 , " he says . <p> Just great : Best Dickens biographies <p> Not only meant for newcomers in Dickens 's world , but for seasoned travellers there , Claire Tomalin 's superb biography stands out as the best general passport issued this year : ' Charles Dickens : a Life ' ( Viking , ? 30 ) . <p> However , the bicentenary year has stocked the shelves with other top-drawer commemorations . Merging biography into criticism , Robert Douglas-Fairhurst , in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks why , and how , the hyperactive young pretender of the 1830s so suddenly won the superstar status that has never dimmed . In contrast , Dickens 's first biographer , John Forster , told the life as an almost predestined ascent to greatness . A sumptuous illustrated abridgement of Forster 's 1874 ' The Life of Charles Dickens ' ( Sterling , ? 30 ) includes a grand gallery of images . ' Charles Dickens ' by his great-great-great granddaughter Lucinda Dickens Hawksley ( Andre Deutsch , ? 30 ) is an evocative collection of documents ; worthwhile shorter books include ' Dickens 's Women ' by Anne Isba ( Continuum , ? 14.99 ) and Michael Slater 's ' The Genius of Dickens ' ( Duckworth , ? 10.99 ) . <p> BOYD TONKIN <p> David Nicholls : Why I adapted Dickens <p> " I grew up on the musical ' Oliver ' . That was my idea of Dickens . I must have been about 13 or 14 when I took a deep breath and got the rather intimidating book , and found it really engaging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was an extraordinary book that I could identify with very much . I found it engaging , exciting and very touching , even if I did n't understand all of it by any means . I skipped over some passages , but as a way into adult literature , it was perfect . There are lots of writers who have influenced me but certainly my love of adult literature was inspired by Dickens and George Orwell , to a certain extent . <p> ' Great Expectations ' is a book that has always stayed with me and of all the authors I love , Dickens has not really influenced my writing but he has stayed with me the longest . <p> I initially said no to adapting ' Great Expectations ' because the David Lean film cast a long shadow . <p> It was also my favourite novel , which was a reason to adapt it , and also a reason not to adapt it . You inevitably immerse yourself in a book when you are adapting . It can become over-familiar and you see its flaws . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I read it again and I was moved by it again . I also sat down to watch the David Lean film after a deep breath , as I had never actually seen it . It was terrific , but the bits it leaves out are not the bits I would leave out . Inevitably , you have to make choices when you adapt , and I felt there was enough material in the book that could justify taking another look at it . <p> I was pretty faithful to the text , but when you adapt , it is a combination of original work and the screenwriters ' view of the book . There are a lot of things that are reported in the novel that you will actually see this time around . <p> Like any Victorian novel , it contains a lot of exposition -- and within that , there are things that happen off stage , which can be put into a film . You see things in this film version that I have not seen in other adaptations , but it is still faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two that Dickens wrote , but it draws on something that is referred to in the book that is not usually seen on screen . <p> There is a strong thriller element to ' Great Expectations ' . There 's a sense towards the end of Pip as a kind of detective . He uncovers the intrigue of Estella 's origin and Miss Havisham 's past . Two thirds of the way into the book , when Magwitch returns , the tone changes to one of danger and secrets revealing themselves , and that 's certainly the case in the last third of the film version . <p> Adapting is more editorial than writing an original screenplay . It 's about what to keep in and what to lose . I found it creative and satisfying to write the screenplay for ' Great Expectations ' . It 's different from writing original material because Dickens has done the hard bit . He created Miss Havisham and Magwitch and structured this wonderful plot . That 's where the genius lies . <p> I read the book ten times before writing the screenplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made notes . I never found myself bored . It is incredibly consistent , with no longueurs or superfluous dialogue . I have always found it moving , even though Dickens is not necessarily celebrated as an emotional or romantic writer . It is touching and heartbreaking . In the end , adapting it did n't ruin my enjoyment of the book at all -- and I did n't fall out of love with it . <p> David Nicholls , who is also the author of the bestseller ' One Day ' , was speaking to Arifa Akbar . The new film of ' Great Expectations ' will be released next year
