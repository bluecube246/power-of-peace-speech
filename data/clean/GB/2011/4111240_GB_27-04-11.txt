William Craig  William Craig , who died on April 25 aged 86 , was the leader of the militant Ulster Vanguard movement and was Vanguard Unionist MP for East Belfast from 1973 to 1979 .  During the early years of direct rule in the province , Craig earned a reputation as a Protestant firebrand and launched his Vanguard Party in demagogic style , demanding a return to Protestant majority rule in Stormont and no " sell-out " to the Roman Catholic minority in the province .  William Craig  In 1974 Craig was the main organiser with the Rev Ian Paisley of the Loyalist strike which brought down the five-month-old power-sharing assembly on which the British government had pinned so much hope . Craig was regarded as the link with the paramilitary groups , the UDA and the UVF , which gave the strike its muscle .  But the next three years saw a dramatic shift in his position . In 1975 he split fellow Unionists over their refusal to continue talks over power sharing with the mainly Catholic SDLP . He condemned considerable effect behind the scenes to prevent the strike closing the crucial Ballylumford power station at Larne and to get Larne harbour reopened .  Craig 's change of heart won him little credit in the Unionist community and he promptly lost more than half his followers . After winding up Ulster Vanguard in 1978 , he won the Official Unionist nomination for his constituency , but was defeated at the 1979 general election by the Democratic Unionist Peter Robinson .  There was , though , an underlying consistency in Craig 's change of heart : unlike politicians such as Paisley , he had been prepared to negotiate with Roman Catholics provided they shared his belief that Northern Ireland could be governed effectively only by local politicians , either through independence or some form of devolution within the United Kingdom . A strong pro-European , he saw the German federal model as offering the best hope of a lasting solution .

After the war he studied Law at Queen 's University , Belfast , and was articled to a solicitors ' firm , qualifying in 1952 . With a bank loan he bought into a small practice at Lurgan .  In 1960 he was returned to the Stormont Parliament as Unionist member for Larne . Appointed chief whip in 1962 , he became Minister for Home Affairs in 1963 , Minister for Health and Local Government in 1964 , Minister for Development in 1965 and Minister for Home Affairs again in 1966 .  But as the Unionist leadership , under Captain Terence O'Neill , came under pressure from the British government to respond to Catholic demands for civil rights , Craig became increasingly outspoken in his opposition to any concessions .  His biggest political decision during this time was to ban the civil rights march in Londonderry in October 1968 because he believed it was a " Nationalist/Republican parade " . The march went ahead , but the police stopped it and proposals for constitutional reform , Craig was dismissed from the Cabinet in December 1968 .  He soon became the focus for grass roots opposition to the Unionist Party leadership , fomenting dissent among the party 's rank and file . After O'Neill 's resignation , he fought both James Chichester Clark and later Brian Faulkner for the Unionist leadership .  Craig 's rhetoric during this period became increasingly uncompromising . In 1969 he prophesied civil war if the government 's proposals to restructure the Ulster Special Constabulary were accepted ; as the prospect of direct rule came nearer , he called on the people of Northern Ireland to " use every means to defend their constitutional rights " .  After direct rule was imposed in 1972 , he resigned from the Unionist Party because it had accepted the government 's white paper proposals on power sharing . In October 1972 he survived an attack by a Provisional IRA gunman who fired at him while he was driving to his solicitors ' practice at Lurgan .  Soon afterwards he announced that he and his followers were prepared to British heritage .  Craig was the guiding light behind the revival of the Ulster Loyalist Association in 1969 which in 1972 became the Vanguard movement , a non-party association of Loyalist organisations committed to the preservation of the Northern Irish constitution . He gathered popular support in a series of rallies , telling his supporters that they should build up dossiers on the " enemies " of Northern Ireland " because one day , if our politicians fail , we will have to liquidate the enemy " .  Ulster Vanguard stayed inside the Unionist monolith until Stormont was prorogued and the Northern Ireland Assembly elections of 1973 , when it was converted into a party . By the time Craig entered Parliament at the February 1974 general election , however , he was beginning to have second thoughts .  As the province teetered on the brink of civil war , he began to recoil from the plans of Loyalist paramilitary groups to take control of the province and declare independence . He had also become convinced that some form of coalition with Catholics was the only way to 1975 he broke ranks with the United Ulster Unionist Coalition ( UUUC ) in the Northern Irish Constitutional Convention over its decision to break off power-sharing talks with the SDLP , and went on to offer the SDLP seats in a national emergency coalition . He had become convinced during the talks that the SDLP was " prepared to support the state of Northern Ireland as long as the state has the support of the majority " .  Craig 's volte-face was immediately attacked by his fellow Unionists , notably Ian Paisley and Enoch Powell . The following month , nine out of 13 Vanguard colleagues on the Constitutional Convention resigned , and Craig and his followers were expelled from the UUUC .  After losing his seat in the 1979 general election , in 1982 Craig stood unsuccessfully for election to the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole representative of a revived Vanguard Party .  Despite his erstwhile reputation as a rabble rouser , in private Craig was a humorous and tolerant man , able to get on with politicians of every political hue .
