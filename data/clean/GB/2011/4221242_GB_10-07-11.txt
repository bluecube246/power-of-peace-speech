<h> You are here : <h> Battle : Los Angeles - Den Of Geek goes on a military training day <h> To tie in with the home release of Battle : Los Angeles , we sent our roving adventurer Nick off on a military training day . Here 's what happened ... <p> Maybe it 's because I went to the last Den Of Geek quiz dressed in full combat fatigues , or perhaps it 's my ' I Heart Guns ' badge , but either way I found myself on the receiving end of a phone call inviting me to take part in an army training boot camp day to celebrate the launch of Battle : Los Angeles on DVD and Blu-ray . <p> Having survived , nay thrived , on similar excursions ( once dressing as a WWII Marine and another time as a Roman ) I thought , " Yeah , bring it on . I 'm the damn king of these sort of things . A quick dress up , breeze through some drills , play with a fake gun and then home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The first clue things were going to be different was the location , an abandoned warehouse complex somewhere south of London . A local taxi informed another journalist there that the place did n't really exist anymore . Ominous . Once there we were met by men wearing a lot of body armour and stroking guns . Ushered inside into the crumbling factory , we saw yet more guns , and more heavily tooled up guys . <p> It quickly transpired that a lot of them were ex-military or law enforcement , and our lead trainer for the day would be an actual soldier , known only as Dan ( as moonlighting for things like this is strictly frowned upon in the military ) . The aim of the day was to experience the exact boot camp conditions that the actors went through while preparing for the film . The timetable looked intense . Eight hours of becoming men ( and one woman ) . <p> We would receive basic weapons training and instruction with the Airsoft guns . For those unfamiliar with Airsoft , I can reliably inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead of paint pellets , you fire gas-powered plastic ball bearings at each other . <p> This means the guns and tactical situations you can be placed in are a hell of a lot more realistic , and are one of the reasons the real deal army guys prefer it . The bastard pellets also hurt a hell of a lot if you get hit with one , and can do some real damage , as evidenced by the smashed teeth of one of the instructors . <p> It was at about this point I wondered if I could sneak out the back and run for safety . <p> However , the only running I seemed to be doing was back and forth during our firing exercises . To say these so-called easy warm-up exercises were hardcore would be understating it . Panting for breath after every move and fire , it was only the threat of being shot in the nuts that kept me moving . And yes , that was a real threat . <p> Gradually , though , our small team of foppish , mincing media types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command in an instant , peeling right and left , move and covering , easy . <p> Having successfully bested basic training , we moved on to the more extreme special forces stuff , close quarters battle and dynamic entry . This involved working in our team of four to scout out a door to a potentially hostile room , then essentially breaking down the door and neutralising any threats inside . In real life this is an incredibly dangerous task , as the first person in is usually killed straight away by any hostiles inside . <p> To make the task as realistic as possible , the trainers posed as both hostages and terrorists , forcing us to either shoot them or rescue them , both usually with a degree of force . It also meant we got to legitimately kick in a door while waving a gun about and shouting , " Get down on the floor , motherfucker ! " It 's the stuff childhood dreams are made of . <p> Once Dan the army man was suitably impressed at our CQB skills , and our ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more serious stuff . This meant putting away our protective mesh goggles and donning full face masks . We looked mean , but my elephant t-shirt somewhat spoilt the effect . Still , eco-warriors are dangerous , yeah ? <p> Anyway , now it was time for what was scarily called pressure testing , where all our newfound killers skills would be put to the test under a pretty life-like scenario . <p> We had to rescue three hostages and escort them to safety , while potentially coming under attack . And without further ado , we were off , clearing rooms like we had learnt , one by one , until suddenly we were under attack ! And these pellets really sting when they hit . <p> But , no matter . We 'd found the hostages , shot the bad guys ( eventually , I had a slight hesitation when I found one hostage having a gun pointed at his head . I genuinely thought , " Can I really pull the trigger and kill a man ? " ) , and led our hostages out of there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb or I 'll shoot you in the bollocks . " I believe the SAS would consider that unorthodox . <p> Thinking that we 'd achieved our aims almost too easily , we led the hostages out to what we thought was safety , only to - boom - be nailed in an ambush . Smoke bombs and flash bangs went off , the team panicked and ran . None of us made the slightest bit of sense . ( Genuinely . Due to adrenalin 's effect on the brain , your higher functions , including language , suffer and you talk gibberish . That 's how real this simulation felt . ) <p> But somehow we muddled through and out the other side . But with only one hostage . The others had seemingly been killed in the mayhem . Oops . <p> As an insight into the film , a day like this is brilliant . Battle : Los Angeles wo n't be winning any awards for its script , but there 's no doubting it 's a genuinely excellent visceral experience . There 's a school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respond to the on-screen action with physical reactions . When it comes to a movie like this , I would have to genuinely agree , and knowing what the actors went through to prepare and then shoot the film , it adds to the thrill of watching aliens blowing a lot of shit up . <p> The guys who organised our day did a great job at recreating the tension and excitement of a real combat situation , and I would highly recommend trying it out if you 've ever had any impulse to play at war . However , be prepared for a tough day . After all that running about and diving to the floor I still ca n't really move my legs .
