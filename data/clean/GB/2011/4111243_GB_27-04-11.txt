" <p> Her village remains under threat from attacks by remaining members of the FRPI militia ( Forces for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri ) - the group formed by Mr Kakado and allegedly led by Gen Katanga . <p> The FRPI was one of the players in the ethnic conflict that flared up here 10 years ago . <p> Tens of thousands were killed , many by child soldiers or in cannibalistic rituals . <p> In June 2003 , a French-led European offensive stopped the massacres . <p> After three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national efforts to disarm the rest of Ituri 's rebel groups , which continue to this day . <h> ' Groups of bandits ' <p> " The militia is no longer organised in a military way , " said Col Fall Sikabwe , the Congolese army commander for operations in Ituri . <p> " We have been carrying out numerous combat operations and totally destabilised that insurgent organisation . They now operate as small groups of bandits . " <p> Media captionViolence is still simmering in the Ituri region following years of ethnic divisions <p> During a recent visit to Ituri , the UN 's deputy representative in DRC , Fidele Sarassoro , said that the rebels ' " operational capacity is virtually wiped out " . <p> Yet he admitted that the bands of remaining guerrillas " still represent a large threat to the population " . <p> " We are continuing joint operations with the Congolese army to finish off those groups , " he said . <p> But UN and Congolese forces alike are stretched over a vast territory and face competing demands from more active flashpoints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they clear an area of guerrillas , the police do not have enough resources to move in and maintain order . <p> On 20 April , gunmen killed two government soldiers in Aveba , just 40km ( 25 miles ) from Bukiringi . <p> According to the UN 's humanitarian coordination office , the number of rebel attacks against civilians in southern Ituri has been on the increase since February . <h> Grim limbo <p> Avezi Abezo , another of the 3,000 displaced people in Bukiringi said : " We do n't believe in the purpose of the militiamen . " <p> " Whatever their objective is , we only see them arrive somewhere to wreck havoc and destroy whatever community facilities the population was benefiting from . Up until now , we do n't know what their goal is . " <p> Image caption UN and Congolese troops are working together against the militias <p> Some local sources mention gold mines , but Ituri 's main deposits are further north , in areas free of rebel activity . <p> The area is caught in a grim limbo between war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are turning away from Ituri while those that fund development projects are not yet convinced of the necessity to move into Ituri because of the lack of stability in some areas and of generalised corruption in the region , " said Severine Ramis of the aid agency Save the Children . <p> Aid workers here say that what Ituri needs is long-term partnerships between government and international agencies to restore education , agriculture and economic networks , as well as a robust strategy to tackle land disputes that often plunge stabilised areas into fresh waves of violence . <p> But they add that what Ituri has been getting is mostly short-term assistance projects - and unrealistic expectations from its vast oil and gold deposits .
