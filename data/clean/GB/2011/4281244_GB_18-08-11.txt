<h> Positioning Venture in the Gulf of Guinea - 19/08/2011 <p> Watergate Technical Services based in Port Harcourt , Nigeria , purchased two Applied Acoustics ' Easytrak USBL tracking systems in 2010 and they quickly became a successful operational tool . <p> Prior to the purchase of the tracking system , diver positioning and tracking had been challenging during subsea riser and mattress installations during pipelaying projects . Once Easytrak was deployed , interfaced with GPS and gyro compass , precise positioning and heading determination of the diver and mattress installation frame became much easier . During a recent mattress-laying operation off Warri in the Gulf of Guinea , accuracy of less than one metre was achieved , even when working in a near-shallow environment . <p> The ability to interface the unit with a navigation computer also makes the operation free of ambiguity as the positioning information can be displayed at strategic offices as well as at the dive shack . This visible confirmation of operations underwater provides the client with all the necessary confidence in the accuracy and efficiency of the Watergate operation . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services such as pre-installation pipe route surveys , SEWOP positioning , site hazard surveys , subsea riser and mattress installations . Survey Manager , Ugo Nwangwu , maintains the Easytrak system with its 900 Series Beacons fitting perfectly in their deepwater survey operations in the Nigerian Gulf of Guinea and Bight of Bonny .
