alistair fraser offers an essential cultural guide to zagreb , a city with chic caf ? s , curious museums and a stunning cemetery .  old zagreb is so compact you can reach most of its cultural jewels on foot . numerous museums and galleries , plus dozens of caf ? s and restaurants , are just yards apart in the lower town -- a grid of handsome buildings and parks reflecting the city 's standing in the austro-hungarian empire -- and in the cobbled streets of the hilly upper town . but with so much choice in croatia 's capital you need to be selective .  many will feel compelled to visit mimara , the city 's famous art museum , but to me it is no different from many other great museums and i felt my time would be better spent at the museum of contemporary art . this striking building -- in the otherwise bleak new zagreb south of the river sava -- is best visited at night , when it 's lit by fantastic light shows .  if modernism 's , where among the narrow streets and magnificent buildings , you 'll find the museum of zagreb ( www.mdc.hr/mgz ) . i spent a couple of hours here absorbed in the city 's history , from the iron age and its growth as a trading centre to the turbulence of the communist era and the break-up of yugoslavia .  then i wandered past colourful st mark 's church to check out the zany museum of broken relationships ( www.brokenships.com ) . its collection of objects -- among them an axe , prosthetic leg and wedding dress -- has been donated by individuals . they 're all legacies of failed love affairs and many are accompanied by moving tales of broken hearts .  i felt like a drink after that , as my attic is stuffed with many such objects , so i cut across to tkalciceva , lined with coffee shops and bars , and found cica , a lively place where i joined the locals knocking back homemade rakija ( fruit-based brandies ) .  did you know ?  the fountain pen was invented by zagreb resident , i strolled around bogoviceva and preradoviceva square in the lower town , where seemingly everyone gathers at one of the many pavement caf ? s , especially bulldog xl . if you want to mix with the beautiful set , tiny but trendy eli 's caff ? and the hip velvet are the places to be .  for music , time your visit to coincide with one of the festivals -- in june there is c'est is d'best and croatia 's main event , inmusic , though live acts are easy to find year-round . among the best venues are the b p club ( teslina ) and bacchus ( trg kralja tomislava ) , a friendly jazz bar full of antique curios .  to blow away the cobwebs the following morning , i caught the 106 bus to visit mirogoj , the city 's beautifully landscaped main graveyard . its arcades , ivy-covered cupolas and church are stunning , as are many of the tombstone monuments , in an all-embracing cemetery where you 'll see catholic graves , cyrillic inscriptions of the orthodox church , islamic crescents stomp around zagreb , it was the perfect place to wind down .
