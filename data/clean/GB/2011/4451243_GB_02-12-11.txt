' tour ( Pic : Getty Images )  The people of Bournemouth are in for a treat tonight , providing they 've got themselves a ticket to the first night of The Saturdays tour anyway .  Here are the girls in rehearsals earlier today looking very festive in sexy Santa hooded cloaks ( Katie Price will be very jealous ) , very short shorts , kinky secretary outfits and neon , boob hugging mini-dresses .  Fans of the girl group will be relieved to see Frankie Sandford looks fit and healthy after being forced to take a break from the band due to be raring to go too , tweeting earlier : " On my way to Bournemouth with the rest of @TheSaturdays ! Im so excited ! ! ! I hope u guys are ready for a party ! ! ! ! "  Frankie 's bandmate Una Healy , who is currently pregnant , also appeared to have plenty of energy during the rehearsals and is n't letting the bump hold her back .
