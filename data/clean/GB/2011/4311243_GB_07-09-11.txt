football clubs may be forced to shortlist black managers  the professional footballers ' association ( pfa ) are investigating the possibility of forcing clubs to put black candidates on shortlists for managerial vacancies .  face in the crowd : chris hughton , the birmingham city manager , is just one of two black managers in the football leaguephoto : action images  by telegraph staff and agencies  4:51pm bst 07 sep 2011  since paul ince left notts county in april , only two of the 92 english league teams have black managers , chris powell at charlton and birmingham 's chris hughton .  discussions with the men who brought about the implementation of the ' rooney rule ' in the united states , that has promoted opportunity for black coaches in the league , are at an early stage , with further talks planned .  gordon taylor , the pfa chief executive , feels it is an avenue that has to be explored .  " in football terms , we are the most cosmopolitan country in the world , " , creed , nationality or background .  " however , the pfa spends a lot of money training players for the future and understandably , one of the most obvious areas of interest is coaching and management . for some reason the number of black people who actually get a chance in this area is very small .

" all we are asking for is an interview , " he said .  " but the more times eventually getting a job .  " this has to be a good thing because it broadens panel of potential managers and coaches clubs are selecting from and opens up the possibility of greater experience .  " that should be what every club is looking for anyway . "  invited by taylor , mehri met members of the pfa , league managers ' association , the football association , football league and premier league at wembley on tuesday , ahead of england 's victory over wales .  " we are committed to this issue and cyrus ' experiences can offer us an insight and some solutions that can begin to address a concern that will not go away on its own , " said taylor .  " twenty years ago , cyrille regis and luther blissett did not try to carve out a career in management because they did not feel they would get a proper chance .  " in 2011 , it is in no-one 's interests for potential managers to be put off for similar reasons . we will not be taking this off @ @ @ @
