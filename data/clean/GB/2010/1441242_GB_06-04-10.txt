Taking Twitter's political temperature

The 2010 vote is also the first time politicians and their strategy teams have had to factor in the micro-blogging site Twitter.com . The social media tool , which did not exist at the time of the last election in 2005 , now has over 75 million users who between them sent four billion tweets in the first quarter of 2010 .  It is also home to a vibrant -- and often vitriolic -- political community that is certain to go into overdrive in the run-up to polling day and beyond .  But whose side are they on ?  To answer this question , Reuters commissioned market research company Crimson Hexagon to conduct a detailed assessment of opinions expressed by the UK public about the political parties on Twitter .  Archiving all tweets related to the parties and their leading figures and then analysing them for positive and negative sentiment ( while simultaneously filtering out any tweets which expressed no opinion ) , the research team was able to take the political temperature of British Twitter users .  The results make for the percentage of positive tweets for Labour , Conservatives , Lib Dems and other parties between March 22 and April 5 . The Conservative Party scores slightly better than its rivals ; over the entire period 13 percent of tweets were pro-Tory , compared with 10 percent pro-Labour , 8 percent pro-Lib Dems and 8 percent for other parties .  Unfortunately for Tory leader David Cameron , it 's downhill from here . This next graph , showing negative tweets for each party during the same period , shows a big gap between anti-sentiment for the Conservatives and the other parties ( an average of 28 percent anti-Tory , 18 percent anti-Labour , 7 percent anti-Lib Dems and 8 percent for the other parties ) .  The final graph shows the net results for each party and confirms that anti-Tory sentiment was constant throughout this period .  Edward Schneider , a consultant at Crimson Hexagon , said : " Twitter reveals the Tories to be the most talked about , as well as the most polarising , party in recent weeks . Over 40 percent of Twitter conversation the Conservative Party , compared to only 28% for Labour .  " However , much of the gap in volume is comprised of negative tweets -- the Conservative Party has only a 3 percentage point lead on Labour in terms of favourable tweets .  " It 's worth noting that Twitter support for the Liberal Democrats and other parties , particularly UKIP , does not lag far behind , and in aggregate terms it actually surpasses both the leading parties . The possibility of a hung parliament is unquestionably alive , at least online . "  Over the coming weeks we will update this information to provide you with a real-time view of what the UK Twitter community truly thinks about the main political parties .  Twitter is great for following certain people or laundry lists at once , but to enable deeper insights and analysis we created a side-by-side comparison site , Politwecal , at http : //www.politwecal.com .
