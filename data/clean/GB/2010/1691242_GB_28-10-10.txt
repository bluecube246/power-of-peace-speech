The singer has resurrected the name Band of Joy from the pre-Led Zep Midlands blues outfit he formed with drummer John Bonham in the 60s , but last night 's sell-out concert was way more than just the blues .  Instead the hall rang out with the sounds of his other musical love , American roots music -- from rockabilly to soul , gospel to country and bluegrass to rock , Plant 's inimitable vocals floating over the top .  " Welcome to another peculiar evening with the Band Of Joy , " he smiled , looking around the venue and adding " Do n't be intimidated by the environment . "  The sound throughout was stunning , with Angel Dance featuring a spellbinding five-part vocal harmony , something which was to be repeated to great effect throughout the night .  Plant showed he is still the master of pulling rock star shapes . . . he invented many of them , after all .  House Of Cards was awe-inspiring , while Please Read The Letter , from his Grammy Award-winning Raising , darker edge live , this time with Patty Griffin sharing vocal duties .  Plant recalled going to various blues gigs in the 60s at Birmingham Town Hall , particularly Blind Gary Davies , whose Twelve Gates To The City he then sang .  The star , smiling and genial throughout , was even happy to step to the back of the stage and provide backing vocals on three occasions to let Griffin and guitarists Buddy Miller , and Darrell Scott take over lead vocals and a well-deserved share of the limelight .  And then there were , of course , the Led Zep " covers " , complete reinventions of songs like Misty Mountain Hop , Houses Of The Holy , Gallows Pole and Rock &amp; Roll that saw a battery of instruments from mandolin , banjo , pedal steel guitar , double bass and washboard paint familiar classics in whole new colours , the effect both eerie and mesmerising in turn .  The evening ended with just the voices of all six band members entwining for And We Bid You Goodnight and , after an did .  Paul Merrett  October 28 , 2010 4:07 pm  OK lets have a reality check eh . For starters he did nt get to grips with the venue till quite late in the set and I think he was the one who was a little awed by the venue for a while - compare his energy , approach etc to that of Jeff Beck who performed the same venue only a week or so ago - He took the audience for granted , ambled through a set that is clearly designed to meet an american audinces needs and , like Dylan , Van Morrisson and a few others of that generation is in danger of starting to trade on " Brand Plant " to enhance his pension . Now before you shoot the messenger I have been following him since day one and for stand out quality I reference his set at Wolverhampton Civic Hall in December 2005 which was a masterclass into how to mix old and new with re-worked versions.I welcome class acts evolving and maturing and thats clearly what he s doing , but his best , good yes can do better .
