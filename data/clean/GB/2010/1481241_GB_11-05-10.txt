<h> Holidaymakers face summer of chaos with BA strikes and continued ash cloud disruption <p> The holiday season may be almost upon us but travellers could be forgiven for being hesitant when booking a last-minute foreign trip this summer . <p> British Airways cabin crew last night announced 20 days of fresh strikes in the coming weeks and today dozens more flights across Europe were cancelled as the volcanic ash cloud continued to wreak havoc . <p> Plans by fans to fly to the World Cup could be affected by the BA strikes . The tournament begins on June 11 and thousands of England supporters have booked flights . <p> Grounded : British Airways ' crew are to hold 20 days of strikes in a long-running industrial dispute over pay and working conditions - just in time for the holidays <p> Dense:The cloud of ash and steam continues to emit from Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano , as shown by NASA 's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on board the Aqua satellite .

That offer remains available . <p> ' We are confident that many crew will again ignore Unite 's pointless strike call and support the efforts of the rest of the airline to keep our customers flying . ' <p> Unite is also planning a further ballot over other complaints : the removal of free and cheap flights perks from strikers and disciplinary action taken against 55 BA staff , including five sackings . <p> Today it urged cabin crew to challenge deductions from their pay during strikes in March , claiming that some cabin crew had wages deducted for days when they were not taking action . <p> Some crew have received back pay after contacting BA to complain about deductions , according to Unite . <p> Unite 's joint general secretaries Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley said : ' There can be no industrial peace without meaningful negotiations and while management victimises trade unionists and uses disciplinary procedures in a witch-hunt .
