<h> From Alan Ball to David Beckham - football boots most horrific designs <p> After the unveiling of Cristiano Ronaldo 's new boots , one thing for sure is Nike 's new design is not one for the purists and is perhaps for those with an acquired taste . <p> With football boots taking yet another wacky turn , Sportsmail looks back on some of the more disastrous footwear to grace the game . <p> Time gap : From Alan Ball in the seventies to John Barnes in the nineties , white boots took a while to fully catch on <h> The original white boots <p> Hummel were the first to break the taboo around boot colour when they released their white boot in the early 1970 's . <p> They never really caught on until all sorts of colours ( almost overnight ) became acceptable in the mid-90s , by then Adidas and Puma had a big stranglehold on the market . <p> Full of colour : But Fila 's rainbow coloured boots did not prove popular <h> Fila 's ' rainbow ' boots <p> Quite possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very rare of anyone ever playing in these . <p> On the positive side if one of your teammates happened to be colour blind and purchased a pair you would not miss him for a pass from a mile away . <p> Think pink : Bendtner found no problems finding the back of the net with his pink boots <h> Nike Mercurial Rosa <p> Exactly why Nicklas Bendtner thought wearing a pair of bright pink coloured boots was a good idea will for now remain a mystery . <p> Chances are if you turned up to your local Sunday League game flashing a pair of shiny ' in your face pink ' boots you would have a few more lumps kicked out of you than usual . <p> Retro : The boot is a tribute to Italian World Cup winning boss Vittorio Pozzo <h> Puma FG Italia <p> With Nike pushing the final boundary on colours with their ' Rosa ' boots and Fila just about using every colour going , Puma decided to go the other way with their FG Italia . <p> Their brown number only needs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the added dashes of blue turn it in to a mess and make it only acceptable to wear if you happen to play for the Corinthian Casuals . <p> Practicable ? Kelme 's boot is made with Swarovski crystals <h> Kelme Swarovski <p> Taking boots where no boots have gone before , in exchange for 350 of your hard earned pounds you get a pair of football boots ... laced with crystals . <p> The performance advantage ? None . The chance you will have even more lumps kicked out of you than if you wore the ' Rosa ' ? Loads . <p> Golden shoes : Beckham 's boots were to celebrate his 100th England cap <h> Beckham 's golden ton <p> No debate on football boots can be complete without at least a brief mention about David Beckham . <p> In this case it 's those gold boots he wore on his 100th cap against France . To wear gold you have to at least back it with a performance on the pitch . Beckham was sadly anonymous in a 1-0 defeat .
