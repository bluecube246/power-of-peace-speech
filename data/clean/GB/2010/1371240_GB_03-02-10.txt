http://www.telegraph.co.uk/active/7139089/The-best-of-British-10ks.html

<h> The 10km run is the ideal distance - here are some of the nation 's finest . <p> Short enough to whizz through in an afternoon , long enough to offer a lifetime 's satisfaction , the 10km is probably the greatest distance any weekend runner can attempt . It is a challenge everyone faces on their own terms , with endless rewards . Elite or beginner , the events listed here are worthy of any athlete 's race diary this year . <p> 1 CITY OF LINCOLN 10K <p> A fine race past the medieval sights of Lincoln that is admired by elite runners , yet is flat enough for beginners , too . Feel the spirit as you fly past the 900-year-old cathedral , then sprint for a finishing line just the other side of the castle gates . <p> No , " Wright Hassall " is not a badly spelt indication of organisational chaos , it 's the sponsor 's name . This run through Leamington Spa 's parks is scenic and ideal for all skill levels . There 's a ? 100 first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3km is eased by a downhill romp 2km later <p> Probably the biggest women-only 10km run in Britain , it attracts up to 13,000 for sweat and high jinks . What makes this race through three south-west Glasgow parks truly wonderful is not size , but an atmosphere bordering on the joyous . <p> Star point : The route includes Pollok Country Park , voted best in Europe <p> You like history ? Please walk this way , or more sensibly run . This course tears through Britain 's historic heartland , including Westminster Abbey , the Houses of Parliament , Big Ben , Horse Guards Avenue and The Mall . Also , it 's likely to be part of the route of the 2012 Olympic marathon . <p> Run with real beasts . This three-lap circuit of Whipsnade Zoo takes you past wild animal enclosures where you 'll spot lumbering rhinos , flapping flamingos and antelopes so fleet they 'll make even the fastest runner blush . Entry allows you to stay all day in this Bedfordshire hot spot . <p> Star point : This race , now in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You might stumble over the name but the course is over an incredibly smooth cycle-route , with marvellous seagoing Gower Peninsular views all the way . A carnival atmosphere with entertainment ( and runs ) for kids , too . Also ideal for wheelchair competitors . <p> Star point : Think of this race as a fantastic day out with unparalleled views . <p> The Machen 10K will test you with a 1,000ft climb up South Wales 's hillsides . The reward at the top is a literally staggering view to the Brecon Beacons and beyond , good enough to bring tears to your eyes -- if you 're not weeping already . <p> Star point : It 's all in the mind -- believe you 'll get to the top and you will <p> Brighton rocks when 3,000 runners stream into the city for this annual celebration of fitness . The course runs along the seafront so it 's flat , there 's masses of atmosphere and it 's one of the fastest in Britain ; last year 's winner notched a scary 29 minutes , four seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @
