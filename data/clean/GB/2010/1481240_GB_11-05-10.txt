Turkey 's opposition leader quits over sex video  The veteran leader of Turkey 's main secular opposition party resigned yesterday , saying he was the victim of a conspiracy following the release of a videotape on the internet purporting to show him and a woman in a bedroom .  The resignation of Deniz Baykal , a fierce critic of the ruling Islamist-leaning AK Party , comes as his Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) has pledged to block a referendum on constitutional reforms .  Mr Baykal accused the AK Party of having knowledge of the videotape . " This kind of illegal activity carried out on the leader of the main opposition party could not have been done without the knowledge of the government , " Mr Baykal said . The government of the Prime Minister , Tayyip Erdogan , is preparing to call a referendum on constitutional reforms to overhaul the judiciary and make the army answerable to civilian courts , changes he says are needed to meet European Union entry demands . Secularist critics say the reforms are an attempt by state and undermine Turkey 's secularist constitution .  The videotape shows a man who looks like Mr Baykal in his underwear getting dressed in a bedroom with a woman who also appears half-naked.
