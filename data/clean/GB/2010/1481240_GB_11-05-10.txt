turkey 's opposition leader quits over sex video  the veteran leader of turkey 's main secular opposition party resigned yesterday , saying he was the victim of a conspiracy following the release of a videotape on the internet purporting to show him and a woman in a bedroom .  the resignation of deniz baykal , a fierce critic of the ruling islamist-leaning ak party , comes as his republican people 's party ( chp ) has pledged to block a referendum on constitutional reforms .  mr baykal accused the ak party of having knowledge of the videotape . " this kind of illegal activity carried out on the leader of the main opposition party could not have been done without the knowledge of the government , " mr baykal said . the government of the prime minister , tayyip erdogan , is preparing to call a referendum on constitutional reforms to overhaul the judiciary and make the army answerable to civilian courts , changes he says are needed to meet european union entry demands . secularist critics say the reforms are an attempt by state and undermine turkey 's secularist constitution .  the videotape shows a man who looks like mr baykal in his underwear getting dressed in a bedroom with a woman who also appears half-naked.
