Fate of farmer 's hidden castle is sealed  He huffed and he puffed , but a farmer will still have to knock his house down , a court has ruled .  Surrey farmer Robert Fidler suspected he may not receive planning permission for a mock Tudor castle built on his land in Salford , near Redhill . So hoping to capitalise on a legal loophole , he constructed it hidden behind bales of straw and a tarpaulin , and has lived in it for four years , all the while leaving Reigate and Banstead council in the dark over its existence . But yesterday he lost a High Court battle to prevent its demolition .  Mr Fidler , 61 , built the luxury four-bedroom property , complete with ramparts , turrets and cannon , over two years , and lived in it with his wife and son . He hoped to sidestep the planning system by applying for a certificate of lawfulness , sometimes applicable if no one objects to a newly built property for four years after construction . He kept the property 2006 . When Mr Fidler removed the bales he believed the structure would no longer be subject to planning enforcement .  But Reigate and Banstead council issued an enforcement notice in March 2007 requiring the castle 's demolition on grounds he had erected it without planning permission .  The High Court was asked to decide whether the removal of the straw bales and tarpaulin was , in the eyes of the law , part of the building operation .  Deputy High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes said : " In my view , the inspector 's findings of fact make it abundantly clear that the erection/ removal of the straw bales was an integral -- indeed an essential -- fundamentally related part of the building operations that were intended to deceive the local planning authority and to achieve by deception lawful status for a dwelling built in breach of planning control . "  Mr Fidler still claims the castle is not illegal despite the ruling and pledged to take his fight to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary . He said : " This house house that has been lovingly created . I will do whatever it takes to keep it . "  The property includes a kitchen , living room , study , shower room and toilet and separate WC .  On the first floor , there are four bedrooms and another room still being fitted as a bathroom .  After the hearing Mr Fidler 's solicitor , Pritpal Singh Swarn , said an appeal was being considered : " The judge appears to have left open the big question -- when is a building substantially complete ? It is necessary for the courts to draw the line as to what constitutes a completed development . "
