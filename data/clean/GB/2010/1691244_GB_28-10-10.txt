New York Week: A Guide to Brooklyn's DIY Scene

Until recently , university-aged indie rock fans in New York City have n't had a lot of options . In a city that boasts dozens of clubs and venues , many under the age of 21 have been shut out of shows .  The drinking age in America was set nationally at 21 in 1984 . The state of New York leaves it up to the discretion of club owners whether or not they include the underagers , as club owners would have to purchase specific insurance policies to cover the under-21 crowd , and could have their liquor licenses thrown into jeopardy if undercover cops were to bust underage drinkers , they have little incentive to be inclusive . This has been a major motivating factor for the DIY scene that has sprouted in Brooklyn over the last ten years .  " People think that we 're just trying to have the most wild illegal sort of party ever or something , which is often kind of sad because that 's not what we 're going for , " says Todd Patrick , better since 2001 . He is perhaps New York 's best known indie promoter , having booked such bands as No Age , the Thermals , and the Fall in spaces ranging from his own venues to Polish night clubs to the high-ceilinged space above an auto body shop . " Not that having a fun party is n't also good , but that 's not why we do it . We do it because we want the musicians to be able to play in front of young people who are legally barred from seeing them . "  The So So Glos have experienced this conundrum from both sides of the stage . Brothers Ryan and Alex Levine and their step-brother Zach Staggers grew up in Bay Ridge , Brooklyn , and were joined by guitarist Matt Elkin in 2007 . The band found themselves sneaking underage friends through the back doors of Lower East Side clubs . They were additionally frustrated by the system of paying bands based on a tally of who came to see them , and , in Ryan 's words , " playing shows booked by there . "  The band began playing shows in the back rooms and basements of bars . Some of these shows were booked with the help of Joe Ahearn , who now runs the DIY venue Silent Barn as well as overseeing ( with Todd P ) the production of Showpaper , a 10,000 run bi-weekly newspaper listing all-ages shows in the greater New York area that cost less than $25 .  While on tour in the US in 2007 , the So So Glos decided they wanted to run their own DIY venue . " Seeing art spaces , meeting all these great people , we felt we had to reciprocate , " says Alex .  " What we saw on our first tour in America inspired us to do bigger things here , " says Matt . Bigger is the operative word : When they had returned from tour , Joe Ahearn was ready to show them what would become the Market Hotel . At 300 capacity , it 's the largest venue of its kind in Brooklyn .  Incidentally , Todd P had been point , as he was with other potential show spaces , but had not been able to get in touch with the landlords . " The So So Glos ... called the number and magically got someone to answer the phone , " he says . " And so they went and saw it and came to me and said , ' do you want to be involved ? ' and I said , ' of course . ' "  The So So Glos are no longer directly involved in Market Hotel ; in May 2009 , they opened Shea Stadium in conjunction with producer Adam Reisch . The converted warehouse space serves as a live room and recording studio , and Reisch records every live set , allowing bands to come away with a " Live at Shea Stadium " tape .  The Market Hotel , meanwhile , is currently dark . After a police raid in April 2010 , the space needs to have various improvements made in order to meet various standards and qualify for the necessary permits to reopen .  Many of the DIY spaces are actually people 's homes , loft spaces and larger apartments that have the furniture shoved out of the way for bands to play . Some are commercial spaces the landlords rent knowing they will be used as " performance spaces " and that some of the artists will be bands . That does not necessarily qualify the venue to charge for admission or sell alcohol . It is also an open secret that some of the commercially zoned spaces are lived in , though the landlords are n't amongst those in on the secret .  " Your neighbors and the local police precinct are the biggest things you have to watch out for , " says Bill Dozer , whose space , the Acheron , opened in May 2010 . " The cops generally do n't bother you because they have bigger things to worry about , " he says . " Keep the face of your business clean . " The Acheron , Shea Stadium , and Silent Barn are all in commercial or industrial areas ; with residential neighbours few and far between , there is Market Hotel , though parallel to an elevated Subway station , is in a high traffic commercial area , with cornershops and bars that are open well into the night . The circumstances encourage a police presence more so than shuttered warehouses .  Bill sees how spaces like the Acheron can create something permanent . Recalling shows at the residential McKibbin and Johnson loft complexes in the nebulous area called East Williamsburg , the schedules would have to be sporadic because of the neighbors . With this in mind , he is quick to emphasise the importance of running a DIY venue with the same professionalism as a commercial venue . " Make sure shows start and end at the same time . Make sure the bathroom is fucking clean , " he says with a laugh . " When you 're working at a show the first thing is that you 're at work . "  The future of DIY venues in Brooklyn could be shaped by the progress of the Market Hotel Project , the vehicle for getting the space up to code and securing its non-profit venue in the city to accomplish this -- former punk squat ABC No Rio on the Lower East Side has non-profit status , as does ISSUE Project Room , an art and performance space in Brooklyn that caters to avant garde tastes . Both venues have acquired million-dollar grants from the city . Non-profit status would help protect the Market Hotel against sky-rocketing NYC rent prices , and hopefully create a lasting community space .  " The idea of sustainability is really the issue here , " says Todd . " That anyone can use at a low cost , that other promoters and organizers can come in ... it will not be mine then , it will be run by a board , and hopefully served by and serving the community . So trying to create a framework that makes it easier for folks to keep this going after we step out . "  If there is a competition of **28;374;TOOLONG , within the scene there is less competition and more community . In addition to the listings in Showpaper , Todd P offers a comprehensive list of shows on his website . Recognising the attention he gets as a promoter , he is also keen to those who were already booking shows when he first moved to New York . Russ Waterhouse , lately of the Philadelphia band Blues Control , and visual artist Kyle Lapidus of the duo Lovid were both booking shows in the early 2000s , as was John Fitzgerald who started the Mighty Robot space ( now Secret Project Robot , and where Todd P 's Monster Island Basement is located ) , who Todd P cites as " the one who got the idea of these things , of good shows happening in Williamsburg . Previous to that , there were shows happening in Williamsburg , but they were , yeah , whatever . He started doing the great stuff . "  Bill Dozer , who currently plays with Attake , and the So So Glos , has recently completed a US tour with Matt and Kim , have learned first hand what to expect as a band and what to offer touring bands . Bill , for example , uses outside Acheron , is very clear with bands about what money is being taken off the door . " If the bands are happy with the show , it 's us , " he says . " If they 're happy or unhappy with the way they 're paid , that 's the promoter . "  Todd P remains adamant that anyone could throw a show , and makes no illusions of the simplicity of the process . " If people see us setting up , they see how set-up is done . And they realize sort of how unpretentious and uncomplicated it is , " he says . " And I do n't mean that our stuff is uncomplicated , I mean that all set-ups are uncomplicated . "  The So So Glos maintain that bands should n't be discouraged if they ca n't get a show at the increasingly popular Shea Stadium . They hope to see more venues in a similar vein . " The more places there are like this , the more shows , " is Matt 's logical opinion .  " If you show , " is Zach 's advice . " It 'll keep going on , and it should go on . "
