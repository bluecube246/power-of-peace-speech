simon schama , the new government adviser on history teaching , tells sameer rahim why children need a return to chronology  nothing can dampen simon schama 's enthusiasm for telling stories -- not even being caught in a south indian rainstorm . when i meet him at the week hay festival in kerala , his white , indian-style shirt is soaked and his greying hair is dripping . but the 65-year-old professor of history and art history at columbia university can not wait to defend his latest project .  when michael gove , the education secretary , appointed him in october as a government adviser on history teaching in schools , the criticism from some was scathing . mary beard , the cambridge classicist , said schama was " not only glitzy , but also cheap " and his new role was " an insult to history teachers " .  while many others , not least the millions of people who have enjoyed his television shows and bought his critically-acclaimed books , were no doubt delighted that he would be helping to sort out a rather unfortunate label .  " the history tsar thing is a ridiculous title made up by another newspaper , " says schama .  " i do n't want to offend any teachers whose work i respect so much and who labour heroically under very difficult circumstances -- especially in comprehensives .  " if anything i just want to be the echo of things i 've heard from them . " none the less he wrote ( with typical rhetorical brio ) last week of his worry that unless schoolchildren " can be won to history , their imagination will be held hostage in the cage of eternal now : the flickering instant that 's gone as soon as it has arrived " .  this is a lesson he has certainly managed to pass on in his own family . earlier this year schama 's daughter , chloe , had her first book published . wild romance is a scandalous story of victorian bigamy .  i ask whether he was more nervous when her book came out than when his own collection of essays , scribble  " yes absolutely . i was afraid people would want to get at me through her , " he says . " the press were total gents : they were enthusiastic and judged the book in its own right . "  he adds , with touching pride , that the book has been shortlisted for the longman-history today prize .  schama hopes to spread his family 's love of storytelling to every child in britain . he claims that the current method of teaching history -- focusing on the same few disconnected eras : the tudors , the industrial revolution , the first world war -- threatens to cut " the cord of our national memory " . expanding on that position , he says : " i am strongly of the opinion that chronology is very important . the great arc of time is what children are wired for . "  they love reading jk rowling and philip pullman because " the conceptual apparatus children have is for the epic " , he adds .  i ask him whether there is a role in schools , author of the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire . at first schama seems unsure that students in " sunderland or cardiff " would take to 18th-century orotund irony .  but , being schama , he starts to convince himself . " you could take one page , the life of mohammed , for example -- a rather over-heroic view of mohammed , but very interesting . " he seems decided : " i could do an afternoon of gibbon with 12 year-olds " . i say i have detected a gibbon-like ambition in his work . he looks a little -- but only a little -- uncomfortable with the comparison .  esdlqpatriots and liberators schama 's first book , a history of the netherlands from 1780 -- 1813 suffered from gibbonitis . i think it won the odd prize , but looking back on it i ca n't read it : those rolling cadences and overlong sentences are just embarrassing now . "  here in india the decline and fall of the british empire is clearly on his mind . in his , schama included what he delicately called " the indian moment " .  " we 've got all kinds of things to be ashamed of but we have things to celebrate too , " he tells me . " that this story matters seems to be unarguable . why would kids of asian background not want to know about the age of empire ? "  well , i say , might it not be awkward in a multiracial classroom to discuss both the crimes and achievements of the empire ? " history is admirably dangerous . it is not the soft option , " he replies robustly . " teachers need to be grown up and brave . sensitivity is fine but it stops at the door of honest narrative . "  other historians , notably david starkey , would prefer to stress the benevolence of the british empire . in a piece published this week questioning schama 's role as history adviser , starkey said students should study " how our liberal constitution based on responsible government was adopted worldwide " . just as schama and i of the hay festival , whose global media partner is the daily telegraph , interrupts us with news that aung san suu kyi , the burmese pro-democracy leader , has been released from house arrest . " oh it 's fantastic , " says schama . " we should drink her health tonight at dinner . a wonderful , wonderful moment . "  burma was under british rule from 1824 to 1948 and , save for a brief window of democracy , has been ruled by a military junta since independence . suu kyi 's story reminds us that britain 's past is inextricable from present conflicts .  university teaching is not part of schama 's government remit but he must , i ask , surely have an opinion on the proposed rise in student tuition fees . he answers carefully , perhaps restrained by the thought of his new boss , mr gove .  " all i would say about that is i 'm quite glad that the full browne report -- with no cap on tuition fees whatsoever -- does n't seem to have been adopted is young men and women only choosing subjects that will help them pay off their debt . " history is not usually one of those subjects .  the tradition in america , where schama has taught for 30 years , first at harvard and then at columbia , is very different . along with a culture of self-reliance , there are philanthropic donations and plenty of scholarships for poor students . schama clearly loves america . at the end of his 2008 book the american future , he wrote that the nation was in " strong , young , hardworking hands " . now he seems less sure . at an event the next day , the indian audience was treated to schama at full throttle .  once an admirer of obama 's " staggering composure and relaxed cool " , he now believes the president 's terrible midterm election results came from his failure to communicate the severity of the financial crisis . " the problem is no story was told to say how close we were to wipeout , " he says , wandering from the stage 's passivity in the face of attacks from the tea party campaign frustrates schama : " he 's an intellectual aristocrat who needs to talk to the doughnut lovers -- or he 's screwed . "  back in england , news of the engagement of prince william and kate middleton cheered up the man many would claim as our national historian . yet he had some words of warning for the couple and our expectations of them .  " we ask the royal family to do two things which are really difficult to put together . to be a cheer-up panacea for our tough times , an emblem of britishness , optimism and the community coming together . and we also just want them to be a loving couple . "  those two narratives , schama implies , are in danger of clouding and confusing each other . and if anyone knows the value of getting your story straight -- whether it 's reconnecting children with epic history , or showing us how obama has lost the plot -- it is schama.
