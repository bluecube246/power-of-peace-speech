Graphic Novel: Heart of Darkness

graphic novel : heart of darkness  i 've always had trouble with marlon brando 's performance in apocalypse now ; his kurtz is far from conrad 's bed ridden , emaciated ivory dealer . this depiction offers a more than fitting visual interpretation of kurtz , with his universe-encompassing stare depicted in a manner that live action will never manage .  this is a hyper-reality that the illustrator catherine anyango capitalizes on , the paradox that sometimes illustration is the best way to depict real life . the literal animation of inanimate objects is rendered beautifully , the " carcass " of an old steam engine being a perfect example . the frequent depiction of events from a bird 's eye view give a sense of two-dimensional progression along a map and the landscapes seen from this perspective often take on the appearance of some great animal 's skin . the pareidolia found in the original work is also a strong feature of the graphic novel , so strong as to reverse itself at times : faces found in scenery turn into scenery found in and white , though a sort of sepia black and white , not the boldness of persepolis . the illustration is done in pencil , though often crossing into inky territory , where bold smudges are reminiscent of cartographical inkblots or violent blood splatter . intense charcoal portraiture and sketch is used alongside this ; the former being one of the novels most effective illustrative skills . it should n't escape our attention that the narrator , marlowe , is given conrad 's own countenance .  in written style the graphic novel is just as brief as the book . in place of broad dialogues , individual lines are singled out and placed on a pedestal of dramatic image . undoubtedly a vast part of heart of darkness ' literary beauty is forgone , but this is inevitable in such a densely poetic novel and can be forgiven . the lines that have been chosen remain powerful , particularly alongside highly charged pictures ; in this way , conrad 's literary beauty is left intact and in charge .
