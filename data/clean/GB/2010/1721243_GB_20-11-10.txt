IMF's Dominique Strauss-Kahn wants fiscal and reform powers ...

Warning that " the sovereign crisis is not over " , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the IMF managing director and a likely French presidential candidate , called on the European Union to move responsibility for fiscal discipline and structural reform to a central body that is free from the influences of member states .  The proposal from so powerful a figure will dismay Ireland and other peripheral euro-zone nations already fearful of a loss of sovereignty as the price of a bail-out . Ireland is expected to agree a rescue of up to ? 100bn ( ? 85bn ) within days , in the form of a low-cost loan to shore up the banks .  The scale of Ireland 's problems was laid bare on Friday by Allied Irish Banks , which revealed that it has lost ? 13bn of customer deposits -- mostly " institutional and corporate " -- since the start of the year , 17pc of its entire deposit base .  Its reliance on funding from " monetary authorities " has risen to ? 27bn from a " high single-digit " billions Allied now has just ? 11bn of acceptable collateral left to pledge to institutions like the European Central Bank .  Allied 's numbers sent a fresh wave of panic through the markets , pushing Irish bond yields higher and erasing some of the euro 's earlier gains .  Irish 10-year bond yields rose three basis points to 8.34pc and the euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.3652 . George Papaconstantinou , Greece 's finance minister , added the bleak warning : " Even if Ireland is helped , it can not prevent the debt crisis from continuing . "  Allied also abandoned plans to sell its UK arm due to the " challenging market conditions " and increased its planned capital raising this year from ? 5.4bn to ? 6.6bn .  Mr Strauss-Kahn 's call to centralise power in Europe is significant because the IMF will contribute a large portion of the Irish rescue . In a speech in Frankfurt , he said : " The wheels of co-operation move too slowly . The centre must seize the initiative in all areas key to reaching , economic and social policy . Countries must be willing to cede more authority to the centre .  Referring to the crisis , he said : " The eurozone area 's institutions were simply not up to the task -- even setting up a temporary solution proved to be a drawn-out process . " One solution is to shift the main responsibility for enforcement of fiscal discipline and key structural reforms away from the Council . This would minimise the risk of narrow national interests interfering with effective implementation of the common rules . "  In proposals that are likely to play into the hands of eurosceptics in the UK and elsewhere , Mr Strauss-Kahn recommended more tax harmonisation and a larger central budget for the euro area . He said that labour market reforms need to be centralised , saying : " It is time to create a level playing field for European workers , especially in the area of labour taxation , social benefits systems and portability , and employment protection legislation .
