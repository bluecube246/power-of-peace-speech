<h> Victim Support Barnet services move out of Finchley offices <p> CHARITY bosses have insisted the relocation of support staff from their offices in Finchley will not have a detrimental impact on services for victims of crime in the borough . <p> Senior managers and administrative staff at Victim Support Barnet last week moved out of Avenue House , in East End Road , to offices in Brent , as part of cost cutting measures . <p> It has raised concerns amongst some people who feel the services could become detached from users in the borough and inaccessible to some groups . <p> But Victim Support north west area manager for London , Natalie Ker-Watson , said : " The closure of our Avenue House premises will not harm our services for victims of crime in Barnet . <p> " We are simply relocating our senior managers and administrative people to save money on rent and make us more efficient . " <p> The service , which receives an annual grant of ? 14,250 from Barnet Council , has undergone a regional management restructuring meaning borough manager posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " local schemes " . <p> The money saved from premises costs will be redirected to front line services , and Ms Ker-Watson said they will remain in touch with victims in the borough through the setting up " outreach sites " in accessible locations . <h> Promoted stories <p> She said : " Our service will still be delivered by local volunteers in the borough who can continue to make home visits as normal . <p> " We also have the use of facilities at Burnt Oak library as a meeting place and are setting up two other outreach sites to make sure we remain accessible to people who need us .

" <p> Share article <p> Ms Ker-Watson said the plans were an " enhancement " to what they were already providing and hoped the use of council and other charities ' facilities across the borough will help soften any impact the move from Avenue House may have . <p> Anyone who is concerned about the move , or would like more information on Victim Support Barnet , can call 020 8965 1141 . <h> Ipsoregulated <p> This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .
