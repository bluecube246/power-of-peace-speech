http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16924287

the incident occurred after the conservative peer took exception at remarks by ex-cabinet minister lord king suggesting veterans of the world war two were looking " pretty old " .  ' age worn lightly '  the peer , who worked at code-breaking facility bletchley park during the war , told the bbc afterwards that she had intended the gesture but she and the former defence secretary remained " jolly good friends " .  mr clarke follows in the footsteps of the likes of sir david attenborough and joanna lumley in winning the award .  broadcaster jon snow , one of the judges , said mr clarke had been an mp for more than 40 years and a minister for 30 while maintaining a varied range of interests outside politics - including jazz and cigars .  " this year he will be 72 , still one of the most characterful men on either front bench . he displays all the characteristics of a cast-iron oldie : true to his principles , age worn lightly , still in the job long after his work , margaret thatcher and john major . not only is he justifiably and prominently the oldie of the year but he is also the political survivor of the year . "  baroness trumpington also served in government under margaret thatcher . the oldie said her award was in recognition of her being a " stalwart of the old school and robust champion of the senior citizen " .  referring to the exchange with lord king , it said she had " registered her objection in swift and incontrovertible terms " .
