The incident occurred after the Conservative peer took exception at remarks by ex-Cabinet minister Lord King suggesting veterans of the World War Two were looking " pretty old " .  ' Age worn lightly '  The peer , who worked at code-breaking facility Bletchley Park during the war , told the BBC afterwards that she had intended the gesture but she and the former defence secretary remained " jolly good friends " .  Mr Clarke follows in the footsteps of the likes of Sir David Attenborough and Joanna Lumley in winning the award .  Broadcaster Jon Snow , one of the judges , said Mr Clarke had been an MP for more than 40 years and a minister for 30 while maintaining a varied range of interests outside politics - including jazz and cigars .  " This year he will be 72 , still one of the most characterful men on either front bench . He displays all the characteristics of a cast-iron Oldie : true to his principles , age worn lightly , still in the job long after his work , Margaret Thatcher and John Major . Not only is he justifiably and prominently the Oldie of the Year but he is also the political survivor of the year . "  Baroness Trumpington also served in government under Margaret Thatcher . The Oldie said her award was in recognition of her being a " stalwart of the old school and robust champion of the senior citizen " .  Referring to the exchange with Lord King , it said she had " registered her objection in swift and incontrovertible terms " .
