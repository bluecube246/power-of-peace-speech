There was however no such doubt over hosts Spain 20 years ago when they defeated Poland in the final to take gold in Catalonia . <p> Almost 100,000 spectators filled the Camp Nou to see Bar ? a favourites Albert Ferrer and Pep Guardiola , joined by Real Madrid 's Luis Enrique , Sporting Gij ? n 's Abelardo and Atletico Madrid 's Kiko and others , as they took on Poland in the final , having defeated Italy and Ghana in the quarter and semi-finals . <p> In a pulsating match , the moment came in the 90th minute . It was Kiko , who had given Spain a 2-1 lead earlier , who pounced in stoppage-time to beat the Poles 3-2 in a dramatic finale .
