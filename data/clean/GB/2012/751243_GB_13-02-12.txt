<p> Check , courtesy of Lucky Chip , who are following in the Meatwagon 's footsteps , selling their delicious beef concoctions out of a van . Clean-off-the-bone ribs translated into a portable lunch ? <p> Mark ' The Ribman ' Gevaux will happily be your saviour if you venture to nearby Brick Lane on a Sunday . <p> Authentic wood-fired pizzas ? Local wunderkinds Homeslice have it covered , or at least they did until their doughy end-of-year success led them to pursue pop-up opportunities further afield , including an exciting , in-the-works project on Portobello Road . <p> For Gevaux , in particular , 2011 was a fantastic year , with The Long Table night market in Dalston , the success of his ' Holy Fuck ' hot sauce , and joining up with eat.st being particular highlights . <p> He puts the success of street food in Hackney down to the borough 's adventurous culture and relative affordability : " One of the reasons street food has thrived in Hackney and not Kensington is that I ca n't see the people of Kensington sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum , " he says . <p> " They are missing out . Also , I should think the rents would price many of us out . I work on such a tight profit margin my prices would have to go up so much I would be embarrassed . " <p> The rise of quality street food in London is going a long way to countering popular misconceptions about American-style dining . As anyone who has ever sampled proper Yankee fare will tell you , it 's a far cry from what 's peddled at McDonald 's and TGI Friday 's . <p> Even the humble hot dog -- usually linked to dodgy vendors in Leicester Square and even dodgier tummies -- has experienced a renaissance on Old Street in the hands of the permanently cheerful Abiye and his gleaming Big Apple Hot Dog cart . <p> According to Pizza man George Whiting of Homeslice , Hackney 's creative spirit as an important factor in the rise of its street food scene : " Hackney has a young , creative culture at the moment and I think the street food culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it give talented people an opportunity to do their own thing without breaking the bank , but it helps rejuvenate otherwise disused areas . " <p> Driven by the passion of people like Whiting and Gevaux , the future of street food looks bright indeed . A weekend stroll down another of 2011 's big success stories , Chatsworth Road market , showcases the full spectrum of local street eats : everything from the gourmet ethical offerings at Vegan Peasant to the warming pho and inspired fusion baguettes at longstanding Hackney favourites Bahnmi11 . <p> The taste for street food is also spreading to the upper echelons of the culinary world . Upmarket City and West End steakhouse Hawksmoor not only serve Big Apple hot dogs in their restaurants , they recently traded suits for skinny jeans and set up shop at The Long Table in Dalston . And Abiye 's hot dogs now feature at man-of-the-moment Russell Norman 's new joint , Mishkins . <p> Only a few years ago , this street food revolution seemed like the pipedream of a few madmen ( and women ) willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste of the real deal . But happen it did . And perhaps , given that sherry has morphed from Nan 's afternoon pick-me-up into a hip tipple in the space of just twelve months , that 's not so surprising after all .
