<p> They are investigating why a copse of cypress trees was the only vegetation to have survived a wildfire that destroyed acres of forest on hills around the Valencian town of Andilla last month . <p> Aerial images show the devastation of about 50,000 acres except for a vibrant patch of green where a group of around 1,000 cypress trees stand tall . <p> Despite the fact that the trees were planted close together , their branches intertwined , the flames did not advance through them , and only 12 trees out of 958 showed signs of fire damage , while all around the native tree species such as pine , holm oak , juniper and gorse , were destroyed . <p> The mystery and what it might mean has sparked a debate over forest regeneration with some experts advising that cypresses should be planted in areas prone to wildfires to act as a natural firebreak . <p> " The trees acted like a screen against the fire , " Bernabe Moya , the director of forestry for the Valencia region told Spanish daily El Pais . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of cypresses to reinforce the firebreaks in hard to-reach areas . " <p> Other supporters suggested the trees could be planted to form a screen around inhabited areas . <p> Morocco has sent two water-bombing planes to help Spain battle a stubborn 10-day-old wildfire that has blazed its way through the Canary Island of La Gomera . <p> This year 's summer forest fire season is one of the worst in recent memory prompting the search for innovative solutions . <p> Other experts , however , remain sceptical about the powers of cypress trees . <p> Raul de la Calle , of the Official Association of Technical Forest Engineers , said : " We will have to find out what really happened . The cypress is not a very combustible species , but to the point that it does n't burn at all ? There is no such thing as a fireproof tree . " <p> And environmentalists warn of other dangers of introducing non-native species on a widespread scale . <p> " Introducing a species that is n't native is a mistake , " said Nicolas Lopez , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endangers the rest of the flora . " <p> A symposium to discuss the phenomenon of " the fireproof trees " has been organised for September .
