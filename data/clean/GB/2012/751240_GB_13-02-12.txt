within the space of just a few days , more than 75,000 consumers signed up to a pioneering campaign to secure cheaper gas and electricity tariffs .  which ? has launched the first " collective purchasing " trial for energy in britain , although such schemes have been used successfully in other european countries , such as the netherlands .  already the " big switch " scheme has cross-party support : the new energy secretary , ed davey , has said he wants to see other similar schemes launched , in a bid to drive down energy costs for consumers , while the shadow minister , caroline flint ( below right ) , described it as a " trailblazing way to help bring down soaring bills " .  but how does the scheme work , and what can you save ? the following questions and answers provide more information .  this is another name for group buying . which ? is coordinating the initiative and is looking for as many people to sign-up as possible . the more names it gets , the able to persuade the energy companies to offer a more competitive deal .  what rates are being offered ?  this is n't known as yet . once the registration period ends , and which ? knows how many consumers have signed up , it will invite the major energy suppliers to bid for their business . it will conduct a " reverse auction " , offering the deal to the company with the lowest tariff . it will then contact individual home owners , detailing the potential savings and inviting them to switch .  how many people are likely to sign up ?  people have until the end of march to join the campaign . given that 40,000 have signed up so far , the numbers are likely to run into the hundreds of thousands .  richard lloyd , executive director of which ? , added : " the bigger the group , the stronger our bargaining power will be . we are urging anyone who is angry about the state of the energy market to sign up . the big switch is the first chance will the energy suppliers offer cheaper tariffs ? i thought they had just lowered their prices ?  the company that secures this deal can expect to win thousands of new customers , so it is hoped suppliers will tender some competitive rates . and as this is the first of these schemes there will no doubt be considerable publicity for whichever supplier wins the auction .  if i sign up will i be obliged to switch ?  no . once the deal has been secured , which ? will contact all those who have signed up , giving them a personalised estimate of the likely savings . you are n't obliged to switch , so if the savings are n't significant enough , or you do n't like the terms of the deal , you simply stick with your current provider .  according to ofgem , the energy regulator , about 60pc of consumers have never switched energy providers . but it 's hoped initiatives like this may encourage more to switch if it produces bigger savings and is spearheaded by a trusted consumer brand , such live ?  no . this is a nationwide scheme . usually suppliers will quote different rates for different regions . but here which ? is asking for a rate that will be applicable for all regions . this may mean that some people stand to make more substantial savings than others . after the auction , consumers will be asked to provide details , such as postcode and current energy consumption , so which ? can provide a more accurate estimate of potential savings .  who will save the most ?  those who have never switched before , pay their bills quarterly by cheque and still get their gas and electricity from different suppliers stand to make the biggest savings . but it 's hoped that the rate offered will beat the current best buys , potentially benefiting a far wider group of consumers .  what if i am on a fixed-rate tariff ?  there is usually a penalty to pay from moving away from a fixed-rate tariff during the period ( most are one or two-year contracts ) . this does n't stop you signing to factor in this penalty when calculating potential savings . it may means it 's not cost effective to switch .  will i have to move to online billing and paying by direct debit ?  it 's not yet known what type of deal will be secured . it may be an online tariff or may require customers to pay by direct debit . mr lloyd said they were aiming for a relatively simple deal that would appeal to as many people as possible . there are likely to be options though for those who only want to switch one fuel .  how long will the deal last ?  this will depend what deals are offered via the auction . it could be that this is a one-year deal , which will require customers to stick with the supplier for 12 months . it 's unlikely to tie them in for any longer period . if this proves successful then which ? may run a similar scheme next year , which would be open both to new customers and to those who have taken advantage of this  while 5m people switch energy suppliers a year , the majority of people have never moved . which ? has previously estimated that energy companies are making some ? 4bn a year from this consumer apathy , which is the difference between the standard tariffs , which are paid by the majority of consumers , and the most competitive deals offered new customers . one of the reasons cited for people not switching is there is little perceived difference between the major suppliers .  it is hoped that this approach , whereby a third party negotiates on behalf of a large group of consumers , may prove a more effective way of driving down energy costs .  who else could offer such a scheme ?  mr lloyd said if the big switch proved successful it was an idea they were keen to apply to other markets .  there has been talk of local authorities , trade and credit unions and housing associations offering their own collective purchasing deals .  although on a smaller scale , similar arrangements are deployed to buy heating oil . comparison pass on the bulk discount to consumers .  and village schemes are becoming increasingly popular , such as the one set up in west challow , oxfordshire . up to 95pc of the village has signed up , cutting fuel costs by up to 1p per litre . the website incahoot.com , which already offers " group discount deals " on utility bills , is now also offering a shopping discount scheme .
