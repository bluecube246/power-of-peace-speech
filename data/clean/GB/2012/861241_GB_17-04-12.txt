That 's your problem , yeah . " <p> The case was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission who passed the file to the Crown Prosecution Service . <p> It was initially decided not to prosecute Mr MacFarlane , but the case was reviewed after the man 's lawyers complained . <p> The CPS has now concluded that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction " . <p> The announcement came as the police watchdog announced a review of a string of complaints about racism at the Metropolitan Police , warning of the risks of " much wider disaffection and dissatisfaction " with the force . <p> There are now 11 separate allegations under investigation , involving 10 police officers . <p> Alison Saunders , chief prosecutor for London , said she had advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane despite the CPS 's decision not to charge him in January . <p> " In March , the complainant 's lawyers challenged that decision and , in accordance with standard CPS practice , Grace Ononiwu , Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London , directed that the case be reviewed by a more senior lawyer who was not previously involved . <p> " That review is now complete and the conclusion , based on all the evidence now available , is that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction to charge PC MacFarlane with a racially aggravated public order offence contrary to Section 4a of the Public Order Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 . <p> " When a review shows a previous decision not to prosecute is wrong , it is open to the CPS to rectify that error by bringing new proceedings . " <p> Ms Saunders said the original CPS decision was " regrettable " , adding that a prosecution was necessary to maintain public confidence . <p> PC MacFarlane was stripped of his duties in relation to the mobile phone footage . <p> The arrested man , named as Mauro Demetrio , 21 , from Beckton , east London , was held on suspicion of drug-driving in August last year but no action was later taken . <p> The charging announcement came as Met Commissioner Bernard-Hogan Howe appeared before MPs over the force 's review of racist allegations . <p> Ms Saunders said : " As Chief Crown Prosecutor for London , I have taken the decision in this case that , as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction , and a prosecution being in the public interest , a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Code for Crown Prosecutors when reinstituting a prosecution . <p> " Accordingly , I have advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane . <p> " It is regrettable that the original decision was wrong , but I hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the CPS to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary . " <p> An additional charge of assault relating to an allegation of " strangulation " will not be pursued , the CPS said . <p> Ms Saunders added : " However , having now had opportunity to consider all available evidence , including the statements of others in the van alongside the recording , the lawyer reviewing the case concluded that the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened were such that no additional charge could properly be added . <p> " The inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant - the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this . <p> " There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took hold of the complaint , did so . He and other witnesses say it was in response to the complainant 's apparent aggression and in self-defence . <p> " I agree with the conclusion that , in the circumstances , there is insufficient evidence to meet the Code test for bringing charges . " <p> Another allegation of abuse by a police officer against a youth at Forest Gate police station remains under consideration , the CPS said .
