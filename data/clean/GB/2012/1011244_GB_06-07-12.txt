<h> Why the creation of a ' European ' identity necessitates unashamed antisemitism from Brussels <p> Day by day , minute by minute , speech by speech and word by word , the United Kingdom Independence Party looks and sounds increasingly like the Conservative Party in exile . <p> Their policies cover the economy , law and order , education , defence , patriotism , Christianity , immigration , over-regulation , tax reduction , and their support for private enterprise , traditional marriage and the family , and ( of course ) the thorny question of the European Union . There is no longer any credible assertion that UKIP is a ' single-issue ' protest party or pressure group . <p> And now , just as we have our long-held suspicions confirmed that the Foreign Office is essentially Arabist and ever so subtly anti-Israel , with government officials outrageously asserting that Benjamin Netanyahu uses ' the incitement issue as a delaying tactic in peace talks ' , we hear that Nigel Farage is confronting the ' strong bias ' against Israel that exists within the European Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? <p> ' There is within the European institutions a very strong anti-Israel bias ' , Mr Farage said . ' I would almost say -- and I am bit nervous of saying this -- there 's almost a new trendy form of anti-Semitism creeping in ... <p> ' I could show you , within the last three months , transcripts of several dozen speeches in the European Parliament . There is a fundamental dislike of Israel . But it 's more than that . And we find that objectionable and worrying . ' <p> And , as ever , he and his party are united in putting their votes where their convictions lie : they are opposing calls to suspend the EU 's trade agreements with Israel , and they remain highly critical of EU aid to the Palestinian Authority , some of which is routinely filtered to schools to teach the next generation about Islam , Jihad , martyrdom , and how to purify their land of the evil Zionist Jews . <p> Payment : The EU gives hundreds of millions of pounds a year to the Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in the European Parliament ' , Farage said , ' is that we object to 300 million euros a year being given to the PA -- the sum is lower this year , it was up to 500 million a couple of years ago -- with , from what I can see , absolutely no check or proper audit of how that money is disbursed or where it is being spent . <p> ' I do n't think you should give money to anybody until you can absolutely guarantee that it is not falling into the wrong hands . The wrong hands could be fraud or , in the case we are discussing here , some of the groups who behaved in a very unpeaceful manner . ' <p> I like ' unpeaceful ' . It is n't a word , but it 's rather more evocative than belligerent , militant , violent or war-like . It reminds us that there are very many peaceable Palestinians who are victims in this struggle , made passively to suffer at the hands of their own government . Yet the EU turns a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perpetuate its love-in with Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority . <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> Farage adds : ' I almost feel that the reason the EU gives this money is because it wants to appear to do the very opposite of everything America wants . ' <p> The UKIP leader is not the first person to observe that the EU manifests anti-American proclivities . In a Westminster Hall debate on 29th March 2000 , Michael Fabricant MP said : " According to President Chirac : ' The object of the European defence identity is to contain the United States . ' That is some quote -- quite extraordinary . Speaking in Paris in December , Chancellor Schr ? der echoed President Chirac 's comment , stating : ' Whining about US dominance is not good enough . We have to act . ' Such anti-American rhetoric may go down well with continental audiences but it certainly does not reflect British interests . " <p> Such comments lend serious weight to the observation made almost 20 years ago by Bernard Connolly in his book ' The Rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacques Delors ' wants to create a new state , " Europe " , and to create with it a new " nation " based on some supposed cultural identity that can be defined only in terms of what it is not , what it is antithetical to ' . <p> And so the EU is pathologically anti-American , anti-Anglo-Saxon , anti-Capitalism , anti-state , anti-individualist and anti-Israel ; the logical corollary of which is that it is pro the antithesis or converse of each , hence the rationale for pouring millions of euros of aid into Gaza and the West Bank . <p> Farage says of this : ' I understand why Israel may be prone to deep concern when there are neighbouring states which publicly say they want to obliterate them from the face of the earth . ' <p> He evidently knows his history . He fully understands how sovereignty can be negated and national identity undermined . <p> For the political dream of Palestine to be realised , Israel must cease to be . Neither can agree to compromised borders , and the ' two-state solution ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of Jerusalem . We all desire peace in the Middle East . We all long to see an end to the suffering of the children of Abraham -- both Arabs and Jews . But the EU 's latent or blatant anti-Semitism and facile understanding of the theo-political complexities will only make matters worse . Thank God there 's one person who dares to speak out .
