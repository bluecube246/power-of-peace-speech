Chilling : Right-wing extremist Anders Breivik smirks as he arrives in court in Oslo in the final hearing before his trial begins in April  The right-wing extremist who has admitted killing 77 people in Norway told a court yesterday that he deserved a medal of honour for the bloodshed , and demanded to be set free .  Anders Behring Breivik smirked and gave a salute as he was led in to the Oslo district court , handcuffed and dressed in a dark suit , for his last detention hearing before his trial starts on April 16 .  He stretched out his arms in what his lawyer , Geir Lippestad , said was ' some kind of Right-wing extremist greeting ' .  Breivik , a 32-year-old Norwegian , told the court that Norway 's most deadly peacetime attack was a strike against ' traitors ' he said are embracing immigration to promote ' an Islamic colonisation of Norway ' .  He said : ' I am a militant nationalist . I represent the Norwegian indigenous peoples . We in the Norwegian resistance movement are turned into a minority in our own country . '  About 100 survivors and relatives of victims watched in disbelief as Breivik asked to be released , and told the judge he should be awarded Norway 's highest military medal for the July 22 massacre .  Cuffed : The 32-year-old raises his arms to a guard as he arrived at the court , which was filled with around 100 survivors and family members of the massacre he carried out in July last year  No remorse : Breivik smiles at the camera , left , and at people inside the court room after his arrival this morning . He has admitted killing 77 people during two attacks in Oslo and on Utoya island last year
