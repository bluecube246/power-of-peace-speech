'  but a spokesman from the platform operator , total , said : ' the only confirmation that we have had of anything resembling an oil slick is a sheen of gas condensate . '  he added that this condensate was a light hydrocarbon - similar to petrol - and was expected to dissipate naturally , either evaporating due to warmer weather or through wave action .  danger : the leak from the elgin rig , from that and surrounding oil and gas platforms  meanwhile , the french oil giant has further delayed plans to fly engineers to stem the 11-day leak of explosive gas .  this is due to continuing adverse weather conditions in the area , a company spokesman said yesterday .  strong winds are reportedly blowing the gas cloud towards the spot where a helicopter carrying the team of crisis engineers would land - pushing relief efforts back to today or friday .  the wind direction was initially forecast by the uk 's met office to change by yesterday evening and through this morning .  it would have blown gas away from the landing point and allowed a team of eight experts to assess the steps needed to stop the large and potentially explosive leak .  the company - which has calculated that the leak is costing it ? 1.6million a day - said on tuesday that the team of engineers would assess conditions on the platform and find out whether a so-called ' well kill ' was feasible .  this would involve finding out whether any necessary .  another , more expensive option also being pursued is to dig two relief wells to the source of the gas at 4,000 metres depth , far below the sea bed .  experts have said that can take up to six months to complete . total says it will push up daily costs to more than ? 2million .  total 's share prices have dropped by 6.5 per cent since the leak was reported last week , knocking billions of pounds off its value .  the company said the team of engineers would consist of staff from total and u.s. specialist company wild well control .  fire-fighters and engineers working for the houston-based company are experts at disasters such as oil rig explosions and have been dubbed ' hellfighters ' by hollywood .  yesterday , an offshore worker told of being one of the last men left on board the north sea platform after the gas leak was first detected on march 25 .  william cardno was one of the 19 men who stayed on board the elgin platform to monitor the situation flights .  he said : ' when the first alarm was sounded , we had the helicopter on-scene within one hour .  ' and within an hour after that we had 107 people evacuated . an hour after that , we had the full 220 people evacuated .  ' we deliberately kept 19 people on board the platform to evaluate the situation and to see if there was anything we could do and really to maintain the systems . '  close-up : greenpeace say that the total rig has a large gas cloud surrounding it and has left a condensed gas slick on the water  mr cardino added : ' if we had any escalation at all on the platform we were absolutely confident we could have been off the platform in five minutes by lifeboat .  ' we all practised our lifeboat drill and we checked the lifeboat and strapped ourselves into it . i think this demonstrated that our procedures are good and our process is good .  ' although we never want these things to happen , when it does happen our paramount priority . '  the gas leak is spewing an estimated 200,000 cubic metres of natural gas from beneath the evacuated platform into the air per day , forming a highly explosive gas cloud .
