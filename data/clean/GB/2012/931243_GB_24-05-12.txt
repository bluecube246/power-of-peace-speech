Could not subscribe , try again later <p> Twitter / Rihanna <p> To be fair , she could basically carry off wearing a Tesco bag on her head <p> When you reveal your whole life on Twitter - your holiday snaps , your night out with some Chelsea players , your nearly naked snaps ( a lot of nearly naked snaps ) - then it 's very unlikely you 'll get a new hairdo without telling the whole world about it . <p> Step forward Rihanna , who debuted her new dreadlocked ' do at the American Idol final last night , where she performed Where Have You Been . <p> Twitter / Rihanna <p> Life probably is pretty funny when you 're Rihanna to be honest <p> Posting the picture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreads ' which , er , we do n't really understand but then we 're not a youth like Rihanna . <p> She performed with lots of topless men wearing , er , not many clothes and with a big piece of material hanging between her legs . STYLE EDITOR GILLY , HELP US . <p> " It 's technically a maxi skirt , but there 's not a lot of max going on , " says Gilly . " Techncially it 's called a tiered maxi . " <p> ' Technically ! ' We love Gilly . <p> Rex <p> Ok , go on what would you call it ? <p> Rex <p> ... and a different angle for your viewing pleasure <p> Rex <p> If this was us , that material would move slightly to the left and it would be awful <p> Rex <p> ... but that kind of thing does n't happen to Rihanna <p> She also says it 's a bit like Kylie and Karen Gillan 's skirt as sported at Cannes this year . <p> She shouted " I love you , Idol !
