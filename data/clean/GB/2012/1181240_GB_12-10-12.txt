a total of 1,098 market badge holders from 690 companies attended , up from last year 's 1,080 badge holders from 583 companies . organisers reported about 70 deals including titles such as masquerade , the thieves and paganini : the devil 's violinist and " a significant increase " in market screening from 64 to 80 year-on-year , and 281 online screenings .  although attendees echoed opinions of previous years that it is a good place to meet people but often deals are closed later at tiffcom or afm , several deals were also struck at the asian film market this year , and certain expectations turned on their heads .  " this is my first time here and i was pre-warned that it is great if you have an asian film , but i had a canadian film . we were imagining we 'd make contact here and close later , but managed to close a deal to korea here in addition to meeting buyers from japan , taiwan and hong kong , " says filmoption international vice president of distribution and sales shawn linden , which world premiered in the world cinema selection , to priya for korea .  " the screenings here are brilliant , the audiences amazing , and the venues fantastic . it 's all very well organised . the buyer was in the festival screening audience and the audience adored it . all three screenings were packed . it makes a huge difference to have a distributor see the film that way . we had no such expectations -- we had hoped but mostly were just counting on this to lead up to afm . but now we will proceed with a little confidence in the back pocket , " he said .  the european film promotion ( efp ) also announced a slew of deals from their umbrella stand ( see separate story ) .  " we talked to our sales agents and they are all very satisfied with this year 's asian film market , " said efp film sales support staff cornelia klimkeit . " it was good to follow up meeting from toronto here . a lot of deals were struck or initiating negotiations here but many were completed or almost completed here . "  " what 's very interesting is that memories corner from last year , closed a deal to japan after the market and this year will be released there by medalien media . but it is n't just films in the festival that can sell here and so it 's worthwhile for our sellers to return , " she said .  other deals reported to organisers include korean sales company cj entertainment selling deranged , spellbound , perfect number and masquerade to twin for japan . the last film also sold to joy n contents for thailand . amongst other korean companies , indiestory sold dancing cat and mother to agaligo for thailand , and mirovision sold japanese oscar entry and biff selection our homeland to edko for hong kong . the company also sold fest title melo to sundream for hong kong .  us sales company cmg ( cinema management group ) sold creature and no tell motel to jncg for korea and still to sycomad for korea . zambezia , khumba and the collection celluloid dreams/nightmares sold outrage beyond to maywin media for russia as well as 10 films ' vod rights to china .  the market closed with a raft awards including the new technicolor asia award and the arte award . see below for full list .  most popular  advertise with us  screen international provides a range of effective advertising opportunities both in print and online . our commercial team will work with you to build the most effective package for your marketing requirement .  subscribe to screen  screen international is the essential resource for the international film industry . a subscription now offers much greater value with full access to screendaily.com , screenbase and screen international magazine . rely on us for expert news analysis , insight and data .  screen international  screen international is the leading film industry resource covering the international film markets . we provide a whole-industry perspective from some of the most knowledgeable writers and data analysts in the business . across print and online mediums , screen international delivers analysis , opinion and commentary on the issues , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
