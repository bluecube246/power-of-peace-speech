<h> Your Vogue history <h> Model Safety <p> 17 April 2012 <p> Lauren Milligan <p> Carole White , founder of Premier Model Management <p> AFTER Premier founder and legendary model agent Carole White met MP Jo Swinson to discuss the treatment of models under the age of 18 on BBC Radio 4 's Women 's Hour , they decided to continue the discussion afterwards - with Swinson paying a visit to Premier 's offices . A productive visit ( " we can both talk ! " laughed White ) , they discussed model chaperoning ; the regulation of unscrupulous agents ; how models are scouted ; how agencies support models ; how the casting and booking process works ; and whether agencies should bear any responsibility for the shape of catwalk models , and the effect of the media 's promotion of thin as ideal on women generally . <p> " Modelling agencies clearly take the view that they are catering for the market as it is , without passing judgement on whether our visual culture is healthy or to be welcomed , " Swinson said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that fashion designers , magazines and modelling agencies all claim they ca n't change the way things work , as the other parts of the system require them to design for , book or scout a particular type of girl . " <p> " I understand her point of view , " White said . " Paris and NY want girls to be really too skinny and the designers should make their sample sizes more realistic , but I feel it will never change that much because the designers are selling a dream which is taken down and changed by the high street . On the catwalk , girls will always be tall and skinny . It is not as extreme as she believes but it 's always easy to pick on a young , pretty , tall , skinny girl is n't it ! ? " <p> So what needs to change ? <p> " Child models should receive the same protection as child actors and be chaperoned to shoots and catwalk shows until they are 16 and arguably beyond , " Swinson argued . " Given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 18 by 2015 , the industry should consider what impact this will have on the age of models they should employ . " <p> " Obviously young models are chaperoned to a degree and often when they travel they have a parent with them , " White explained . " However if a model is used to London , and feels confident that they can get around , very often after a while they do n't want or need a chaperone . As agents we know all of our clients and are able to discuss with them if a girl needs someone with them or not . We always talk to the parents as well . " <p> " To my mind there should be more done about obese teenagers and education in nutrition and exercise which we do with all our models , " White added . " We want fit , healthy girls ; that is always our goal . "
