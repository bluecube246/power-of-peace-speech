CERN , home of the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , has seen a tenfold surge in candidates applying for hard-to-fill vacancies , after turning to social media .  CERN , based in Geneva , says it has seen the number of applicants for typical jobs grow from 30 to 50 to over 500 during the last 12 months .  The nuclear research establishment has transformed its recruitment processes by replacing one-off ads in specialist publications and on job sites with recruitment on Twitter , Facebook and investing in cloud-based recruitment platforms .  Over the past six months , it has attracted over 500 referrals from Facebook alone , said James Purvis , head of talent acquisition at CERN .  " Facebook is a massive referral network . A lot of people are finding out about jobs from friends of friends , " Purvis told Computer Weekly .  The organisation , which recruits between 200 permanent staff each year , has traditionally relied on its high-profile brand to attract suitable candidates .  The Large Hiring Challenge  But CERN has problem known internally as the Large Hiring Challenge .  " People think you have to be a particle physicist to work at CERN , but we employ very few physicists . We need technicians , engineers , accountants , lawyers , and firefighters , " said Purvis , speaking ahead of a conference on HR technology .  Got the job -- now read the T Shirt  Sometimes the low tech , or even the no-tech solution to recruitment is the best approach , says James Purvis , head of talent acquisition at CERN .  The research organisation recently had to come up with an innovative solution to overcome a major shortage of Java engineers .  " We tried all the different job boards , job postings and social media . We tried videos on YouTube , we put posts on Facebook and on Java job boards , " said Purvis .  In the end , the answer proved much simpler .  " We realised that our Java engineers are presenting at numerous conferences in Europe and the US , " he said .  journals and specialist job sites , which took up a huge amount of HR staff time , with a high-speed cloud-based service .  The service , known as Broadbean can post a job vacancy to 40 or 50 job sites across Europe with a single click .  " We used to do sporadic advertising . We went to one job board , and it cost us ? 600-900 to post one job . Now we can get a factor of ten cost savings by buying in bulk . The administration cost is a lot lower , " he said .  Video interviews  CERN has made further savings by screening shortlisted candidates remotely , through cloud-based video service , Sonru , rather than interviewing each candidate face to face .  James Purvis , CERN  " We have carried out 1,500 interviews using Sonru . We can reduce the number of candidates we need to interview in Geneva and have seen at least a 20% saving in recruitment costs , " said Purvis .  The system has allowed CERN to weed out candidates who look good an early stage .  It gives recruitment managers the freedom to review the videos when it suits them . " ' To Sonru ' has now become a verb at CERN , " said Purvis .  Social Media  CERN 's HR team is producing a large range of videos for Facebook and YouTube to attract potential recruits .  They raise CERN 's profile as an employer and give candidates advice on applying for jobs at the organisation , said Purvis .  And the HR team is using Twitter to post job vacancies . This helps to push CERN 's recruitment pages up the rankings in Google , says Purvis . " We want to make sure we are up at the top , " he said .  Tracking applicants  The programme has left CERN with another problem -- how to track the growing number of candidates that are applying for vacancies .  " Because of the success of our advertising and Sonru , we have moved from dealing with 30 or 50 applicants per post to several hundred per post , " said system since 2002 , but Purvis is looking at improvements that could made applicant tracking easier .  " Our applicant tracking system is very robust , but our process runs on the assumption that the recruiter needs to review each CV , " he said . " We are looking to give rankings to candidates based on their skills and experience , rather than read every CV " he said .  Purvis plans to upgrade the applicant tracking system next year . The main technical challenge will be integrating it with CERN 's Oracle-based HR system .  Because CERN is a government organisation , it needs a sophisticated HR system that can deal with issues such as helping staff relocate , and finding schools for workers ' children .  " Technology has allowed us to deliver more with the same resources . It has allowed us to better meet the needs of the organisation , particularly in areas we were not managing to do a few years ago , " said Purvis .
