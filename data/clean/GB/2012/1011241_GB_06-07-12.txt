Where Mormonism meets Scientology

damian thompson is editor of telegraph blogs and a columnist for the daily telegraph . he was once described by the church times as a " blood-crazed ferret " . he is on twitter as holysmoke . his latest book is the fix : how addiction is taking over your world . he also writes about classical music for the spectator .  where mormonism meets scientology  we can take it for granted that tom cruise -- whose divorce proceedings are already such a catastrophe for scientology -- will never talk in public about xenu . the existence of this intergalactic emperor , who flourished c 75,000,000 bc , was top secret until the church 's enemies took to the internet . advice to journalists : if you ask cruise about xenu , the doors of hollywood ( where the church wields immense influence ) will slam in your face .  on the other hand , it 's safe to ask any scientologist about kolob . this is the star , or possibly planet , that is closest to the throne of god . astronomers as the inspiration for the planet kobol in battlestar galactica .  why is it safe to ask cruise about kolob ? because it 's mormon , not scientologist : it appears in the book of abraham , " translated " from egyptian papyri by joseph smith , the founder of mormonism . i use inverted commas because smith could n't read egyptian . the papyri were funerary texts .  the person you must n't ask about kolob is mitt romney . the teaching is n't a secret , but latter-day saints are n't keen to discuss it . these days they stress their similarity with christianity , and there 's no kolob in the gospels .  admittedly , from a secular point of view , eating bread in the belief that it 's the body of a **25;184;toolong who rose from the dead is as bizarre as hooking yourself up to an e-meter , like scientologists , or baptising the dead , like mormons . yet there are striking similarities between the sects founded by joseph smith and l ron hubbard . these brilliant mavericks used popular culture some esoteric details for senior initiates .  smith invented a journey by ancient hebrews to america -- a typical fantasy of the time -- and dabbled in the occult . hubbard mined the seam of mid-20th-century american science fiction , and also devised a brain-cleansing technique called dianetics that was supposed to produce perfect recall . it failed hilariously .  critics accused smith and hubbard of telling porkies . the former 's interpretation of the egyptian papyri , which he encountered in a travelling mummy exhibition , is plain embarrassing . as for hubbard , his war service was a work of the imagination to rival the science fiction he wrote before he discovered religion and its tax-exempt status . both organisations are extremely interested in money , and very good at acquiring it .  the two prophets were heartily interested in the opposite sex : smith acquired some 33 wives , while hubbard encouraged teenage girl " officers " to wear hot pants .  also , both religions went down the paramilitary route . we 've read this week about the " sea org " that to join ( a claim denied by the church ) . but that 's nothing compared with the mormon militia which fought in the mexican-american war . later , mormon " avenging angels " were implicated in blood-curdling murders after they moved to utah .  the latter-day saints cleaned up their act . but they were the scientologists of their day -- and they 're still evasive enough for the public to make the subliminal connection .  that 's why mitt romney , who dresses like a mormon but flashes a scientologist 's smile , must be worried by the cruise-holmes divorce . this year of all years , he does n't want the word " cult " splashed all over the front pages .  why are we paying for agitprop ?  the bbc 's new director-general , george entwistle , is a former editor of newsnight . i wonder if he knows how much damage is being done to its reputation by paul mason , its economics editor ? mason was in the guardian on monday , sucking up to student protesters . in the words sort of lefty who rants about the ' end of the neoliberal experiment ' between interviews with dreadlocked , dope-smoking hippies squatting in some arab oil trader 's chelsea townhouse " . george , if you think this man is impartial , why not go the whole hog and give polly toynbee her old job back as the beeb 's social affairs editor ?  hattie : do n't mention her size  eric sykes , who died this week , was one of the gentlemen of comedy . his kindness was on display in an interview he gave about hattie jacques , who played his sister on television . " hat was n't a small woman , " he said , " but we never mentioned her size . "  she was indeed a large lass -- married , improbably , to john le mesurier . fat ladies were one of the comic obsessions of the seaside-postcard era , perhaps because they were rare . that 's less true today , when coffee shops encourage women to eat " muffins " ( ie , high-density lumps of cake ) a starbucks , no one would notice her girth .  not that i 'm preaching , you understand . in these troubled times , why should n't the fairer sex seek solace in sponge ?  a whiff of vichy in the synod  at the time of writing , i do not know whether the church of england 's general synod has voted to ordain women bishops outright , to adopt some risible compromise , or to prolong the agony for a few more years . agony of boredom , that is . let me save you the trouble of following the proceedings with a cut-out-'n ' -keep guide to this tedious debate . you need to know just two things .  first , there 's overwhelming support in the pews for women bishops . second , the anglo-catholic " traditionalists " who want to stay in the church of england behind some sort of firewall are deluded . having turned down the pope 's offer of reunion with rome , the most they can hope for is a playpen inside a wider liberal protestant denomination . as believe that they can stay untainted by the changes . not to be rude , but perhaps they should think of organising a pilgrimage to marshal p ? tain 's grave .  another windbag sounds off  i 've just made a splendid addition to my collection of great left-wing bores of today . step forward " economist " umair haque , a self-regarding young windbag who writes for the harvard business review . here 's a sample of his witterings : " if this so-called debate over globalisation often feels a little tedious , trivial , and about as in touch with reality as kim kardashian is with kibare , it 's because it 's a status quo-preserving debate . " and here 's one of his tweets : " it 's kinda lol how our national discussion is like competing determinisms sock-puppeting civilization to death . or not so lol . " apparently he does n't like being teased online , so i hope you 'll all respect that . he is @umairh on twitter .
