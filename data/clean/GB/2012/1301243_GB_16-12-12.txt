Hereford and Folkestone closures are bad news for horse racing
http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/20747679

<p> When considering the closures - for the time being , at least - of Hereford and Folkestone racecourses , I need to declare an immediate interest . <p> I actually have no recollection of going to Hereford for the first time , simply because I was so young at the time . But like many families that lived close by , the Lysaghts attended loyally , with a March Saturday and the Whitsun bank holiday fixture especially popular . This was in the days before a short-lived Boxing Day meeting . <p> It is important for the future of jumping that the smaller tracks , other Herefords and Folkestones , survive <p> What I do recall , however , is going with some friends when aged three and a half . The racecard ( which I still possess ) contained the names of such 1960s riding legends as Terry Biddlecombe and Eddie Harty . <p> And , pun entirely intended , I knew the form : the location of the weighing room , the bookies ( though even the most amiable refused us ) and knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . <p> Forty-five-plus years later , the party that has been going on at Hereford since 1771 ( and since 1898 at Folkestone ) is over , after Arena Racing Company ( ARC ) , the owner or leaseholder of 17 tracks in all , made the closure decision . <p> At Hereford , the fixtures have been moved elsewhere , and although the track is technically licensed for 2013 , officials do not anticipate any racing taking place . <p> You will understand , therefore , the deep sense of sadness being felt by this son of Herefordshire ; something similar no doubt applies to regulars at its doomed sister course in Kent . <p> ARC 's bosses insist that neither is viable in its current form , and that they make no money . However , they say that if an extension on the current 17-year lease at Hereford can be sorted - and planning issues at Folkestone likewise resolved - the closures , the first of any longstanding track since Stockton , Teesside , in 1981 , could be reversed . <p> There is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bath <p> Brighton <p> Chepstow <p> Doncaster <p> Ffos Las <p> Folkestone <p> Fontwell Park <p> Great Yarmouth <p> Hereford <p> Lingfield Park <p> Newcastle <p> Royal Windsor <p> Sedgefield <p> Southwell <p> Uttoxeter <p> Wolverhampton <p> Worcester <p> In large racecourse groups like ARC , just one aspect of the Reuben Brothers ' business empire , the shareholders are king . <p> A large portion of the lucrative revenue from media rights and the income from the bookmakers ' levy does not remain at the tracks where it is generated but is soon off to the holding company 's coffers . <p> There is a suspicion among some that the sport is of secondary importance . <p> In contrast , some of the people running independent courses - Taunton in Somerset is a good example - are less concerned about shareholders and able to plough their cash back into facilities and prize money . <p> It may be naive to think everyone can operate like this , but it is important for the future of jumping that the smaller tracks - other Herefords and Folkestones - survive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vast pyramid , at the top of which stand the bigger fixtures , like Cheltenham and Aintree , that operate as the sport 's shop window . <p> Horses that are to climb to the top need somewhere to start : early sorties in the successful careers of good hurdlers Mrs Muck and Mighty Man took place at Hereford . The demise of racing in Herefordshire and in Kent is not just sad for local racegoers ; it is bad news for the sport as a whole . <p> At the final Hereford meeting , ARC 's Jim Allen said : " We will keep it as a racecourse , maintaining the fences , hurdles and running rails , cutting and fertilising the racetrack . <p> " We are happy to talk to anyone because we will do what we can to keep racing . I could see it in action in 2014 . " <p> Many of us hope he is correct but there is one especially worrying statistic : no course that has been closed down , other than in war time , has ever reopened .
