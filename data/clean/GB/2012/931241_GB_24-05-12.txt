" We have changed procedures this weekend and procedures have been notified to other teams as well .  " The fire took a heavy toll . We 've had to replace pretty much everything but we 're back fully operational .  " If you go to the garage , you would n't know we had a fire .  " Every team has offered to help us and it was fantastic to see the support . "  Thirty mechanics from a variety of teams involved in the fire fight were seen by doctors and have been released except a Williams employee who was airlifted from Spain to England for treatment to burns on his arms and legs .  " Things are going well and he should be out in 10 days . He 's in good spirits , " added Gillan .  " Collectively we need look at level of cover which was in place - both fire and medical support . Undoubtedly things will change as a result .  " Thankfully it 's a very rare occurrence , we need the necessary changes .  " We must learn from this to make sure it does n't happen again but if it does we are better prepared . "  Lewis Hamilton said yesterday he 'd like to make another little piece of history in Sunday 's race .  If he wins he will be the sixth different winner in six races -- the first time that has happened in the sport 's history .  " You can never get bored of winning this race , " he said . " I love it here . It 's my home circuit now I 've moved here and I run it most mornings . "
