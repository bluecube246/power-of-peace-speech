" we have changed procedures this weekend and procedures have been notified to other teams as well .  " the fire took a heavy toll . we 've had to replace pretty much everything but we 're back fully operational .  " if you go to the garage , you would n't know we had a fire .  " every team has offered to help us and it was fantastic to see the support . "  thirty mechanics from a variety of teams involved in the fire fight were seen by doctors and have been released except a williams employee who was airlifted from spain to england for treatment to burns on his arms and legs .  " things are going well and he should be out in 10 days . he 's in good spirits , " added gillan .  " collectively we need look at level of cover which was in place - both fire and medical support . undoubtedly things will change as a result .  " thankfully it 's a very rare occurrence , we need the necessary changes .  " we must learn from this to make sure it does n't happen again but if it does we are better prepared . "  lewis hamilton said yesterday he 'd like to make another little piece of history in sunday 's race .  if he wins he will be the sixth different winner in six races -- the first time that has happened in the sport 's history .  " you can never get bored of winning this race , " he said . " i love it here . it 's my home circuit now i 've moved here and i run it most mornings . "
