police in crisis after flood of racism complaints  the metropolitan police are now facing allegations of racism , abuse and violence involving at least fifteen officers getty images  the metropolitan police has revealed new allegations of racist abuse , bullying and violence involving at least 15 of its officers , threatening a return to the crisis that saw the force branded " institutionally racist " more than a decade ago .  the met referred eight new cases to the police watchdog as part of a hasty review , which was ordered after a recording emerged of an officer calling a 21-year-old black man a " nigger " as he was being arrested after last summer 's riots . senior officers are scrambling to stamp out the crisis and prevent a repeat of the years of soul-searching that followed the macpherson inquiry 's damning report on the investigation of the murder of stephen lawrence in eltham , south-east london , in 1993 .  the revelations also raise questions about the role of the independent police complaints commission ( ipcc ) , which is being . new allegations against police that came to light yesterday included :  * a racist attack against several youths in hyde park in 2011 which involved five police officers , all of whom remain on full duties ;  * mishandling of calls with a " racial element " by a pc in the force 's central communication command in 2010 ;  * claims that a group of officers in newham , east london , used racist language . three have been suspended .  * racist bullying by police and civilian staff against community support officers over an 18-month period . two police officers have been suspended ;  " we 're just glad that what we have seen for a long time has come out , " estelle du boulay , the director of the newham monitoring project , told the independent last night . " it 's a typical picture for us . "  the 10 cases which have come to light in the past week include an alleged attack on a 15-year-old boy in the custody suite at an east london police station . commissioner craig mackey , who led the review , said there could be more referrals to the ipcc in the future .  six of the new cases involved officers blowing the whistle on colleagues , which mr mackey said showed the prevailing attitude in the force .  details of the new allegations , which apparently date back to 2010 , emerged two days after the head of the metropolitan police , bernard hogan-howe , made an appeal to staff to report any racist colleagues .  " the commissioner made it clear after the first alleged incident came to light last weekend that we take the issue of racism extremely seriously , " mr mackey said . " i want to reiterate -- there is no room for racism in the met . "  mr mackey , who said the force had been working closely with the ipcc during the review , said the watchdog had agreed to look again at four cases , but was not able to say why .  in a statement , the ipcc contradicted the claims made by the met . " police and we will assess each case on its merits and make a decision regarding the level of ipcc involvement needed . at this stage , the ipcc has not agreed to investigate any of these latest referrals , " it said .  the macpherson inquiry led to a huge change in british policing after its damning report into the failure of police to convict anyone for the murder of stephen lawrence in 1993 . two members of the racist white gang which stabbed the teenager to death were finally convicted earlier this year following a breakthrough in forensic science .  however , one of the panel members on the macpherson inquiry team , dr richard stone , told the independent that he still considered the force to be institutionally racist .
