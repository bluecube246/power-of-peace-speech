SoftLayer tailors HPC clouds with GPU lining

Recent Articles  Hosting and cloud computing service provider SoftLayer is getting into the modern hybrid supercomputer racket with the launch of GPU-enhanced server instances .  SoftLayer , which is based in Dallas , was founded in 2005 and merged with hosting rival The Planet before being bought up by GI Partners , in 2010 . GI Partners is a private equity company co-headquartered in Menlo Park and London that has $6bn in assets , including data center and telecom operators and real estate . SoftLayer is the resulting entity , and it has all the goodness of all the different firms wrapped up into a single package .  The company is privately held , but said back in December that it had over 100,000 servers under management in its various data centers and that it had over 25,000 customers worldwide using its infrastructure cloud , which it characterizes as the largest in the world . About half of those customers are located outside of the United States , and thus the company said last October that it was investing $75m over the next two network points of presence ( PoPs ) in London , Frankfurt , and Amsterdam to reach that demand .  SoftLayer had $85m in revenues in the quarter , and these metrics put it at a portion of the size of cross-state and OpenStack-obsessed rival Rackspace Hosting , which is based in San Antonio and which had $264.6m in revenues , 78,717 servers , and 161,422 customers in the third quarter of 2011 .  Both SoftLayer and Rackspace developed their own infrastructure control software , but Rackspace has thrown in with NASA to create the OpenStack project , hoping to forge an open source community that can go up against and beat the cloudy infrastructure stack from Amazon 's Web Services behemoth . SoftLayer 's homegrown Infrastructure Management System tool can provision bare metal and virtual servers , and can be accessed either through the customer portal or through an API stack programmatically . And SoftLayer has no interest in moving to OpenStack or anything else at this time , mainly because the IMS tool speaks bare metal as well as virty .  Perhaps equally important for SoftLayer is hosted or virty servers so customers get the right iron for their specific jobs .  " Whatever you want , we 'll crack open the box and drop it in , " Simon West , chief marketing officer at SoftLayer , tells El Reg . SoftLayer has about a dozen different default configurations of server nodes in its data centers , and keeps enough parts on hand in its chop shop so it can spin up any non-standard requests for 20 servers in about two hours . It might take six to eight hours to spin up 100 custom nodes . SoftLayer gets its servers and parts from Super Micro .  Inside SoftLayer 's Dallas data center ( click to enlarge )  The new GPU-goosed service from SoftLayer is available on the hosted servers , not cloud infrastructure , because for the most part customers who are running supercomputing code do n't want another layer of software abstraction burning up processor cycles , memory capacity , and I/O bandwidth . The HPC nodes are based on 3U SuperMicro bare-bones machines that are equipped with the two of the moment , SoftLayer is supporting Intel 's Xeon 2520 , 2650 , and 2690 processors in the HPC nodes , and you can add one or two of Nvidia 's Tesla M2090 GPU coprocessors to the box . These are the top-end Tesla coprocessors ( at least until future coprocessors based on the " Kepler " GPU ship later this year ) and deliver 665 gigaflops of double-precision floating point number crunching each .  A dedicated server node with a single Xeon E5-2620 processor with 16GB of memory runs $500 a month , and adding a single GPU and a 500GB SATA disk only boosts the price to $879 per month . Considering that those GPUs cost several thousand dollars a pop , clearly renting them from SoftLayer -- or any other service provider that can spin up a hybrid ceepie-geepie cloud -- is a good idea unless you know you can keep the infrastructure busy .  SoftLayer has two private Ethernet networks that it uses internally within and across its data centers , which run at Gigabit or 10 Gigabit speeds . Customers wanting to deploy HPC instances costs more to do so on the portions of the SoftLayer data centers that have 10GE switches reaching out to the server nodes . Like Amazon 's Cluster Compute Instances , InfiniBand is not supported on the SoftLayer backbone , but if enough customers asked for it , then it would be easy enough to carve out a chunk of capacity to support InfiniBand .  A base operating system license , which includes a Standard Edition of Windows Server 2008 , or CentOS , Red Hat Enterprise , or Debian Linux , is included in the price . SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is not supported at the time , but you can , if you really want to , run the XenServer hypervisor from Citrix Systems on the HPC instances if you really want to . You can , of course , also load your own software stack onto the images , says West , provided you have paid for them . You have to install the job scheduling and cluster management software of your choice on the nodes .  SoftLayer operates 13 data centers around the world , six ) , Houston , Washington DC , Singapore , and Amsterdam . The HPC instances are available in San Jose , Seattle , Dallas , Singapore , and Amsterdam , starting today . ?
