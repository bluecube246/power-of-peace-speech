<h> I needed all my first aid skills when our helicopter crashed in the middle of nowhere : Ray Mears on why everyone should learn to be lifesavers <p> Ray Mears is on his back , on the floor , pretending to be unconscious . A young woman stands over the 6ft BBC presenter and starts to manipulate his arms and then his legs . <p> ' Please sir , slap my face , ' she says , gently moving his left arm so it is stretched out in front of him , and folding his right over his body so the back of his hand rests on his cheek . ' Bend my leg , and roll me over , ' she continues . In a fluid movement she rolls his body on to his left side . <p> It is a surreal scene -- and everyone giggles . But the purpose of the activity is utterly serious . The woman , Stephanie , 23 , is a volunteer for St John Ambulance and the bizarre -- but undoubtedly memorable -- sentences are her unique way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely . <p> Life-saver : Survival specialist Ray Mears found himself calling on his first-aid skills after the helicopter he was travelling in crashed <p> Of course , first aid never involves actually slapping faces but ' having a handy phrase that sticks in your mind helps you work under pressure , ' says Stephanie . ' And it 's far more likely to come to you if it 's funny or just a bit weird . ' <p> This basic manoeuvre forms a cornerstone of first-aid training : it keeps an unconscious casualty in a stable position , prevents their tongue from blocking their airway and can prevent fluids from choking them . <p> Survival expert Ray , who has practised first aid since he was a teenager , is having a refresher lesson , courtesy of three St John Ambulance youth workers . <p> The aim of the RISE project -- the name stands for respect , inspire , support and empower -- is to teach teenagers first-aid skills so they can go on to train other young people . Ray , 48 , is here today in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awards 2012 . <p> The lives of others : Ray Mears practises with teenagers from St John Ambulance in Eastbourne <p> Mail on Sunday readers still have a week left to nominate their first-aid heroes and the winners will be honoured at the Lancaster London Hotel in November . The awards , launched last year in association with The Mail on Sunday , seek to highlight those instances where first aid meant the difference between life and death . <p> Evidence suggests that up to 150,000 people die each year in circumstances where first aid could have helped . Almost 900 people a year choke to death , while 29,000 die from heart attacks . It is a subject Ray is passionate about . He says : ' Just knowing the basics can save a life . ' <p> He recalls the dramatic moment seven years ago when he was involved in a helicopter crash . If it had not been for his first-aid skills , the outcome could have been far more serious . He was filming Ray Mears Bushcraft for the BBC , exploring the dramatic landscape of Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameraman and the pilot were flying over a ridge to capture a shot of man riding a horse . But , heading downwind , the pilot had insufficient power to maintain height . <p> In safe hands : Ray Mears may be skilled in the wild but after enduring a helicopter accident , he is happy to receive refresher first-aid training from young St John Ambulance volunteers <p> The helicopter hit the ground . ' I went into the brace position and just hoped for the best , ' recalls Ray . ' I remember hearing the deafening sound of metal crunching , then everything went eerily silent . <p> ' I clambered out of a small opening thinking I was the only survivor , but I soon heard the cameraman shout , " I 'm alive but my legs are broken " from inside the helicopter . ' <p> Amazingly , Ray had suffered only severe bruising so ran to his colleague 's aid . ' He was in a bad way . His leg was so broken it formed a right-angle out to the side , ' says Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness that was keeping the cameraman in the helicopter and , thanks to the adrenaline pumping around his body , he lifted the 6ft 2in man to safety . <p> ' First aid can just be about being there for someone , which can prevent them going into shock , ' he says . ' I slowly moved the leg into a straighter position and made a makeshift splint out of gaffer tape and a camping mat . ' <p> It soon became apparent that every passenger had survived . Once everyone was away from the helicopter , Ray and the director noted down a list of the injuries . <p> ' I wanted to make sure that when I rang the emergency services , I would n't forget anything in a panic , ' says Ray . ' I wanted paramedics to be prepared because we came down in the middle of nowhere . I know most people are n't going to be in a helicopter crash but the same rules apply in everyday situations . ' <p> Indeed , the winners of the special SJA Guy Evans Award at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mail on Sunday -- were teenagers Michael Purvis and James Mavin , who came to the rescue of a man who had collapsed on the street . Realising he was not breathing , the pair gave him cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Paramedics said the boys ' actions ultimately saved the man 's life . <p> Ray says : ' To those who do not know basic first aid , think of your friends and family -- you never know when you are going to be that difference , that reason why a person does n't die . It just makes sense . '
