five world leaders ' favourite tv shows  1 . barack obama - homeland the leader of the free world is a former devotee of the wire , but now finds ironic escapism in terrorist drama homeland . " michelle goes out with the kids and they play tennis on a saturday afternoon , " obama has admitted . " i tell her i 'm going to work and then i go in my room and watch homeland . "  2 . david cameron - shameless man of the people dave apparently keeps it real with channel 4 's dose of low-brow sink-estate hyper-drama shameless . " shameless is quite addictive , " the pm has insisted , in perhaps his best defence against pomposity . but , apparently , only " because it 's so awful " . have cake . eat it . done .  3 . bill clinton - grey 's anatomy of the high-octane medical drama that he and his spouse can not miss , the former american president once said , " we both love grey 's anatomy and did 's 2008 presidential campaign began . "  4 . margaret thatcher - yes minister such was thatcher 's fondness for the eighties bbc comedy , that she co-wrote ( with her press secretary , bernard ingham ) and appeared in a four-minute sketch for the show , where she farcically discussed the abolition of economists . unsurprisingly , the sitcom was criticised for its pro-thatcherite undertones .  5 . kim jong-il - desperate housewives the late dictator had a surprising predilection for the gym-honed women of wisteria lane . in 2005 , abc - the american network that produces the show - was granted a visa to north korea , so that it could bring in the complete desperate housewives series on special request . of course , we 're not entirely sure that the network had any choice in the matter .
