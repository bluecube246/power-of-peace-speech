<h> Five world leaders ' favourite TV shows <p> 1 . Barack Obama - Homeland The leader of the free world is a former devotee of The Wire , but now finds ironic escapism in terrorist drama Homeland . " Michelle goes out with the kids and they play tennis on a Saturday afternoon , " Obama has admitted . " I tell her I 'm going to work and then I go in my room and watch Homeland . " <p> 2 . David Cameron - Shameless Man of the people Dave apparently keeps it real with Channel 4 's dose of low-brow sink-estate hyper-drama Shameless . " Shameless is quite addictive , " the PM has insisted , in perhaps his best defence against pomposity . But , apparently , only " because it 's so awful " . Have cake . Eat it . Done . <p> 3 . Bill Clinton - Grey 's Anatomy Of the high-octane medical drama that he and his spouse can not miss , the former American president once said , " We both love Grey 's Anatomy and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 2008 presidential campaign began . " <p> 4 . Margaret Thatcher - Yes Minister Such was Thatcher 's fondness for the Eighties BBC comedy , that she co-wrote ( with her press secretary , Bernard Ingham ) and appeared in a four-minute sketch for the show , where she farcically discussed the abolition of economists . Unsurprisingly , the sitcom was criticised for its pro-Thatcherite undertones . <p> 5 . Kim Jong-il - Desperate Housewives The late dictator had a surprising predilection for the gym-honed women of Wisteria Lane . In 2005 , ABC - the American network that produces the show - was granted a visa to North Korea , so that it could bring in the complete Desperate Housewives series on special request . Of course , we 're not entirely sure that the network had any choice in the matter .
