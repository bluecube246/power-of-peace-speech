' it made me feel incredibly proud of him '  discovery david neale , who has found out about his fathers life as a motorbike racer . picture : steve reid ( 122494-900 )  chris owen  all it took was a click of the mouse for david neale to find the father he never knew .  he was aware his dad had been an amateur international road racing motorcyclist , but that was about it .  mean machine john bacon in action  what he never knew was the high level at which he raced , the esteem in which he was held by the biking community and the man behind the leathers and helmet .  it was a frustration which meant the life of the 47-year-old was never really complete .  but that ended earlier this year when an aunt and cousin googled his dad 's name and up popped a picture and information about him .  ' it was the first time i 'd ever had any concrete details about him . i 'd searched the internet never had any luck , ' says david .  and that random search has now led to david and his sister linda being invited as guests of honour to a moving ceremony at the spot where their father died .  john bacon was just 31 when he died in a crash during a road race at tubbergen in the netherlands in 1965 . his sister linda was two and their mother , jean , was six months pregnant with david .  that post on the vintagebike.co.uk website was compiled by arthur west , an old racing friend and it enabled david to start piecing together details of his father 's life .  his discovered that , riding a norton , he finished 12th out of 41 in the lightweight bike class of the 1960 isle of man tt . he even beat the legendary mike hailwood who went on to become one of the few men to compete at grand prix level on motorcycles and in cars .  ' it was his first and only isle of man tt and the record shows that over the the course , his average speed was 76.19mph , ' says david , who took the name of his mother 's second husband when she remarried after his father 's death .  ' as a result of that website posting , linda asked for anyone who knew our father to contact us . we were anxious to find out at much as we could about him because my sister was only two and i was three months off being born when he died .  ' and out of the blue a chap called richard morley replied . he was my dad 's best friend . they 'd grown up together in woking . they both started on cycle speedway for the old woking jets before eventually taking up club , national and international motorcycle racing . ' richard went on to become the managing director of lotus europe .  that contact with richard led to an invitation from holland . it came from the tubbergen motorcycle racing club which wanted david , his sister and richard to be their guests in may at the unveiling of a memorial the annual tubbergen road race .  and one of the names on that memorial belongs to their father .  david , who lives with his wife emma and their two children at zeus lane , crookhorn , and is a long-distance lorry driver , adds : ' we 'd never met them before but they made us feel so welcome . we were treated like royalty .  ' the new track is only about 1.5km long and racing now takes place around what is really an industrial estate .  ' but when my father raced in 1965 the circuit was 10km long . the race went through three towns and in its heyday 60,000 spectators would watch the race .  ' it was the second most-watched motorcycling event behind assen where the dutch tt is held . the road racing stopped in the 1980s because of the traffic gridlock caused in surrounding town . '  all the family and friends of those killed at the circuit between 1954 and 1972 were taken on a coach tour of the circuit and shown the exact spot where , ' says david . ' about 100 vintage motorcycles and their riders became guards of honour for the coach which stopped for a minute 's silence as we passed the spot where each of the five died .  ' when it stopped where my dad died , my sister and i got off the coach and looked at the two roses we had planted there earlier -- one orange , one white -- that had been intertwined to represent our mother and father being at one again .  ' at that point the guard of honour bikes went past with some riders nodding , some saluting . it was an extremely poignant moment for both of us . '  but the links with his dashing father did not end there .  at the end of the day one of the dutch organisers of the event asked david if there was anything else he would like to do .  david adds with a gleam in his eye : ' i told him what it was and he said he would get it arranged . ' the ' he came back , passed me a helmet and leather jacket and i was taken as a pillion passenger on a suzuki 1000cc bike around the old tubbergen road race circuit .  ' we got up to some incredible speeds and i felt the thrill my father would have experienced .  ' i had walked in my father 's footsteps and it made me feel incredibly proud of him . '  ' it was going to be his last race '  john bacon had retired from competitive riding when he died on the tubbergen road circuit in holland .  david says : ' he wanted to ride one last time . it was going to be his last race . he had a two-year-old daughter and i was on the way . it turned out to be his very last ride , but not in the way he wanted . '  john , who did his national service in the raf , was a dental technician who moved to work in switzerland to fund his motorcycling exploits .  david says boyhood friend richard  ' apparently he even came up with the forerunner of steradent to clean dentures .
