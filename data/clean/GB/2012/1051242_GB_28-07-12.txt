<h> ' It made me feel incredibly proud of him ' <h> DISCOVERY David Neale , who has found out about his fathers life as a motorbike racer . Picture : Steve Reid ( 122494-900 ) <h> Chris Owen <p> All it took was a click of the mouse for David Neale to find the father he never knew . <p> He was aware his dad had been an amateur international road racing motorcyclist , but that was about it . <h> MEAN MACHINE John Bacon in action <p> What he never knew was the high level at which he raced , the esteem in which he was held by the biking community and the man behind the leathers and helmet . <p> It was a frustration which meant the life of the 47-year-old was never really complete . <p> But that ended earlier this year when an aunt and cousin Googled his dad 's name and up popped a picture and information about him . <p> ' It was the first time I 'd ever had any concrete details about him . I 'd searched the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any luck , ' says David . <p> And that random search has now led to David and his sister Linda being invited as guests of honour to a moving ceremony at the spot where their father died . <p> John Bacon was just 31 when he died in a crash during a road race at Tubbergen in the Netherlands in 1965 . His sister Linda was two and their mother , Jean , was six months pregnant with David . <p> That post on the vintagebike.co.uk website was compiled by Arthur West , an old racing friend and it enabled David to start piecing together details of his father 's life . <p> His discovered that , riding a Norton , he finished 12th out of 41 in the lightweight bike class of the 1960 Isle of Man TT . He even beat the legendary Mike Hailwood who went on to become one of the few men to compete at Grand Prix level on motorcycles and in cars . <p> ' It was his first and only Isle of Man TT and the record shows that over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course , his average speed was 76.19mph , ' says David , who took the name of his mother 's second husband when she remarried after his father 's death . <p> ' As a result of that website posting , Linda asked for anyone who knew our father to contact us . We were anxious to find out at much as we could about him because my sister was only two and I was three months off being born when he died . <p> ' And out of the blue a chap called Richard Morley replied . He was my dad 's best friend . They 'd grown up together in Woking . They both started on cycle speedway for the Old Woking Jets before eventually taking up club , national and international motorcycle racing . ' Richard went on to become the managing director of Lotus Europe . <p> That contact with Richard led to an invitation from Holland . It came from the Tubbergen Motorcycle Racing Club which wanted David , his sister and Richard to be their guests in May at the unveiling of a memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual Tubbergen road race . <p> And one of the names on that memorial belongs to their father . <p> David , who lives with his wife Emma and their two children at Zeus Lane , Crookhorn , and is a long-distance lorry driver , adds : ' We 'd never met them before but they made us feel so welcome . We were treated like royalty . <p> ' The new track is only about 1.5km long and racing now takes place around what is really an industrial estate . <p> ' But when my father raced in 1965 the circuit was 10km long . The race went through three towns and in its heyday 60,000 spectators would watch the race . <p> ' It was the second most-watched motorcycling event behind Assen where the Dutch TT is held . The road racing stopped in the 1980s because of the traffic gridlock caused in surrounding town . ' <p> All the family and friends of those killed at the circuit between 1954 and 1972 were taken on a coach tour of the circuit and shown the exact spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says David . ' About 100 vintage motorcycles and their riders became guards of honour for the coach which stopped for a minute 's silence as we passed the spot where each of the five died . <p> ' When it stopped where my dad died , my sister and I got off the coach and looked at the two roses we had planted there earlier -- one orange , one white -- that had been intertwined to represent our mother and father being at one again . <p> ' At that point the guard of honour bikes went past with some riders nodding , some saluting . It was an extremely poignant moment for both of us . ' <p> But the links with his dashing father did not end there . <p> At the end of the day one of the Dutch organisers of the event asked David if there was anything else he would like to do . <p> David adds with a gleam in his eye : ' I told him what it was and he said he would get it arranged . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He came back , passed me a helmet and leather jacket and I was taken as a pillion passenger on a Suzuki 1000cc bike around the old Tubbergen road race circuit . <p> ' We got up to some incredible speeds and I felt the thrill my father would have experienced . <p> ' I had walked in my father 's footsteps and it made me feel incredibly proud of him . ' <p> ' It was going to be his last race ' <p> John Bacon had retired from competitive riding when he died on the Tubbergen road circuit in Holland . <p> David says : ' He wanted to ride one last time . It was going to be his last race . He had a two-year-old daughter and I was on the way . It turned out to be his very last ride , but not in the way he wanted . ' <p> John , who did his national service in the RAF , was a dental technician who moved to work in Switzerland to fund his motorcycling exploits . <p> David says boyhood friend Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' Apparently he even came up with the forerunner of Steradent to clean dentures .
