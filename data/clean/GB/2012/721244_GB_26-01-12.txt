<h> When the Big Boss takes over : The rise of female bullies Dolly Bindra and Pooja Misrra <p> Her loud and intimidating presence is her main claim to fame . It was Dolly Bindra 's bossiness and instant name-calling that made her the most popular contestant of Bigg Boss Season 4 . <p> Bindra did n't hesitate to shout or abuse others and even resorted to emotional blackmail when it suited her . <p> Pooja Misrra was quick to follow Bindra 's suit in the recently concluded season , and became the new female bully , the woman who intimidates people to get her way with them . <p> Dolly Bindra did n't hesitate to shout or abuse others and even resorted to emotional blackmail when it suited her on the show <p> Her eyes flash , her voice is loud and haranguing , she stands arms akimbo , in your face , full body thrust , challenging . Her game is intimidation to get what she wants , to be heard and to block out others . <p> The universal pattern of female bullies is visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggressively grabbing what it wants . <p> The whole gamut : the ' kali ' -eyed women of the saas bahu serials who stride around to thundering music ; the subtly overpowering Desperate Housewives ; Tanu who weds Manu ; the raging rough queens of politics ; the haranguing feminist groups ' fighting ' for women 's rights . <p> Women who clamour for attention through their own victimhood are equally bullying . For example , the miserable , sacrificing , widowed , sewing-machine wielding , TB stricken mother of old Hindi movies who controlled outcomes of when her sons and daughters would eat and who they could go out with . <p> DEEPLY INGRAINED IN OUR PSYCHE <p> Numerous examples come to mind when I think ' female bullies ' and the diverse ways in which women misuse this force . It makes me wonder if women have swung from inhabiting one stereotype to another . Has the doormat woman , in her search for the self , transformed into the vicious bully ? <p> Or is it that she always existed , as an exaggerated expression of self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what it takes to achieve what she wants ? <p> Pooja Misrra was quick to follow Bindra 's suit in the recently concluded season , and became the new female bully , the woman who intimidates people to get her way with them <p> Deeply implanted in the psyche of Indian society are the timeless energies of Mahabharata and Ramayana which also include Kaikayi as a key player in the form of the Machiavellian wife who used all she had , including boons of gratitude to twist things in her favour . Is there a female bully in your home ? <p> Is there one in you ? When I asked people this question , they had no stories to tell about themselves or bosses , wives , sisters , making me wonder if this was a secret that no one wanted to talk about ? <p> Is it because the men do n't want to admit that the women boss them around ? As for the women , is it that they do n't want to accept that the one they call a ' Bitch ' laughingly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to ? <p> A LEGACY OF BULLYING <p> As an older sister of three brothers I grew up bossing them . When I could not win with words , I beat them physically until they outgrew me physically . <p> Yes , I am an erstwhile bully . As a little girl I had figured out what made my whole world tick . Being witty got me what I needed from dad , even if it meant going against my mother 's wishes . Jealous of my younger , angelic-looking brother , I made it my life 's agenda to make him pay for being born . <p> The easiest way to do that was to become the focus of everyone 's attention and throw into the mix hitting , pinching , tale telling . As I got older , I learned to use ignoring and viciousness as my tools . <p> I was a bullying girl without realising it . I schemed , calculated and manipulated to get what I wanted , no matter what . Today I look back on my life journey -- a marriage , motherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of my relationships have been skewed . Two thirds of my life has been about aggression -- either dishing it out or receiving it . <p> I would either bully or be bullied . I was helpless in the clutches of this need within me for extreme expressions of anger . <p> WORKING IT OUT <p> Psychologists say that at the core of every bully is a fearful child . Bullying can only stop when we are ready to acknowledge our power , ignore the ' fearful child ' and confront the bully in ourselves , and her dynamicshow she creeps up on her when we insist on our way -- directly or insidiously ? <p> Also , what do we as women or as victims of female bullying toward us and toward men , want to do about it ? What are our options when we come face to face with the bullying woman ? <p> Do we quietly go along with whatever she wants or ignore her and do what is ok by us ? The answers are different for each of us . <p> Every individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 50 , I am pleased to say that I have worked that bully out of my system . <p> I have grown up . I no longer have any need to abuse my power or give it away to anyone else . These healing years have , however , been tinged with remorse at my past behaviour . When my brother jokes with me and says ' We are scared for life , ' I am reminded that as his bullying older sister , I must have something to do with his childhood perceptions of how harsh the world is . <p> Would this perception not have impacted his life and his relationships ? Has he been in other relationships where the dynamics have been the same -- where he has felt helpless in the face of overt or subtle domineering ? Only he knows the answer . <h> Your little princess may be a bully after all <p> She may not shout , throw tantrums or come home with torn clothes like her brother . But this does n't mean that your little princess ca n't knock someone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially common among girls at all female institutions . <p> ' Bullying is generally considered a manly trait and girls bully each other less in co-ed schools as they are keen to show their feminine qualities . <p> School counsellors and educators say that bullying is especially common among girls at all female institutions <p> Female bullying is mostly verbal- mocking at their classmates ' clothes , height , complexion and weight , for instance . <p> Girls who do n't get their eyebrows plucked , hands and legs waxed or who prefer knee length socks over ankle length ones are the ' easy targets ' . <h> CYBER BULLYING NEEDS TACKLING <p> Described as the use of the Internet , cell phones , or other devices to transmit text or images to hurt or embarrass another person , cyberbullying is on the rise among kids in India , according to a poll conducted by global research firm Ipsos : Three out of ten Indian parents report that their children have been victims , and the problem is bigger in India than in the West . Social networking sites like Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular devices . <p> Like in the U.S. , the number of suicides due to cyberbullying is also on the rise and the Union home ministry has asked state governments and police forces tobe vigilant about cyber offenders . <p> Apart from verbal ridicule , snatching money and lunch boxes from others or getting them to do their schoolwork are the other forms that bullying can take . <p> This trait of dominating and threatening others through mockery or hitting starts at a young age but is dismissed by people , who justify this behaviour by calling it ' smart ' and ' bold . ' <p> ' Unlike the West , the attitude in India is quite different . Indian parents hate admitting that their child could be a bully , ' points out Dr Merchant . But this can become a serious problem . <p> ' Parents and teachers often shrug off such behaviour as a teenage problem that will subside naturally . Counsellors are approached only when the situation spirals out of hand , ' says Khosla . <p> Bullying is a reflection of deep rooted problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullying others is a way of covering up her own insecurities and jealousy , ' says Khosla . <p> Getting to the cause of the problem is essential . ' A missing sense of empathy from parents makes some girls laugh at others ' shortcomings . <p> ' Kids need to learn to accept others better instead of putting them down , ' says Dr Merchant . Parents need to develop an open relationship with their daughters , be aware of what 's happening at school and what her friendships mean to her . <p> ' Communicate freely with your child . If she says she is being bullied , listen to her . Do n't dismiss complaints about your daughter from school or other kids ' parents casually either , ' says Dr Merchant .
