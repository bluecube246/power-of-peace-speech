Clearly this behaviour is highly reckless and dangerous . <p> -- Phil Verster , route managing director for Network Rail <p> In one instance , a man was caught on camera lifting the barriers , to run across the tracks . <p> One man was caught on CCTV lifting the barrier Credit : Network Rail <p> Network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the crossings at High Street and Brayford Wharf . <p> Much level crossing misuse results from people not thinking about the risks but we believe frustration caused by the location of the crossings is also a factor in Lincoln . The crossings here are already the highest possible safety design so we needed a pragmatic , joint effort to further reduce the risk of misuse .
