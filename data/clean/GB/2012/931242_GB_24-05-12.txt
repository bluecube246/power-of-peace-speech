There have been several incidents of pedestrians who have still been on the tracks , as the barriers are lowered around them .  They have now released CCTV pictures highlighting the number of people trying to cross when it 's not safe .  Rail bosses say the problem is particularly bad at two crossings in Lincoln City Centre .
