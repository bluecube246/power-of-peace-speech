<h> Pinterest is a digital corkboard that shows other people what like from around the internet . Here 's how to create an account and use the website . <h> Step-by-step guide to the new online pinboard <p> Facebook and Twitter are obvious ways of sharing things on the web that you like , as of course is a personal blog or website . But there 's now a new way of sharing your favourite web items . Pinterest is a digital corkboard that shows other people what you rate , what looks cute or appeals from a design or engineering point of view . <p> If you 're an avid user of all things Google , Gmail , Picasa , Blogger and YouTube , sharing items via Google+ may seem a more obvious option , while newshounds may prefer Digg . Pinterest offers a different slant , in which peer ratings are important . You indicate your admiration of other pinners ' taste in items on the web by having them on your Pinterest boards and following them , if you wish . Unlike Twitter , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop off the radar , pinned items stay on your page , ready for other people to delve into . <p> As with most social media websites , tags are at the heart of Pinterest . Having a decent photo or two also helps pique other peoples ' interest . The site is based around interest boards that you contribute to , create and share , and Pinterest provides a selection of popular topic boards to get you started . The more ' pins ' a site or a Pinterest user acquires , the higher their Pinterest ranking . To see what 's popular , check out the ' Popular ' link on the Pinterest home page . It could n't be simpler . <p> You can follow or unfollow any Pinterest member you wish , just as you can with Twittter . If you 've linked your Pinterest account with Facebook rather than Twitter , it 's ' Likes ' that you 're after . <p> Pinterest is nominally still an invite-only beta website . Yet , it has more than 12 million members and - in the US - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinterest in March noted that UK usage is currently weighted the other way ; male users have embraced it . <p> Pinterest originally invited craft and fashion bloggers to try out the service when it was in closed beta and there 's still a big focus on homespun choices such as family , home , DIY &amp; crafts , fashion and cooking and the boards Pinterest suggests reflect this . More ' male ' interests such as technology , cars and science are listed at the bottom of the initial home page , out of sight until you scroll down . You can add your own Pinterest category ; the default list is rather safe . <p> As the site develops and new members with different interests join , these listings will change . As with all things social on the web , from Digg to YouTube to Twitter , Pinterest is user-driven and is shaped by members ' likes . What makes it more than of fleeting interest in that , unlike Twitter , it 's not ephemeral . What you pin is a public , permanently accessible log of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just hope Google does n't find a way of monetising such a concept and tracking what we view and pin for the benefit of ad traffickers everywhere . <h> How to get started with Pinterest <p> 1 . Request a login at Pinterest.com or accept an invitation from a friend . Your email address and a password are all you need . Click on any of the preset interest boards you wish and follow any that look particularly interesting . The Find friends option under your Account photo is a good starting point for finding and sharing pins with like-minded Facebook and email friends . <p> 2 . To start interacting on Pinterest it 's easiest to add a bookmark for each of your boards in your web browser . These are actually bookmarklets - tiny applications that allow you to add items to your Pinterest stash just by clicking on them when you stumble across something interesting on the web . In Safari and Chrome , for example , you just drag the Pin It bookmark to the bookmark bar . <p> 3 . Another useful tool native to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to browsing Pinterest boards due to their visual appeal and the way they seamlessly lead on to each other . If you want to find something specific -- attractive business card ideas , for example -- head straight for Search . Bear this in mind when tagging and naming your own pins . <p> 4 . If you find something you like on someone else 's board , click to ' repin ' it and add it to yours . This also has the effect of raising the item 's profile and that of its original ' pinner ' . You can also share Likes and links via Twitter and Facebook by optionally sharing your repin . <p> 5 . Click Pinners you follow at the top of the screen to see the latest updates from them . You can curate your own Pinterest boards too . Click on something you like . If it does n't fit neatly into one of the boards you 're following , scroll down to the bottom of the Repin menuand click in the field to create one of your own . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share items you like and have stumbled across -- you need to pin original items . Pinterest etiquette dictates that the original pinner gets credit for repins . Click the Add button next to your profile , choose Add a pin and then copy the pertinent page link . You can also upload images . A good photo and description will help ensure your pin is found . <p> 7 . Videos as well as photos can be shared on Pinterest . Channels for each are listed at the top of the page . You can also use Pinterest to market your products ( be wary of overpromotion so you are n't deemed a spammer ) and to showcase your own talents to potential employees . Items for sale are listed under Gifts by rough price range . Note that when you type in a figure and it will appear in US dollars . <p> 8 . Cute works well on Pinterest , but it also works well for spammers . As with any website , you should be wary of the links you click on . We clicked on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgy photos and phishing are rare , but Pinterest provides a reporting tool for these and spam to the right of each entry . <p> 9 . Once you 're following a few pinners and have several boards , it can be hard to keep up with the additions to Pinterest . For desktop use , Pinterest is easy enough to control via your web page . On the road , a smartphone app is ideal for uploading and sharing pins . There 's a free Pinterest app for iOS plus a handful of third-party ones , while Android and Windows Phone users can use Pinsensation.
