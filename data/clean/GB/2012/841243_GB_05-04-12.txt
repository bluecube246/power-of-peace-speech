<h> Riot victim 's father Tariq Jahan guilty of attack charge <p> A man who called for calm after his son died in the Birmingham riots has been found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm in an earlier attack . <p> Tariq Jahan broke a man 's jaw when he punched him last July in Handsworth . <p> Jahan , 46 , told Birmingham Crown Court he acted in self defence and was cleared of causing GBH with intent . <p> The judge said Jahan deserved to be sent to jail but gave him a suspended sentence owing to his public appeal for calm during the August riots . <h> ' Extraordinary position ' <p> Jahan 's son Haroon was one of three men who died in Winson Green during the riots in Birmingham . <p> Sentencing judge William Davis QC said : " People who break people 's jaws in this kind of mindless violence normally go to prison but I take a view that because of his extraordinary position it is right to suspend sentence . " <p> Jahan was given a 12-month sentence suspended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours unpaid service and to pay ? 1,000 compensation to Sajjad Ali , the man he punched . <p> The court heard how Jahan had been driving along Factory Road in July and had beeped his horn at a van blocking his route . <h> Headbutting claim <p> Mr Ali , 34 , had been standing by the roadside speaking to the van driver and mouthed something aggressively to Jahan , who was accompanied by his wife . <p> Jahan told the jury he got out of the car to speak to Mr Ali to try to resolve the situation . <p> He then admitted hitting Mr Ali who he claimed had headbutted him first . <p> Mr Ali disputed that version of events . <p> He claimed Jahan became aggressive because he accused Mr Ali of staring at his wife . <p> Mr Ali told the court Jahan said : " Oi , why you staring at me ? " before he climbed out of his car and accused him of " staring at my missus " . <p> Mr Ali 's jaw was fractured in two places and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jahan must have used " moderate to severe " force to inflict those injuries . <p> Jurors on Thursday accepted that Jahan 's did not intend to seriously harm Mr Ali on 6 July , 2011 . <h> ' Genuine public service ' <p> A month later Jahan 's 21-year-old son Haroon and two friends , brothers Shazad Ali , 30 , and Abdul Musavir , 31 , were struck by a car during disorder in Winson Green as riots spread across England . <p> All three were declared dead in hospital and hailed as heroes who died protecting homes and shops from looters . <p> Within hours of Haroon 's death Jahan addressed a group of youths outside his home and appealed for them to " calm down " , end the disorder and " go home " . <p> Addressing Jahan directly on Thursday the judge said his actions in August were a " genuine public service " . <p> He said in the aftermath of his son 's death Jahan 's actions " probably prevented really serious disorder continuing in Birmingham . " <p> He told Jahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events . For that reason and that reason alone I can suspend the sentence . "
