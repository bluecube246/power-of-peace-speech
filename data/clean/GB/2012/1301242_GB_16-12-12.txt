<h> Shetland pony takes a ride on Berlin subway <p> The Shetland pony taking a ride on the Berlin subway ( Picture : Subway ) <p> Commuters in Berlin got the fright of their lives last week when a woman boarded a subway train with her Shetland pony . <p> Footage of the unidentified blonde woman leading the pony onto Berlin 's S-Bahn subway and enjoying a ride together has been uploaded onto YouTube , where one clip has been watched almost a quarter of a million times . <p> Jarkko Riihimaki , one of the passengers who witness the bizarre event , is quoted by the Daily Mail as saying : ' This was supposed to be a normal trip home with the S-Bahn . <p> ' After one stop , a girl -- pretty conventional looking -- comes in with a pony . Yes , with a pony ! <p> ' I do n't know what to say about the whole thing . ' <p> The video on YouTube shows the well-behaved pony calmly standing in the carriage as its owner sits in silence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal , while some try to capture the unique commute on their mobile phones . <p> While internet users have reacted with joy at the clip , S-Bahn spokesman Burkhard Ahlert was less than impressed . <p> ' One may smile but according to our transport regulations , this is clearly not allowed , ' he said . <p> ' This clearly violates our conditions of carriage . <p> ' A horse can be dangerous . What if it escapes ? The S-Bahn is no place for such animals . <p> ' We have informed the police already . ' <p> It is though the pony may belong to a local circus group that collects charitable donations .
