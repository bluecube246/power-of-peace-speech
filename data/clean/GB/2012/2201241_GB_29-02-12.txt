A Letter From... Northern Ireland #7
http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/a-letter-from-northern-ireland-7

Popular Festivals  This has been yet another exciting month in Northern Ireland ... let 's kick things off with some brand spanking new emerging talent . First off the bat is the offering from former Front Woman of No Mean City , Jilly St John .  Jilly returns to her rawking roots with her new venture the aptly named Wyldling . Hot off the press Wyldling is much in its early stages but St John and " Friends " which the act consist of have already offered the online world a taste of some pretty promising tunes . The initial stand out track for me is ' Waiting on Water ' which holds one hell of a catchy chorus . The track which holds an unmistakable guitar solo slotted in between the echoing raw vocals of St John , shows just how far the front woman has come from her No Mean City days .  It is hard to define which genre exactly Wyldling fits into , but one thing 's for certain NI will be hearing a lot about them for the rest with one EP , Barbara from the very talented Best Boy Grip . The hype surrounding Best Boy Grip is not unjustified , as the first thing that springs to mind when listening to this EP is to put it simply , that it is pure listening pleasure for the ears . Barbara is just pure melodic genius and personally it 's been a long time since I have heard such an inviting EP , from any artist . The EP is filled with beautiful lyrics " My heart stops beating when I hear you speak " , which can be somewhat comical at times " you 're the one that feeds me honey from the hive " are just infectious from start to finish . Stand out track for myself on this EP has to be the title track Barbara , with its beautiful upbeat and pure fun vibe . This is one artist that I see going from strength to strength .  Next up on the scene we have A Plastic Rose who will be releasing their much anticipated new single on March 19th , under the Di one hell of a start by supporting the legendary NI act , Snow Patrol in London 's O2 arena and Belfast 's Odyssey arena , both of which were sold out shows . Gary Lightbody who sought out the band himself in a local venue , in Belfast was impressed enough to add them to the Snow Patrol tour support . The first single from the album which is rumoured to being released in September 2012 , is none other than ' Build From The Ground Up ' . The track starts with an orchestral feel before going fast into A Plastic Roses own take on alternative rock , which takes me vastly back to the nineties . A band hotly tipped not to be missed , I would recommend keeping an eye out for the rest of these guys singles in the run up to their already much talked about new album .  One band that I can not fail to mention that has been buzzing all over Northern Ireland recently is the crazily upbeat , Wonder Villains . The band who hail from Derry-Londonderry are in one word indie , the Wonder Villains could be described as none other than a refreshing change . Popular track is the highly cheerful ' Zola ' with its zesty and infectious catchy fun filled pop feel . A band who are as bubbly in their music as they are on stage , if you like that sort of thing and fancy a change they would get my vote as a band to go check out .  That is it in the way of bands and EP 's for now but when it comes to NI , it is most definitely a scene that never sleeps . If your around in the next month are so these are my tips for gigs to go check out .  New Noise events will be bringing all of Northern Irelands hottest acts to two venues in Derry-Londonderry , Masons bar and the Nerve Centre . Next up is More than Conquers , Dutch Shultz and Droids on the 30th March , a club night where all the cool kids will be for sure . One gig I am truly excited about though is Radar Belfast , with In case of Fire , Before Machines and firm favourites , Like Statues .  If like me you ca n't wait until next time for your guide to what to listen to in Northern Ireland , local Belfast Radio station Blast 106 promote what 's new in local music every Wednesday on Through the Wall 7pm to 9pm.
