more than one million people will be supplied with water from britain 's first large-scale desalination plant this summer to help cope with what is expected to be a widespread drought .  within weeks , the new ? 270million plant in east london will begin supplying homes with seawater that has been turned into drinking water .  more than 20million people are facing hosepipe bans after seven water companies announced restrictions earlier this week . householders could be fined up to ? 1,000 for filling a paddling pool or washing their car .  water companies yesterday faced calls to invest in reducing leaks instead of imposing water restrictions on home owners . according to official figures , the companies are losing 3.4billion litres of water a year to leaks , equivalent to 25 per cent of all water used . thames water admitted that its last hosepipe ban , imposed in 2006 , resulted in just a 5 per cent drop in water use .  ann robinson , the director of consumer policy at uswitch , said : " i accept we have is the incredible amount of leakage . " families face an average price rise for water of 6 per cent to ? 376 per year from april , just before the hosepipe ban comes in . southern water , which missed its leak targets last year , is raising prices by more than 8 per cent .  martin baggs , the chief executive of thames water , warned that prices would have to rise even further to build reservoirs and new technology .  he said : " people must use less water during extreme conditions or we have got to have extra resources so people do n't have to have those restrictions . " his company built the desalination plant in beckton , which will produce 150 million litres every day .  the plant works by taking water from the river at low tide , filtering it and then pumping it through a membrane perforated by millions of minute holes . the water produced is so clean that beneficial minerals have to be put back into it . but the process is extremely costly and energy intensive .
