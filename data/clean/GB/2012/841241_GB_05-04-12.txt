<h> Double Cross : The True Story of the D-Day Spies , By Ben Macintyre <p> After the Second World War , a Catalan former chicken-farmer named Juan Pujol retired to Venezuela , where he taught Spanish to Shell staff and ran a bookshop . This literary destiny seems more than apt . Between 1942 and 1945 , while living in a nondescript semi in Hendon with a disgruntled wife and a dull cover job at the BBC , Pujol -- " Agent Garbo " to his real controllers at MI5 -- contributed several decisive chapters to perhaps the most spectacularly effective work of fiction in modern history . <p> Together with his double-agent colleagues , some of whose stories Ben Macintyre weaves into the latest of his enjoyable and engrossing books about wartime subterfuge and deception , Garbo fashioned a " limitless , multi-character , ever-expanding novel " . It was designed to deceive the Germans about every aspect of the preparations for D-Day . From 1942 , every " German " source in Britain worked for the Allies , with the bizarre multi-national band of Double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dry , cricket-fanatic chief John Masterman . <p> By June 1944 , when the double-crossers achieved what Macintyre calls their " world-changing triumph " , Operation Fortitude had managed to persuade the German high command that the Normandy landings were merely " a starter before the main course " . That , the Wehrmacht believed with " unshakeable " conviction , would take the form of a massive invasion of the Pas de Calais across the narrowest point of the Channel by an ( entirely fictional ) First US Army Group under General Patton , with side-order attacks aimed at Norway and the Atlantic coast around Bordeaux . <p> Did this intricate tissue of fibs help to win the war ? The military evidence looks compelling . A month after D-Day , 22 German divisions were still held back from the Normandy front . An order to move the formidable 1st Panzer Division there was rescinded specifically because Garbo , in his florid " rococo " despatches , warned that Normandy would be a diversion . <p> Some historians remain sceptical about the value of Second World War deception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Front crumbling and the German officer elite in near-open revolt against Hitler , the D-Day forces would have prevailed without the rich diet of disinformation fed to Berlin by the agents . Writers about espionage ( Macintyre included ) feel a natural affinity for keyboard warriors who spin colourful yarns that command assent , and tend to overegg their tasty pudding . <p> In spite of these caveats , Garbo and his deeply eccentric colleagues undoubtedly saved countless lives . In his history of D-Day , the level-headed Antony Beevor writes that Fortitude " proved more effective than the Alllies had ever dared imagine " . Macintyre 's gripping yarns may bring no major revisions to our map of the secret war : Joshua Levine 's book on Fortitude appeared only last year . But they do show with captivating panache the debt that Allied victory owed to these oddball storytellers , who wove around the actual army that liberated Europe a " bodyguard of lies " . <p> In addition to Garbo , Macintyre traces the flights of fantasy foisted on their German handlers by Dusko Popov ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by Elvira de la Fuente Chaudoir ( " Bronx " ) , the bisexual Peruvian socialite and gambler ; by Lily Sergeyev ( " Treasure " ) , the volatile French-Russian agent who almost scuppered Fortitude because the British terminated her beloved dog Babs ; and by the Polish undercover specialist Roman Czerniawski ( " Brutus " ) , a tough pro among this cast of high-maintenance amateur primadonnas . <p> But did the Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) really swallow all the fabrications that MI5 's shadow warriors fed them , prudently mixed with non-essential truth ? As Macintyre 's tale unfolds , we come to ask how much this notoriously " disloyal " weak link in the Nazi chain tacitly connived in strategic blunders that would hasten the downfall of the Reich . Messages intercepted at Bletchley Park by the Enigma code-breakers prove that Garbo and friends apparently retained their kudos and credibility until D-Day and beyond . However , a suspicion remains that anti-Nazi officers -- right up to Alexis von Roenne , who digested and presented intelligence for Hitler - had rumbled the Double Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its splendidly weird ploys and feints ( spy-pigeons figure frequently ) , Macintyre 's book culminates in a stirring account of old-fashioned courage . " Worldly , cynical , dissolute " , the German case-officer Johnny Jebsen - Popov 's handler - was a louche playboy , high-society fraudster and PG Wodehouse fan . Always covertly anti-Nazi , he had been " turned " by MI5 in 1943 . In April 1944 , Jebsen was kidnapped in Lisbon and spirited to Berlin . It seems that anti-Hitler officers feared he might unwittingly derail their plans to kill the F ? hrer . <p> Once in the capital , though , pro-regime interrogators took charge . He was taken to the Gestapo prison . On the eve of D-Day , Jebsen -- whom everyone assumed would instantly crack and squeal -- could have wrecked Fortitude . Yet , reduced by weeks of torture and maltreatment to a just-living skeleton , he said not a single word . Macintyre salutes the astonishing bravery of a hedonist-turned-hero . And this ramifying network of improbable , often comic , fraud and fiction reaches its fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- broken in body , but not in spirit - who clung at death 's door to the Code of the Woosters : " Never let a pal down " .
