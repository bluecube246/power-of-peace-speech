End of an era as Choucas announces closure  Legendary Chamonix nightclub closes its doors  Looking For Something ?  After almost 70 years at the heart of the Chamonix apres-ski scene Le Choucas has accounced that it will not open this winter .  First opening its doors in 1943 , Le Choucas has shown generations of us how to master the art of skiing all day and partying all night , then getting up the next day to do it all over again .  Le Choucas has welcomed visitors from all over the world into its authentically Alpine-style wooden chalet , to enjoy a taste of classic Chamonix apres-ski with live bands playing during the early evenings followed by resident DJ Phil " The Bull " Garner packing out the dancefloor until 5am . Marketing itself as a " night-pub " it charged no entry fee and was a staple part of many a night out once all other venues had closed at 2am .  The reason given for the closure is that local authorities have responded to complaints from residents regarding it has been operating as a nightclub for longer than most residents have been on this planet it seems a bit of a drastic measure , so perhaps there are other factors that have not been made public .  The ever-reliable Chamonix rumour mills report that the premises will be turned into a clothes shop , brand yet to be confirmed .  The devastating aftermath of the demise of Choucas was made shockingly apparent last night when hoards of late-night revellers were refused entry to Le Tof and Amnesia , due to overcrowding . RIP Le Choucas , you will be missed .
