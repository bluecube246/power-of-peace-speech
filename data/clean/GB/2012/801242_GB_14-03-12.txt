<h> The fallout of the phone-hacking scandal could increase the culture of secrecy at Scotland Yard because of potential whistleblowers being prevented from speaking to the Press , the Leveson Inquiry has been told . <p> Scotland Yard was described as a " secretive " organisation which has clamped down on junior officers talking to the media.Photo : CHRISTOPHER PLEDGER <p> Sandra Laville , crime correspondent for the Guardian newspaper , said an " over-reaction " to the crisis had led to a clampdown on all but the most senior officers talking to journalists . <p> In a statement to the Inquiry , Miss Laville said that as a result : " Any officer meeting a journalist to make them aware of a pressing issue within the police ... to highlight racism , corruption or incompetence , is at risk of a criminal investigation and a disciplinary hearing . " <p> The Metropolitan Police has come in for repeated criticism over its close relationship with News International , and in January a report by Elizabeth Filkin , the former parliamentary commissioner for standards , suggested that reporters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report also called for " more open and impartial " provision of information to the public , but Miss Laville said its recommendations were likely to have " the opposite effect " . <p> She said one recommendation in the report , that all leaks to journalists should automatically be the subject of a criminal investigation , " could be seen as criminalising informal contacts between the police and journalists " which are vital for holding the police to account . <p> " It is not enough that the flow of information from a police force is controlled by senior officers and their management board , who are driven by the need to protect the corporate image of the police force , " she added . <p> Miss Laville cited the case of Kirk Reid , a serial rapist who was finally jailed for life in 2009 following years of incompetence by the Met , which had failed to bring him to justice earlier despite dozens of women being attacked by him for almost a decade . <p> The Met had chosen not to highlight the case -- which eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission -- and it was only because an individual police officer tipped off the media that it came to be reported . <p> Miss Laville said that in the current climate , the officer who tipped her off about the Reid case would be liable to criminal prosecution even though he was acting " in the public interest " by ensuring the Met 's failures were brought to light . <p> Junior officers " are already refusing to talk to journalists " , she said : " Because there is now a growing culture of fear within Scotland Yard that if they do so they will be subjected to a criminal investigation , and/or sacked . " <p> She pointed out that it was senior officers and managers , not middle and lower-ranking officers , who were criticised for their " cosy " relationships with newspaper executives , yet the Met 's response has been to give the senior officers and managers even more power . <p> She cited the example of Sir Robert Mark , who faced a corruption scandal in the 1970s and responded by telling rank and file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full support , to ensure corruption would be quickly exposed in future , and suggested he had struck " the right balance " .
