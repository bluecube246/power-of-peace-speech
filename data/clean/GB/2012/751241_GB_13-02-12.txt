<h> Court chaos follows interpreter change <p> Image caption The agency admitted there had been some ' teething troubles ' <p> The government is hoping to save ? 18m a year by changing how interpreters are provided for court hearings - but it is said the new system is causing chaos and costly delays . <p> A suspect charged with perverting the course of justice is told they are accused of being a pervert . Another is told that being charged means they have to give the police money . Two incidents cited by those opposed to the new system . <p> Courts in England and Wales previously hired freelance interpreters from a national register . Now they are provided by a single agency , Applied Language Solutions ( ALS ) , which has promised to cut the annual ? 60m translation bill by a third . <p> While the company says despite some " teething troubles " it is operating well , 60% of the 2,300 of those on the National Register of Public Service Interpreters are refusing to work for it after their pay was slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 , a quarter-hourly rate after three hours , and were paid for travel time and expenses - but this has been replaced by hourly fees in three tiers of ? 16 , ? 20 and ? 22 plus no travel time and reduced expenses . <p> In some cases , an interpreter 's pay would be halved for the same three hours of work , while those who used to travel long distances to assignments could be out of pocket . <p> For example , one Lithuanian interpreter who regularly travelled to Devon from Surrey and used to get ? 246 for a day 's shift would now be ? 65 down after travel costs . <h> Specialised job <p> Some fear the change could have more damaging consequences . The interpreters ' membership body , the Professional Interpreters Alliance , says the boycott is forcing ALS to employ people with little experience of the legal system . <p> " We are already hearing horror stories from all over the country . Being a court interpreter is a specialised and difficult job . You have to be accurate as people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> There is a huge demand for interpreters to help defendants , witnesses and victims understand the legal system . <h> Case study - solicitor <p> I represented a Polish Roma woman who was attending for the second time . She speaks no English at all . <p> On the first occasion , no one had thought to arrange an interpreter , although one had been provided police station , and her case had to be adjourned . <p> Shortly after I arrived at court the usher showed me a fax from the court office indicating that the interpreter organisation could not provide a Polish interpreter at all . <p> As the chairman of the bench remarked , we could probably find several on the High Street . <p> Fortunately , the defendant had brought a cousin who spoke English . <p> John Storer , a solicitor for a firm in Boston , Lincolnshire , says 20% of the local population are migrant workers , meaning 20/25% of his clients do not speak English . " We rely on interpreters for cases from murder to motoring offences , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of February , solicitors , translators and magistrates across England and Wales have reported numerous cases of interpreters failing to attend , not speaking the right language and not accurately translating proceedings . <p> In one case , a Lithuanian man was in custody for theft on a Monday , but as no interpreter was present he was remanded without a bail application as his solicitor simply could not get any information from him . He was eventually dealt with on a third occasion , a week later . <p> One of the PIA interpreters listened to part of the interpreting during the cross-examination of the defendant and the closing speeches in a case at a crown court , which they described as " very vague and incomplete " . <p> They reported : " I would say one fifth of what was being said in court was interpreted to the defendant . At one stage the interpreter , instead of interpreting what the judge was saying , was telling the defendant that she thought the judge was nice and sympathetic towards the defendant 's case . " <h> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the West London bench of magistrates , said the cost of sending defendants back to custody when interpreters failed to show could mean the change was a false economy . <p> " I had a case where the interpreter did n't turn up and I was stuck between a rock and a hard place . It 's not right to proceed when the chap does n't really understand what 's going on , but it 's also not very just or fair on him to put it off for another day and leave him sitting in a cell overnight while we get an interpreter , " he said . <p> " On top of that there are all the other agencies , because it 's not just the defendant , it 's the police , the probation , the defence , the CPS ; they are all incurring costs because there 's no interpreter there . " <p> Rebecca Niblock , a solicitor specialising in extradition cases , said it could pose problems for the justice system further down the line . <p> " There is inevitably bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , not just in court but in speaking to their lawyers . It 's not just their presence that is required but their input , whether they are pleading guilty or not guilty - if there 's any uncertainty over what 's said that leaves the door open to appeals . " <p> We are closely monitoring the service , will investigate any complaints made ALS spokeswoman <p> Mr Storer said his firm would employ freelance interpreters using Legal Aid money if it was not satisfied with the standard of ALS interpreters . <p> " Good interpreters save money as can speed things up , they are fully aware of the legal process , they know exactly what to do and what 's expected of them and they just get things done , " he said . <p> Mike Jones , Chairman of the Criminal Law Solicitors ' Association , said he was concerned by what his members were telling him . <p> " Accurate interpretation is absolutely essential to the operation of the criminal justice system in the police station , magistrates ' court and crown court , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closely monitoring the operation of the new contract and working with the contractor to ensure it worked as effectively as possible . <p> An ALS spokeswoman said 3,000 interpreters are registered with the company , who are then vetted for their qualifications and undergo independent assessment . <p> " The service was rolled out nationally less than two weeks ago and has been operating well , although there have , inevitably , been some teething troubles , " she said . <p> " We are closely monitoring the service , will investigate any complaints made about the system and make changes and improvements as necessary . Assigning qualified and experienced linguists to assignments and insisting on continuous professional development , while reducing operational inefficiencies , remains the focus of our service . "
