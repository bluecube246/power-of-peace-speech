" <h> Religious controversy <p> In August , a month after Libya 's first elections since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi , Mr Magariaf was voted as the leader of Libya 's 200-member General National Assembly . <p> He was labelled a " moderate Islamist " - no doubt because of his ties to the NFSL , which in the 1980s was known as a militant Islamist group . <p> But he is " far from that " , says Asma , explaining " he is deeply spiritual but also deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very personal " . <p> " His preference - and , of course , this is something that will be up to debate within the constitutional committee - is that he supports secularism .

" <p> But that preference , which Mr Magariaf spoke about in an Arab newspaper , has sparked controversy - and prompted a walkout by some assembly members , including those who felt his words meant he had already decided Libya 's future form of governance . <p> His response was an immediate public apology - and a partial retraction . <p> " It is obvious that our reality has no room for secularism or theocracy , " he said , but added , " and it has no room for men of religion with absolute powers . " <p> Mr Magariaf will serve as Libya 's interim head of state until fresh elections are held in 2013 , following the drafting of a new constitution .
