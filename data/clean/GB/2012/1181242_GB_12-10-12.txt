His friendly manner and off-the-record chats have made him popular with journalists - and many say he is " really cool ... and quite liberal " .  Outside media circles , those who know the chairman of the General National Congress describe him as a man of unwavering principles .  But for many Libyans , their interim leader is a mystery ; he went into exile in 1980 and only returned after the fall of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi 's regime in 2011 .  Published author  Mr Magariaf is a prolific reader and writer - and over the years he has published several books on Libyan politics , history and economics .  He also enjoys watching films .

" My mum would drive him around - and it was funny to see them together with him commenting on how fast or slow she 's driving , " she recounts .  Old family friends remember an industrious young Magariaf , dedicated to his family .  While at secondary school in Benghazi - where he was born in 1940 - he worked part-time at an accounting firm to help support 11 siblings .  He finished school in 1958 , reportedly scoring the highest marks in the whole of what was then the Kingdom of Libya .  He went to the UK on a government scholarship before returning to Libya to work as an economics professor at the university in Benghazi .  Between 1972 and 1977 , he was in charge of the government accounting and meant he had oversight of the coffers under Col Gaddafi .  Failed assassinations  In 1978 , he was posted to India as the ambassador - because , his family says , he had become becoming increasingly outspoken about the government corruption he had witnessed .  Two years into the job , Mr Magariaf defected to first Morocco then Egypt before settling in Georgia , US .  He co-founded and served for two decades as the secretary-general for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya ( NFSL ) , the opposition group made famous by its failed assassination attempt on Col Gaddafi in 1984 .  Mr Magariaf himself has survived several assassination attempts .  Image caption Mr Magariaf has " unwavering principles " say his friends  Mr Magariaf resigned as head of the NFSL when he was named leader of the General National Congress .  Over the years , Mr Magariaf 's family have paid a heavy price for his anti-Gaddafi stance ; one of his sisters was imprisoned for three years and his brothers for eight .  His political activities lives of his seven children .  Asma says she has asked him several times whether he regretted joining the opposition .  " He is always emphatic about it being the most difficult decision he made in his life , to risk his life and that of his family , " she says .  He is deeply committed to the idea that one 's relationship with God is very personalAsma , daughter  " But after that he made peace with it and then he felt there was no fear , no hesitation and no going back . "  Religious controversy  In August , a month after Libya 's first elections since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi , Mr Magariaf was voted as the leader of Libya 's 200-member General National Assembly .  He was labelled a " moderate Islamist " - no doubt because of his ties to the NFSL , which in the 1980s was known as a militant Islamist group .  But he is " far from that " , says Asma , explaining " he is deeply spiritual but also deeply is very personal " .  " His preference - and , of course , this is something that will be up to debate within the constitutional committee - is that he supports secularism . "  " He always feels that if you do n't have that separation , there is room for abuse and we ca n't take that chance again . "  But that preference , which Mr Magariaf spoke about in an Arab newspaper , has sparked controversy - and prompted a walkout by some assembly members , including those who felt his words meant he had already decided Libya 's future form of governance .  His response was an immediate public apology - and a partial retraction .  " It is obvious that our reality has no room for secularism or theocracy , " he said , but added , " and it has no room for men of religion with absolute powers . "  Mr Magariaf will serve as Libya 's interim head of state until fresh elections are held in 2013 , following the drafting of a new constitution .
