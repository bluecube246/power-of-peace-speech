<h> Inside the new issue of Uncut ... <p> Is history speeding up , or am I just getting older ? I doubt I 'm the first man of a certain age to have a minor existential crisis triggered by an album reissues programme . It 's been caused these past few weeks , though , by reviewing a couple of albums for the new issue of Uncut ( officially out today in the UK ) that I wrote about first time round -- and not , it seems , that long ago . <p> One is the debut by the Vancouver collective , Black Mountain , whose " Druganaut " was a key part of the first CD of new psychedelia I compiled for Uncut , " Comets , Ghosts And Sunburned Hands " . " Black Mountain " , amazingly , came out in 2005 , hence the tenth anniversary deluxe reissue . <p> The second is our Archive Album Of The Month , Michael Head 's " Magical World Of The Strands " . , a kind of opiate folk record that relocates the spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head 's story is a spectacularly messy one , and various true believers have been trying to make him famous -- with his first band , The Pale Fountains , then repeatedly with Shack -- for three decades now , without much in the way of success . " The fate of Michael Head , elusive genius with few contemporary equals , remains uncertain , " I wrote in NME 18 years ago , when The Magical World first came out . " As this album once again so conclusively proves , he deserves the world . " <p> With the likes of Mick Head -- and , indeed , Uncut 's cover stars this month , The Rolling Stones -- it 's tempting , as storytellers , to repeat the myths and circumnavigate the actual music , not least because music is often substantially harder to write about . I tried this time , though , to contextualise Head as part of a deep and transporting musical tradition , rather than as a chemically-adjusted outrider of Britpop . And in a similar spirit Mick Jagger , not always the keenest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing interview about the making of one of his greatest albums , " Sticky Fingers " . <p> Elsewhere in the issue we have the terrific Jim O'Rourke interview that I wrote about last week ; an exclusive inside story on the 13th Floor Elevators reunion ; a piece about the radical visions of Hipgnosis , featuring insights from Robert Plant and Nick Mason ; plus new interviews with Sturgill Simpson , James Taylor , The Blockheads , Jah Wobble and one Ringo Starr . In reviews , you 'll find Sun Kil Moon , Richard Thompson , Jamie xx , Leon Bridges , Kacey Musgraves , Rickie Lee Jones , Robin Gibb and Little Richard . Oh , and there 's an interview with a lost ' 70s LA act called Smokey ( the singer almost replaced Iggy in The Stooges ) that I ca n't recommend strongly enough . <p> Smokey 's singles were mostly so obscure , for various amusing reasons , that they 've rarely been heard since they were made . " Sticky Fingers " , though , has been played a few times in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable exception ... <p> " I have never listened to it , probably since it was recorded , since the playback sessions ... I never listen to them again , " says Mick Jagger . Forty-four years : what happened there ? Back in the blink of an eye ...
