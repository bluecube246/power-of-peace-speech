Don't listen to those who try to own the definition of a video game

So new year is coming , the time when for centuries video games journalists have traditionally knelt before their console or PC of choice and begged the Pixellated Games Fairy for just one wish . Do n't tell me you 've never heard of the Pixellated Games Fairy .  Next you 'll be saying you do n't believe in Santa Binding-Clause , by whose grace we are not prosecuted for breaking the terms in " standard agreements " we agreed to without reading .  Anyway . This coming year , dear PGF , may I never hear anyone critique a game again with the following terrible words : " It 's not a game . " Or : " It 's not even a game . " Or : " Yeah , fine , it 's sold a million copies but is it really a game ? "  This criticism is usually hurled at games that are interesting , experimental , unusual , gentle , thoughtful , quiet or quirky ; I 've heard it levelled at the exploration game Proteus as well as as well as the meta-weirdness of The Stanley Parable . It comes up in a few different contexts :  Gamer dudebros whose objection seems to be : " But there is n't any shooting , I have no way to win or lose , it 's not hard enough , I ca n't prop up my masculinity by showing a bunch of strangers on the internet how great I am at this thing ! " To which I can say only : sure , puberty is a really hard time for everyone . You 'll get through .  People who do n't think of themselves as gamers , who want to say that the thing they like , because it 's just growing flowers or popping bubbles or carding the wool of a flock of tiny sheep , ca n't really be a game . " Oh , I do n't really play games , I 'm just super into this flock of tiny sheep right now , look , I just got my first Brecknock Hill Cheviot ! " Well , if you 're playing that game , not wanting to be associated with a hobby you enjoy . Just own it .  The most pernicious of all : digital-thinkfluencers , gamification marketeers , playfulness-consultants and other peddlers of old rope who want to be the gatekeepers of what is and is n't a game . They often suggest that games must have rules . Or points . Or levels . Or win-states . They want games to seem simple and easily packaged -- for it to seem that there is a clear definition and they are the ones who know it -- because they want to sell their expertise to companies in the form of " gamification " .  This is that thing where your supermarket tries to encourage you to get to the next " level " in orange juice consumption and websites now have a " percentage complete " indicator to try to get you to give them more of your personal data . This is an understanding of " games " as a grand-scale Skinner reward box , not a medium that has important things to say ; it is narrow and should completely ignore " this is not a game " arguments is this : if you want to make and play interesting things , why limit yourself ? As a game designer , I suppose I could start from a broadly accepted view of " what a game is " . I could make sure you can win or lose each level , I could put in twitch-reflex tests and keep a points score . But starting there has already cut out so many possibilities . Deciding in advance what you expect to see in " a game " ( or a novel , or a museum ) means that you ca n't ever make something that truly surprises .  So I 'm going to suggest a radical answer to the question : " Is this a game ? " It 's this : if the creators or players of the thing call it a game , it 's a game . I can almost hear the baying hordes rising up as I write this . " Oh , but then you can call anything a game ! I could call and chocolate sandwich a game ! Dogs and cats living together ... mass hysteria , gamety game game game ! " To which I 'd answer : fine . And wipe the froth from your mouth . Because the important question is n't : is this a game ? The important question is : is it good ? And there 's no one-size-fits-all template for that . There 's just playing , experimenting , reflecting , saying : " Did this experience move me , did it excite me , did it show me something new , did it make me want to make things like it myself ? " And those are questions much more worthwhile than : " Is it really a game ? "  Games are still such a young medium ; barely 40 years old . Why limit ourselves now ? We 're just scratching the surface of what games are and what they can be .
