<p> I have experienced life on the breadline . I was a single parent and although I always worked , I needed income support . That experience made it possible for me to go into areas that are very impoverished or deprived for my work , and to know that people in these places can have very rich and interesting lives . I 've always found a huge amount of humour and resourcefulness . <p> In a city like London we walk the same pavements as other people , but our experiences are so different . The same piece of pavement could be where a homeless person sleeps , where a young person goes to party or a frontline for a young guy in a postcode war . For my latest work an audio art installation at the Roundhouse I wanted to find a way in which , instead of walking past people , you could hear their stories . The people that you might be afraid of , repulsed by , intrigued by -- they would speak to you . <p> I recorded a lot of interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews is with a sex worker . Everybody talks about sex workers as victims . These women rarely get to speak for themselves . It 's the same with marginalised young men who are involved in stabbings and so on . Hearing these people articulate their own experience is a valuable thing . <p> Where I live I do n't know any of my neighbours . But if I go into what we call a " hood " , I ca n't walk down the street without stopping to say hello to lots of people . The rich are impoverished by not understanding what the less well-off have and what they can offer us . Those migrants who are drowning in the sea , they 're probably full of ideas and enthusiasm , things we could learn and benefit from . <p> We are living in an incredible moment in which there 's an appetite for thinking differently about a system that clearly does n't work . People such as Russell Brand and Charlotte Church are making radical politics interesting to young people , and I 've never experienced that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in a deeply conservative British expat community in Argentina . As a girl growing up in the 1950s -- it 's almost unbelievable now -- you were brought up to get married and maybe have a short stint working as a secretary or a teacher beforehand . But I was just desperate ; I could n't breathe . When I was about 16 I joined a radical theatre group and my world turned upside down . <p> My comfort zone is always outside my comfort zone . I do n't feel comfortable really knowing what I 'm doing , so I like to leap into the unknown . <p> The widening inequality in rich countries like ours , where some people do n't have enough to eat and others have vast surpluses , will lead to disaster and uprisings . We 're all connected , and if we live in a society in which the poorest people are stabbing each other and the richest people are committing suicides in mansions , we 're all diminished by that . But there 's always a possibility for change . Hopelessness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should march towards the sound of gunfire . On the other side of that it 's always very interesting , whereas if you run away you do n't learn anything . <p> A friend of mine once told me : " If you do what they want you to do , at best it will be all right and at worst it will be all right . If you do what you want to do , at best it will be fantastic , at worst it will be a disaster . " Who wants to be just all right ? <p> Music sort of invades you . It avoids your rational brain so that you can be overwhelmed and transported into another place and another time . I love Shostakovich and Sibelius . And I love grime , which is authentically British and gives a voice to people who do n't have one . <p> As a parent I tried to encourage and nurture what my child wanted to be rather than what I wanted him to be .
