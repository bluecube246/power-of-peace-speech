<p> Ava DuVernay says awards are " unimportant in the grand scheme of things . " <p> The ' Selma ' filmmaker admits receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Director for her acclaimed civil rights movie would have been the " cherry on top , " but insists she was n't too upset about the snub because she just wants to continue making films about " people on the margins . <p> " Speaking at the film 's European premiere , she told BANG Showbiz : " There 's a lot of work to do in terms of diversity and inclusion in all industries , but certainly Hollywood is a part of that . As a black person - as a woman film-maker - all I can do is focus on my work . I ca n't sit around worrying about what someone is not doing for me . I need to do it for myself . <p> WireImage <p> Nicole Scherzinger attends the European Premiere of " Selma " at The Curzon Mayfair <p> " I make these films , I show them to audiences - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it happens ; if it does n't , it does n't . What 's most vital , beyond awards , which is just so really unimportant in the grand scheme of things , is that women , more people of colour , more people on the margins are able to have their voices heard in film .

But certainly , the time is now for this one . We 're so pleased that it was our turn , our time and that we were able to get this off the ground - that we were able to see our film in lights in the UK is a particular thrill . "
