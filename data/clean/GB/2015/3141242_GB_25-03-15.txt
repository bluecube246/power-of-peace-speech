'Cecil Rhodes' colonial legacy must fall - not his statue'
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/25/south-africa-rhodesmustfall-statue

it 's obvious that cecil john rhodes is not someone to admire by today 's standards and the events of last week -- when south african students threw a bucket of excrement over his statue at the university of cape town ( uct ) -- only serve to highlight this .  the protest prompted furious discussion across the country as to history 's place in the present , with the dean of uct finally announcing yesterday that the removal of the statue had been approved by senior leadership .  " uct is an argumentative university . this is an abiding strength and undoubtedly , the students are leading a national debate , " he said .  rhodes was born in 1853 and went on to become one of the world 's wealthiest men and the premier of cape colony in 1890 . but he is also responsible for the beginnings of enforced racial segregation policies in south africa , with his early drafting of the natives land act which later came into effect in 1913 .  upon his death in 1902 rhodes donated of the best universities in the country . aware of this history , protesters called for the statue 's removal from the centre of the campus with a well-organised #rhodesmustfall campaign , arguing that the institution should become " more african " . some even called for his remains to be exhumed and sent back to the uk .  south africa does indeed have a responsibility to redress previous atrocities and injustices , but does this have to be done in a way that edits and distorts history ?  critical issues facing sa right now : poverty , crime , corruption , education . wdnt it be nice if ppl were worked up by those ? #rhodesmustfall  protesters have said the statue stands for white supremacy , racism , imperialism , and the oppression of the black african majority . discontent spread to rhodes university in grahamstown , too .  a student representative , siyanda makhubo , told the south african press that the name of the grahamstown university needed to be changed : " rhodes is a symbol of our past . but it looks like , " makhubo said .  these views of rhodes ' history are legitimate , as much of his wealth was acquired by despicable methods that often involved forcefully evicting african people from their land .  dr max price , vice chancellor of uct , summed up the contradictions by saying that although rhodes was considered a " great man " and " great politician " the attitudes and means he used " were not right " .  as a black alumnus who walked past that statue for four years , i think rhodes should be left exactly where he is  " he was racist . he used power and money to oppress others . so on balance he was a villain , " price told citypress .  the statue of rhodes at the university of cape town . photograph : schalk van zuydam/ap  for many students , the statue is not just a simple reminder of rhodes ' former power . it 's as much a symbol of his dubious past as his financial donation , and highlights south africa 's problematic history -- something black uct alumnus who walked past that statue for four years , i think rhodes should be left exactly where he is . removing him omits an essential part of the institution 's history that has contributed to everything good , bad and ugly about it -- and arguably the country too .  there 's really no need for statues to remember colonialism , apartheid &amp; its key figures.their work is evident in our lives . #rhodesstatue  uct is no different to the majority of south african institutions that were established before the first democratic election in 1994 . all of them have inherited problems from previous regimes and all of them inadequately reflect the demographic profile of the country .  in light of yesterday 's announcement , we must ask : where do we draw the line when editing the history and figures who have played an influential role in south africa 's narrative ? who decides -- and how -- on what stays and what goes ?  a good example is that of shaka zulu , a significant figure in south africa 's past who neighbouring xhosa , sotho and swati people of their land .  removing these symbols of the past does not change the future  as a xhosa person flying through an airport named in his honour -- the king shaka international airport near durban -- this presents a similar dilemma . but this does n't mean i think his place in history be edited out .  these include little or no focus on african philosophies and perspectives , a student body that does n't adequately reflect the country 's demographic profile and a predominance of white male academics .  the same amount of energy that has been used to campaign for #rhodesmustfall should be put into championing faster transformation . we should be fighting for a more just and sound education system , better access to student funding and the building of more universities promised by the government .  these campaigns can lead to real change -- not the removal of a statue .  siya mnyanda is a politics and philosophy major from the university of cape town and currently works in the private sector
