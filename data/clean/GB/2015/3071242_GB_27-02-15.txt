A State Of Trance Festival Was Impressive But Needed To Up The ...

<p> Since the nineties , pioneers of Trance have entered the spotlight but faded into other genres as the industry has changed . Armin Van Buuren however , has provided a consistently strong presence that has seen the Trance community catapult into one of the most connected out there , thanks to the phenomenal event known as ' A State of Trance ' . <p> Since it was first conceived in 2001 , A State of Trance has evolved into a weekly radio show that attracts over 20 million listeners , spread across more than 74 countries . Every year , the show is celebrated in style as ' A State of Trance ' visits countries all around the world , to bring the live show to hundreds of thousands , with state of the art production and a stellar line-up which makes it the number one Trance event to attend . <p> A State of Trance 700 was an important milestone and the first year an entirely new concept was introduced , the ' ASOT Festival ' . The idea was simple , split the event into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a warm-up show in Sydney , the show in Utrecht was the first of many , and home to Armin Van Buuren , curating something we only anticipated as being ultra special . <p> The arena itself was completely indoors and the pure scale of the building was incredible , making the atmosphere completely perfect for an event of this scale . Split into four stages , including two main stages , a ' Who 's Afraid of 138 ? ' stage for those fans wishing to party a little harder and a ' New Talent ' stage to showcase the up and coming Trance DJs of the future , there really was a wide selection available . <p> As we arrived to find our bearings , skimming from stage to stage , it became quite clear where we wanted to spend most of our time . The two main stages offered a significantly ramped up production on the other two , with Mainstage One offering the most in terms of visuals . As big fans of the Anjunabeats label , Mainstage Two offered the most appealing line-up initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a mash-up of Audien 's ' Wayfarer ' and Above &amp; Beyond 's ' Sun &amp; Moon ' provoking the strongest of reactions from the crowd , which we must say , we were n't too impressed with throughout the entire event . There was a lot of people there just stood still , with very little dancing happening . As we moved to Mainstage One again to see Cosmic Gate , we could clearly see why . <p> " Mainstage One is full " <p> While there was the potential to expand this stage to a wider area , this message became commonplace throughout the night . We attempted to wait for thirty minutes to get in , but security were keeping a strict admission policy to those with Deluxe tickets only . As a result , we were unable to enter Mainstage One on several occasions , which is why Mainstage Two became the main focus for our review . <p> The production here was nowhere near to the scale of Mainstage One , however the line-up made up for it . As Gareth Emery took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the best Trance sets of all time executed , to the wildest crowd reaction we saw all night . As his set drew to a close , Armin Van Buuren stepped up to the decks where the crowd continued to party hard . Everyone had finally come out of their cage , and the night had begun in style , albeit a few hours too late ! <p> The night soon drew to a close at 07:00 , following a great set from Aly &amp; Fila , who played a tonne of exclusives which left positive memories of the event in our minds . This was also the first time we could get access to Mainstage One . <p> As for the line-up , it was great but prior to the event , the ASOT team surveyed people on Facebook to see who they would like their the most . Gareth Emery , Above &amp; Beyond and Dash Berlin featured the most , but only Gareth Emery made an appearance . This was potentially due to conflicts with Ultra Festival happening at the same time in Buenos Aires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . <p> All in all , A State of Trance 700 ' ASOT Festival ' , was nothing short of impressive . Compared to previous events however , we feel as though there should have just been the one main stage , with capacity significantly increased .
