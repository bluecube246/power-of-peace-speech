How to get free of the mortgage trap  For many people who feel they have outgrown their home , the mortgage or rent is keeping them captive Getty Images  The latest property market data would suggest it is still a great time to be a homeowner . According to the Nationwide building society , average prices rose by 0.1 per cent in November , while the average monthly UK rent was up by 3.5 per cent to ? 749 a month ,  That comes at time when the average property in the UK costs nearly ? 300,000 , according to the property portal Rightmove .  For many would-be buyers looking to get a mortgage , and homeowners looking to remortgage , the reality is less than rosy . The Financial Ombudsman this week highlighted the plight of " mortgage prisoners " -- older people stuck with interest-only loan that they are unable to pay off .  It has also received complaints in the past year from mortgage customers considered to be most at risk of failing to keep up their mortgage repayments their lender 's highest rate .  But it is not just older or riskier borrowers who have been trapped ; even those trying to save for their future are finding themselves unable to remortgage or even move home .  David Baker of the adviser LIFT-Financial said a mix of stricter mortgage criteria , lack of affordable housing and low interest rates had made it harder to get a good deal .  " The Mortgage Market Review , which came in last April , has meant outgoings like school fees and credit cards are scrutinised more than ever , " he explained . " Some lenders even look at pension contributions ; some clients make huge contributions but from a mortgage point of view that 's considered an expense and is deducted when a mortgage affordability calculation is made . "  An increasing number of people are also finding it hard to remortgage after a relationship breakdown . Quite often the stricter affordability criteria mean they can not buy their partner out .  Lisa Agasse , 49 , is a freelance personal assistant and founder of a  " I got caught out by the endowment scandal , I took out a 25-year mortgage in 1990 and I had to extend it in 2013 because the endowment paid out less than I put in . "  Lisa owes around ? 66,000 and her flat is worth ? 300,000 .  " It sounds like I have options but I am self-employed -- and although I have a lot of equity in my flat , it does need modernising . I 've been told that my chances of getting a mortgage if I want to move are limited because lenders are much stricter now . Also , if I were to move locally a small two-bed house would cost about ? 400,000 to ? 500,000 , which I ca n't afford right now . "  The rental prisoner  Sarah and her husband Peter both earn more than the national average salary , but an increase in their monthly rent is due to take effect next month , leaving them unable to keep saving for a deposit .  " Childcare bills are ? 1,000 a month left to save . We need to move because the state of the rental property is questionable , with damp and a garden falling apart .  " Last month the rent went up from just under ? 800 a month to ? 1,100 . This means we can now only save ? 100 a month .  " We would love to move to a cheaper place so we could keep on saving , but in five years the average rent has risen from ? 500 to ? 1,000 , so we would be paying more for a smaller place . We are stuck -- forced to pay more rent to a landlord who ca n't even be bothered to maintain the property . "  The relationship prisoner  Sarah , a solicitor , is desperate to move up the ladder . She lives in a one-bed flat in Kent with her four-year-old daughter . She split with her partner but he still owns half the property .  " A lot of my friends moved out from London to buy bigger homes and to take advantage of good to buy my partner out . It 's heartbreaking as I have limited contact with him for personal reasons .  " When we tried to buy a larger flat a few years ago when I was pregnant , we were beaten to two-bedroom houses by buy-to-let investors . Now , where we live , all the homes are being bought up to rent out . "  How to get free of the trap  If you ca n't remortgage , it 's worth paying off your home loan until you hit a milestone " equity " level . For example , if a borrower can get their " loan to value " down to 70 per cent , they could qualify for a lower-cost ? mortgage . Banks borrow tranches of money at set levels -- 70 per cent , 75 per cent and so on -- so they can pass on the discount to borrowers .  Many people are taking a mortgage until they are 70 to 75 because they are still working . Those wanting to downsize should consider lowering the selling price of their home your lender in the loop . " If you are splitting up with a partner , your lender can help explain what your options are . "
