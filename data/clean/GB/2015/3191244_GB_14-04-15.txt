james kirkup says the conservative manifesto pledge of 30 hours a week of free childcare shows the party has finally come to terms with modern british life  the conservative promise of 30 hours a week of free childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds is big news , bigger than the right to buy , bigger than tax cuts . working parents are now the no 1 target for the conservative re-election effort .  yes , there will be questions about how the tories will fund it : will their tax raid on the pension contributions of high-earners really cover the cost ? and doubtless some will wonder if there are sufficient providers .  but that 's secondary . the main point is that the conservatives have decided to reach out to working parents and say , " we get it . we understand the hassle and difficulty of combining children and work . "  cameron launches tory manifesto  the unspoken message : " we know you think tories are rich men who are n't be bothered about this stuff because we have nannies home , but actually , we do understand . "  the usual election promise caveat applies , of course : no pledge made 20-odd days before voting is likely to fundamentally transform any party 's image . but just as it was smart for labour to finally address its economic credibility problem , it 's smart for the tories to reach out to working parents in an attempt to address their " people like us " problem .  the conservative childcare pledge is important for another reason too . for a long time , the tories have tied themselves up in knots about the question of work and children . even though the party 's leadership believes that it would be a good thing , economically and socially , if more women with children were to work , tories have been wary of making that case .  the reason for the caution is the party 's attachment to the notion that mothers should stay at home with their children instead of working . tension with the stay-at-home mother ( sahm , if you 're a mumsnetter ) lobby coalition government implemented , as " family values " tories complain that single-earner families are not benefitting from things aimed at making lives easier for families where both parents work .  general election 2015 - what are the possible outcomes ?  listening to the sahm lobby is rarely good politics for the tories . it makes the party look old-fashioned and out-of-touch with modern life . whatever the cause , whatever the rights and wrongs of it , more women are working : the employment rate for women is now 68.5 per cent , up from 56.9 per cent in 1980 . there 's also some evidence that being a single-earner household is increasingly the preserve of the very poor or the very rich : the majority of parents in the middle , by choice or necessity , both work .  accepting these things does n't , incidentally , imply any judgement on those who do stay at home to raise their children . it simply means accepting facts for what they are .  working and raising your children , at the same time - that is conservatives have finally decided to get over their fear of the stay-at-home mother brigade and admit it .
