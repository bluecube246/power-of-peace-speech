<h> A MASSIVE volcano has been ' found ' on Mars - and it is similar to the enormous one on Earth in the Yellowstone National Park . <p> The crater left by what was believed to have been a supervolcano on Mars <p> A huge 24x18mi crater , which is more than a mile deep , has been spotted on images of the Martian surface by European Space Agency ( ESA ) experts . <p> Several craters have been found in the northern highlands of the Red Planet before . <p> They are thought to have been left by eruptions three billion years ago but nothing has been spotted before on this scale . <p> On Earth a super volcano , such as Yellowstone , would produce more than 600 cubic mi of magma and block so much sunlight it could have a huge impact on the global climate . <p> The new " volcano " named Siloe Patera has two large craters , meaning there could have been two separate massive eruptions . <p> GETTY <p> The Mars crater would have been left by a volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the Arabia Terra area of Mars are calderas , the collapsed centres of volcanoes , but not just any volcanoes - these are thought to be martian super volcanoes <p> An ESA spokesman <p> The pictures were taken by the high-resolution stereo camera on the ESA Mars Express probe . <p> An ESA spokesman said : " Scientists believe that Siloe Patera and a number of similar features in the Arabia Terra area of Mars are calderas , the collapsed centres of volcanoes , but not just any volcanoes - these are thought to be martian super volcanoes . <p> " A number of irregularly shaped craters have been detected in the Arabia Terra region that could represent a family of ancient supervolcano calderas . <p> " Siloe Patera is one such example . It is characterised by two depressions with steep-sided walls , collapse features and low topographic relief . " <p> The Arabia Terra area has plains of fine-grained , layered sulphate- and clay-bearing materials , which could well be lave from old eruptions , some experts say .
