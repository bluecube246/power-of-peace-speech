<p> In the months before John Lennon was tragically gunned down outside The Dakota in New York City on December 8 , 1980 , by deranged killer Mark David Chapman , life for the ex Beatle and his bride Yoko Ono was full of ' unclouded happiness ' . <p> And those moments , during the creation of what would be their last album together , are captured in the collection of photographs of the couple , published for the first time in the book , Double Fantasy . <p> The photographs were taken by Kishin Shinoyama , who has now written about them in a book by him and Yoko Ono , published by Taschen Books in multiple international editions . <p> The touching and beautiful collection of never-before-seen photographs were shot while they were making their last album together : the Double Fantasy Album . <p> Scroll down for video <p> Woman : John confided to the photographer who shot these pictures that he had been obsessed with alcohol , women and drugs until Yoko came into into his life <p> Double Fantasy , which won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love story in song <p> Cozy : John and Yoko schmooze in the outdoor patio of a Manhattan restaurant . <p> ' John could n't go out anywhere while he was in the UK because of his fame , ' writes Yoko .

As the two of us thought about it , suddenly the face of Kishin Shinoyama came to mind . <p> ' I said , " For once , I 'd really like to have a Japanese photographer . " John quickly agreed , saying , " Right , that sounds good . " I never expected that " for once " would turn out to be the last album John and I made together , and that " for once " would live on forever ' . <p> Kishin Shinoyama remembers that last recording session : ' I checked in at the Hotel Lexington , and by early afternoon I was down the street at the door of The Hit Factory on West 48th Street , the recording studio where John and Yoko were working on the final parts of the record , inserting choruses and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs -- 14 of John 's and 14 of Yoko 's .

' He was trying to clear away those feelings -- of fame , of the past -- in order to become a new person . <p> ' He explained to me that without Yoko , he would n't be there now - that the first part of his life he had been obsessed with alcohol and women and drugs , and that Yoko had been the first woman to tell him that what he was obsessed with was meaningless . <p> ' He felt that those words had changed him , and this new album was going to celebrate that change ' . <p> A month after Kishin returned to Japan , John was shot and killed . <p> ' I look back at these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I captured John and Yoko at their happiest moment .
