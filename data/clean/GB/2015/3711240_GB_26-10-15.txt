Get daily news by email  Sabre-toothed tigers and giant hyenas helped protect the prehistoric environment by controlling the numbers of plant eaters , a new study claims .  Savage predators , twice the size of the present day equivalents , helped maintain the ecosystem by keeping the plant eating beasts , such as enormous ground sloths and hippos , in check .  The curved and serrated dagger-like canines of a sabre-toothed cat , or Smilodon , were seven inches long and one bite to the neck could instantly sever crucial arteries of a mammoth or mastodon .  BBC  Savage : Sabre-tooth cats had huge teeth that could kill with one bite  When these largest modern-day herbivores are confined to too small an area they devastate the vegetation .  So scientists were intrigued as to how the environment survived 15,000 years ago when the mammoths , mastodons and giant ground sloths were even larger , more numerous and more widely distributed .  They say the enormous predators called ' hypercarnivores ' - about twice as large as the wolves , able to take down a five year-old juvenile mastodon weighing over a ton .  Hunting in packs cave hyenas could possibly bring down a nine year-old weighing two tons .  This ancient breed of hyena was twice the size of the famous laughing hyenas of the African savannah growing up to 285lb ( 130kg ) and hunted in 30 strong packs .  Getty  Ancient : A smilodon in the snow with a mammoth in the background during the Pliocene-Pleistocene era  Its massive molars could crush bone and helped it hang onto and incapacitate mastodons and Colombian mammoths .  Mastodons are members of an extinct group of animals known as Mammuthus which were similar to elephants but covered in thick hair and had long curved tusks .  While woolly mammoths were more closely related to elephants and lived across northern Europe , Siberia and part of North America , mastodons were only found in North America , where they lived on a diet of leaves and branches .  They had long and straighter tusks compared to mammoths and were shorter but more heavily muscled Academy of Scientists were based on a series of mathematical models for the sizes of predators and prey in the late Pleistocene - about one million to 11,000 years ago .  Getty  Feral : Unlike many creatures in this list , hyenas survive to the present day  Professor Louise Roth , an evolutionary biologist at Duke University , North Carolina , said : " From the present day it seems that big animals like elephants are immune to predation .  " In fact Pleistocene ecosystems were a lot more complex and predators could have had a larger impact . "  She said : " So much of our science is based on the last 50 or 100 years . " But populations of big cats and wolves would have been much larger before humans arrived on the scene .  The study estimated size ranges for Pleistocene predators based on the fossil record - including teeth - because researchers can make a reasonable estimate of an animal 's size based on just the first molar .  Prof Roth developed formulas for the relationship of shoulder elephants to estimate how large some of the plant eaters found in fossil evidence would have been .  Getty  Giant : Woolly mammoths were related to elephants  But modern adult elephants with the same shoulder height may vary by as much as two times in body mass , Roth said .  Add to that the " age structure , " the mix of animals of different sizes in a given herd , and her calculations of mammoth sizes cover " a whopping range . "  Researchers developed a range for what some of these shaggy grass-eaters would weigh and calculated if these big predators might be able to capture an herbivore .  Because there is no way to infer from the scant fossil evidence whether predators hunted in packs , the researchers relied on estimated prey sizes and modelled the capacity of single predators and predators in groups to take them down .  They conclude juvenile mastodons and mammoths would indeed have been susceptible - especially if the carnivores were socially organised .
