In spells we looked good enough to win the league , but no team that weak on crosses wins the league .  It was clear from the pre-season games it was a weakness and it has n't been addressed . Tim Howard gets a bit pinned to his line on corners and no one really dominates the area for us .  Overall it was an exciting game that was great to watch and in Lukaku we have a forward of the highest calibre that could be as unplayable as Suarez was for Liverpool if he keeps up his progression .  I am a big fan of Mirallas . He has a real will to win and a lot of ability . I think his time may come towards the end of the season , the balance up front at the minute is working well an excellent option to change tack in a game as is Naismith .  Mirallas ' time will come  I would keep him and try to get him on for Kone a bit more as Kone flags in the second half .  Should Leighton Baines go straight back into the starting XI now ?  Yes , Galloway has proved he will make it as a Premier League defender , but it is clear to me that he is a centre back . I think it is easy to forget the attacking impetus Baines offers .  Baines deserves to come straight back in  He put one ball into Lukaku on Monday from the left back position that nearly created a goal . Baines has also been loyal to the club and deserves his place when fully fit . Galloway 's time will come .  With Wolfsburg knocking United out of the CL - do the Blues deserve more credit for doing the double over the Germans last season ?  I was at the game at Goodison and it could have been 4-4 . We had you think we could have a special team if we hang on to the players .  When teams try to play expansively against us we have a formidable counter attack . Teams really got on to it after performances like Wolfsburg last term , but this season they seem to be letting us do it again .  Everton 's counter attack is lethal  I think we are a bigger club than just getting credit for beating a good team , so it does not bother me too much that it seems to have been forgotten .  What 's your take on Everton 's set piece woes ?  Attacking corners are a real mystery to me . Mori looks good in the air , Stones ' header against Man Utd was brilliant . Kone and Lukaku are both good in the air . The balls going in are from Barkley or Deulofeu usually , sometimes Barry , and they all have good delivery .  Ross Barkley and John Stones ( Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images )  I just do n't think we put much value a bit nastier in the box .  Defensive corners I would put down to Howard some of the time as he is not commanding but I think the manager just does not place much stock in set piece work .  Anything else to add ?  I think the club is playing the best football I have seen in my time going the match . Martinez will get it right in the long run .  We could nick fourth spot if we keep playing positively , some of the fans get so down on the players so quickly now , they need to take a breath and realise what it was like under Walter Smith or worse Mike Walker !
