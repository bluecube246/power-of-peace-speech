<h> Get Everton FC news by email <h> What did you make of the draw with Palace ? <p> I thought at times we played like Man United under Ferguson . We attacked in waves and used the flanks well . In spells we looked good enough to win the league , but no team that weak on crosses wins the league . <p> It was clear from the pre-season games it was a weakness and it has n't been addressed . Tim Howard gets a bit pinned to his line on corners and no one really dominates the area for us . <p> Overall it was an exciting game that was great to watch and in Lukaku we have a forward of the highest calibre that could be as unplayable as Suarez was for Liverpool if he keeps up his progression . <p> I am a big fan of Mirallas . He has a real will to win and a lot of ability . I think his time may come towards the end of the season , the balance up front at the minute is working well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent option to change tack in a game as is Naismith . <p> Mirallas ' time will come <p> I would keep him and try to get him on for Kone a bit more as Kone flags in the second half . <h> Should Leighton Baines go straight back into the starting XI now ? <p> Yes , Galloway has proved he will make it as a Premier League defender , but it is clear to me that he is a centre back . I think it is easy to forget the attacking impetus Baines offers . <p> Baines deserves to come straight back in <p> He put one ball into Lukaku on Monday from the left back position that nearly created a goal . Baines has also been loyal to the club and deserves his place when fully fit . Galloway 's time will come . <h> With Wolfsburg knocking United out of the CL - do the Blues deserve more credit for doing the double over the Germans last season ? <p> I was at the game at Goodison and it could have been 4-4 . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think we could have a special team if we hang on to the players . <p> When teams try to play expansively against us we have a formidable counter attack . Teams really got on to it after performances like Wolfsburg last term , but this season they seem to be letting us do it again . <p> Everton 's counter attack is lethal <p> I think we are a bigger club than just getting credit for beating a good team , so it does not bother me too much that it seems to have been forgotten . <h> What 's your take on Everton 's set piece woes ? <p> Attacking corners are a real mystery to me . Mori looks good in the air , Stones ' header against Man Utd was brilliant . Kone and Lukaku are both good in the air . The balls going in are from Barkley or Deulofeu usually , sometimes Barry , and they all have good delivery . <p> Ross Barkley and John Stones ( Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images ) <p> I just do n't think we put much value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit nastier in the box . <p> Defensive corners I would put down to Howard some of the time as he is not commanding but I think the manager just does not place much stock in set piece work . <h> Anything else to add ? <p> I think the club is playing the best football I have seen in my time going the match . Martinez will get it right in the long run . <p> We could nick fourth spot if we keep playing positively , some of the fans get so down on the players so quickly now , they need to take a breath and realise what it was like under Walter Smith or worse Mike Walker !
