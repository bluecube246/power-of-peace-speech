Climate change is threatening the seabirds of St Kilda

<p> The survival of seabirds including puffins and kittiwakes on St Kilda -- the island archipelago home to one of the world 's most important seabird populations -- is being threatened by climate change , striking new evidence shows . <p> Naturalists have discovered that the kittiwake , a small migratory gull with ink-black wing tips , is on the brink of disappearing from St Kilda . The remote cluster of Scottish islands in the eastern Atlantic is the UK 's only place with two Unesco world heritage site listings -- for its culture and natural history -- and one of only 24 sites with a dual listing worldwide . <p> The kittiwake did not breed in St Kilda this season , with just one chick born there this year after a 99% decrease in occupied nests since the 1990s . Its adult population has since halved . The number of fulmar chicks has plunged by 33% since 2005 , while St Kilda 's puffin population is in persistent decline . <p> " This data from St Kilda is really extremely worrying , " said Dr Paul Walton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Society for the Protection of Birds . " We are losing whole colonies of these birds now and it 's a very serious issue . Frankly , it breaks my heart , it really does . " <p> With crucial UN climate talks approaching their halfway point in Paris , the data underscored the case for urgent action on climate change , he said . Capping the growth in global temperatures at 2C -- the target for policymakers -- could be enough to allow the marine environment to adapt over time , Walton added . <p> " There 's a very strong climate change link here that needs to go straight to Paris : what they decide there is going to determine the future of our seabirds , " he said . " We are clear on what the science is saying , that really big ecology effects of climate change are unfolding in the marine environment around Scotland right now . It 's not coming , it 's here now . " <p> St Kilda -- now regarded as one of the world 's most significant bird sanctuaries -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs and poetry heavily featured the seabirds they subsisted on before moving off the archipelago in 1930 . <p> A fulmar chick inside a prehistoric building in Glen bay .

When bird populations are at their highest , about 1 million birds perch on the island 's high , precipitous cliffs , sea stacs and rocky crags , hosting the world 's largest gannet colony and nearly a third of the charismatic Atlantic puffins that live around the UK and Ireland . <p> In 1987 , the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) counted 7,829 kittiwakes on the islands . Now that number stands at 3,886 . When routine monitoring began 21 years ago , there were 513 occupied kittiwake nests there , with 56 chicks born . This year , researchers found just four nests , a 99.2% decrease , and a single chick . <p> The number of fulmar nests has declined by 37% since 2002 , with productivity rates well below normal levels , averaging 0.28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puffin numbers are also struggling . At 0.59 chicks per burrow , the NTS says puffin breeding is " still below the long-term average and , set against the longtime scale of the decline , suggests conditions are becoming less suitable for breeding " . <p> Susan Bain , who manages the island for the NTS , has ruled out windfarms and overfishing as other causes for the birds ' decline . Studies of dead kittiwakes found they had not been eating their normal diet , suggesting fish had moved to follow the cooler waters . <p> Lighter and more buoyant than their neighbouring gannets , the birds struggled to dive to the necessary depths . As a result , dead chicks were found having digested non-nutritious pipefish . <p> " We 're seeing significant declines in the number of species , which suggests that there 's something changing in the seas , " Bain said . " We know the sea temperature is getting warmer , so the fish are moving or are at greater depths . " <p> Bain says the headline figures are worrying , given the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its Unesco status , yet . " At the moment , no , I 'm not worried , but I would n't want to be complacent about that either , " she said . " If these declines continue , then maybe . " <p> Regular , long-term visitors had noticed the kittiwake 's absence , she added . " We were seeing a couple of hundred nests around the village bay in the past . Now there are four , which is devastating . It 's very noticeable . They 're statistically extinct , although we will continue to look for them next year . <p> " It is normally a noisy place . You walk up to the cliffs and put your head over and it 's constant noise of fulmars , guillemots and razorbills . When they leave and go out to sea it 's silent , you really do notice . It would change the nature of the place significantly if that soundtrack was gone . "
