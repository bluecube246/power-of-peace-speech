Kapow ! Attack of the feminist superheroes  From She-Hulk to Ms Marvel and the new female Thor , a new generation of hero is revolutionising the world of comics and consigning sexualised stereotypes to history . And while some of the ' fan boys ' are grumbling , this is a battle they just wo n't win  The action in issue five of the new series of Thor is par for the course in a superhero comic . Absorbing Man , a granite-coloured lug with a wrecking ball , is on a crime spree and Thor , the Norse thunder god who joined the Marvel Comics universe in 1962 , is trying to stop him . The crucial difference in this series is that Thor is now a woman .  The scene is writer Jason Aaron 's pointed riposte to the uproar last summer when Marvel announced that the mantle of Thor would pass to a woman and some aggrieved male fans accused the company of pandering to political correctness . For people outside the comic-book world , the backlash seemed to confirm the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons .  In fact , a seismic upheaval is under way . The new Thor is outselling her predecessor by 30% -- and she 's in good company . Three years ago , writer Kelly Sue DeConnick promoted the former Ms Marvel , Carol Danvers , to Captain Marvel , whose adventures have attracted a loyal cadre of fans called the Carol Corps . Charles Soule reinvented She-Hulk in a witty series that explored her day job as a lawyer . Most significantly , there is G Willow Wilson 's new Ms Marvel , a 16-year-old Pakistani-American Muslim called Kamala Khan . The book has become a cultural phenomenon , covered by CNN , the New York Times and The Colbert Report , and embraced by campaigners against Islamophobia in San Francisco , who plastered over anti-Muslim bus adverts with Kamala stickers . Wilson is currently co-writing an all-female Avengers book , A-Force , with Marguerite Bennett .  Marvel 's " Big Two " rival DC , meanwhile , has refreshed old female characters such as Batwoman , Batgirl , Catwoman , Wonder Woman more progressive world of independent comics , there are socially diverse hit series such as Saga , Rat Queens , Lumberjanes and The Wicked + The Divine .  Now that superheroes have taken over the summer box office , what happens in comics has major ramifications for mainstream culture . These are the characters that kids grow up with -- on World Book Day , primary schools teem with pint-sized Spider-Men -- and adults flock to see . The macho lineup of recent movies ( no woman has headlined a comic-book film since Catwoman and Elektra flopped a decade ago ) makes the genre appear immutably male , but Warner Bros has green-lit a long-overdue showcase for DC 's original feminist crimefighter Wonder Woman , while Marvel has scheduled a Captain Marvel movie for 2018 . There are also new TV shows devoted to Captain America 's wartime colleague Peggy Carter , superpowered private detective Jessica Jones , and Supergirl .  The speed of change has surprised even the writers . Wilson , who is a Muslim convert , remembers when Marvel editors Sana Amanat and Stephen Wacker approached ' We want to create a new teenage female American Muslim superhero and put her on her own book . ' I thought , ' You 're insane . You 'll need to hire an intern just to open the hate mail . ' So when , all of a sudden , everybody was talking about it , I was stunned . I believe that if we 'd tried to do the exact same book even five years ago the response would have been very different . It 's coming at a very particular time in the history of American comics . "  When Marvel was expanding rapidly in the 1970s , female superheroes were often afterthoughts , cynically created as brand extensions : Spider-Man begat Spider-Woman , Hulk begat She-Hulk , and so on .  " There was an Adam 's rib effect , " says Sean Howe , author of the bestselling Marvel Comics : The Untold Story . " It was n't just that these characters were less well thought-out than their male counterparts ; they were actually derived from their popular holdings . " ( that the female Thor is n't called " She-Thor or Lady Thunderstrike " . )  Back then , both the readership and creative roster were overwhelmingly male . While long-time X-Men writer Chris Claremont introduced compelling new women such as Storm , Rogue and Kitty Pryde , their popularity within a team did n't translate into solo success .  Rat Queens : one of the new generation of female-led comics . Photograph : Image Comics  Ann Nocenti was Claremont 's editor before becoming one of Marvel 's few female writers . Her first assignment was to kill off Spider-Woman .  " Female characters were absolutely seen as secondary , " she says . " I ca n't tell if I was just oblivious to sexism and misogyny , but I do n't remember any weird feelings . Not at all . But you would try a female character and the sales would go down . It 's a chicken-and-egg thing .  Why did female superheroes fail ? Maybe because nobody was writing for women . I never thought I was writing for women . That was characters such as Nocenti 's Typhoid Mary , a subversive riff on old female stereotypes , and Claremont 's female X-Men were rare exceptions . Superheroines such as Black Widow and the mutant pop star Dazzler usually played second fiddle , while many artists pandered to adolescent fantasies , drawing superpowered Playmates with wasp-waists , DD busts and frankly impractical costumes . " An artist would come in with samples and sometimes I 'd look at them and think y'know , I do n't think this guy has a girlfriend or respects women , " Nocenti remembers .  Marguerite Bennett , who co-writes the Thor spin-off Angela : Asgard 's Assassin with Kieron Gillen , remembers being frustrated as a young reader . " I could n't quite articulate why certain things felt off to me , " she writes via email . " Many women were obviously one-dimensional : perfect girlfriends , nagging shrews , femmes fatales -- tragic , scorned , disposable women . But even with living heroines , something felt sour and discordant . These heroines were capable , competent , fearless , and yet they male validation . Most of western literature focuses on male power fantasies . No one much cares about what a female power fantasy would be . "  Most of western literature focuses on male power fantasies . No one much cares about what a female power fantasy would be  With depressing regularity , female characters were raped , tortured , maimed or killed in order to spur male heroes into action . In 1999 , Gail Simone , a pioneering figure for the current generation of female writers , documented this trope on the website Women in Refrigerators . Kelly Sue DeConnick invoked another household object when she told Comics Alliance in 2012 : " Never mind the Bechdel test , try this . If you can replace your female character with a sexy lamp and the story still basically works , maybe you need another draft . They have to be protagonists , not devices . " For decades , too many female characters failed the Sexy Lamp Test . So why the sudden change ?  Last year 's big comic conventions reported approximate gender parity , as fast as male ones . DC co-publisher Jim Lee recently acknowledged that readers were " looking for a lot more flavours and diversity in our line than we 're currently doing " .  " It 's tough to expect corporations to be in the vanguard , " says Howe . " But even the people looking at the bottom line have the sense that you should have something better to offer women than hourglass figures in Spandex . "  Howe suggests that some new readers have been drawn into the Marvel universe by the onslaught of blockbuster movies . Wilson notes the growing number of female retailers . But they agree that the biggest factor is the internet . Twitter , Tumblr and websites such as Comics Alliance and The Mary Sue , have enabled a more inclusive form of comic book fandom . All the female-led books sell better in digital format than in print .  " When I was a child , comics were relegated to stores that were clearly meant for adult men , " says Bennett . " All the same , I , and love of those characters provoked me into finding alternate routes to access comics .  On the internet , we could have a community of our own . Girls are growing up among these characters . Why should n't they be welcome ? "  Ann Nocenti left the comic book industry in the 90s but returned in 2012 , taking over DC 's Catwoman . Her first convention in years was an eye-opener . " I looked around and I thought : ' This is half women , half men ! ' It was completely different . I think if I could go back and start writing Catwoman again my stories would be different . I was n't aware there was such a strong female audience . "  Even though the proportion of female creators continues to hover around just 10% , this demographic shift in readership has also changed the way characters are depicted . The costumes designed for Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel by Jamie McKelvie , who draws The Wicked + The Divine , are striking and attractive -- they 're superheroes after all playful illustrations for Charles Soule 's She-Hulk were a breath of fresh air for a character who had spent decades looking like a fitness model .  " She-Hulk has sometimes been portrayed as something of a glamorous , sexy , amazon type , " Soule writes via email . " I just presented an extremely competent attorney and superhero who happened to be a beautiful , 7ft-tall green woman . Massively sexualised images of women in mainstream superhero comics are often held up for ridicule these days , which I do n't think would have happened as much even 10 years ago . "  " People can no longer say : ' Well it 's just you , you 're being oversensitive , ' " says Wilson . " There 's a critical mass of people who say : ' Yo , it 's not really OK to portray a 16-year-old girl like a porn star . ' "  The readership is growing and changing and they want to see their stories represented as well  Even so , feminist critics such as Asselin routinely receive vicious abuse its own , milder version of the Gamergate wars that have convulsed the gaming community , as an angry minority of male fans push back at what they perceive as killjoy political correctness . Breitbart 's Gamergate cheerleader Milo Yiannopoulos claims that comics have been hijacked by " ultra-progressive misandrists who basically hate their own core audiences " . Some older creators agree . The artist Erik Larsen , co-owner of independent publisher Image Comics , recently grouched on Twitter : " I 'm tired of the big two placating a vocal minority at the expense of the rest of the paying audience by making more practical women outfits . "  Wilson faced a similar reactionary backlash when Ms Marvel was announced . " I see why they feel threatened , " she says . " They think that there 's a movement afoot to do away with straight , white , male characters all together . Obviously that 's not true . The people who love comics today grew up reading all of that stuff . Nobody 's talking about tearing it all down and beginning from scratch . and changing and they want to see their stories represented as well . "  The success of Ms Marvel and Captain Marvel has little to do with identity politics and everything to do with great storytelling . When Carol Danvers had her first solo book as Ms Marvel in 1977 ( " This Female Fights Back ! " ) , she was burdened with being Marvel 's token feminist role model : a superpowered Gloria Steinem . The new Ms Marvel , however , is an ordinary adolescent wrestling with parents and school as well as the responsibility of superpowers . Fifty-three years after Stan Lee created Spider-Man , it 's hard for a straight , white man like Peter Parker to represent the gawky underdog . Like the half-black half-Latino Miles Morales , who became a second Spider-Man in 2011 , Kamala Khan is a modern take on a classic archetype .  " We did n't want a model minority book where the whole purpose is to walk around and represent what it 's like to be a south-Asian Muslim in America , " says Wilson . " been a teenager . "  Far from being didactic , these comics honour some of Marvel 's first principles . In the 1960s , superheroes such as Spider-Man outshone DC 's Superman and Batman by having rich , uncostumed lives , with money worries and romantic angst . When The Uncanny X-Men became a phenomenon in the early 80s , Chris Claremont used anti-mutant bigotry as a metaphor for racism and homophobia . These heroes all felt different . Decades later , introducing more LGBT characters and superheroes of colour makes narrative sense . Because the superhero comics industry largely relies on constantly reinventing characters that were created decades ago , it is uniquely well-placed to mirror social change .  " There 's a bit of catchup going on , " says Howe . " And yet when you look at stuff like Ms Marvel you can see that comics can also advance attitudes beyond the status quo . I 'm glad that Marvel movies did n't find their greatest success at a time when Marvel comics were filled with enhanced breasts and shrinking hips . "
