Black smoke can be seen billowing from behind the ruins but there is no mention of when the video was filmed .  At one point in the video a voice can be heard saying :  " In the name of God , and peace be upon his messenger , by the grace of God we have defeated the Alawites today , by the grace of God we have conquered Jezel , by the grace of God we have conquered Jezel , by the grace of God we have conquered Jezel . "  The capture of Palmyra has stoked fears that the militants might try to destroyone of the Middle East 's most spectacular archaeological sites - a well-preserved , 2,000-year-old Roman-era city on the town 's edge - as they have destroyed others in Syria and Iraq .  Syria 's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim said he was still afraid the jihadist group would blow up Palmyra 's 2,000-year-old Roman ruins at Palmyra including tombs and the Temple of Bel , which could be viewed as idolatrous in its puritanical vision of Islam . fine . There is no damage so far " .
