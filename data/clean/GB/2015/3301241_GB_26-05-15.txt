black smoke can be seen billowing from behind the ruins but there is no mention of when the video was filmed .  at one point in the video a voice can be heard saying :  " in the name of god , and peace be upon his messenger , by the grace of god we have defeated the alawites today , by the grace of god we have conquered jezel , by the grace of god we have conquered jezel , by the grace of god we have conquered jezel . "  the capture of palmyra has stoked fears that the militants might try to destroyone of the middle east 's most spectacular archaeological sites - a well-preserved , 2,000-year-old roman-era city on the town 's edge - as they have destroyed others in syria and iraq .  syria 's antiquities chief maamoun abdulkarim said he was still afraid the jihadist group would blow up palmyra 's 2,000-year-old roman ruins at palmyra including tombs and the temple of bel , which could be viewed as idolatrous in its puritanical vision of islam . fine . there is no damage so far " .
