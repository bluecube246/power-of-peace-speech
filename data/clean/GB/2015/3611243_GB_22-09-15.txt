<p> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has successfully produced the first samples of Nvidia Corp . ' s code-named GP100 graphics processing unit . Nvidia has already started to test the chip internally and should be on-track to release the GPU commercially in mid-2016 . <p> 3DCenter reports that Nvidia has sent the first graphics cards based on the GP100 graphics processor to its subsidiary in India , where it has a lot of hardware and software developers . No actual details about the chip or graphics cards on its base are known , but it is about time for the graphics giant to start testing its GP100 . <p> Nvidia taped out the GP100 in June , 2015 . Production cycle of TSMC 's 16nm FinFET process technology is about 90 days , therefore Nvidia got its GP100 from TSMC very recently . Right now the company is testing the chip and its drivers internally . <p> Nvidia 's GP100 graphics processing unit is based on the " Pascal " architecture and is made using 16nm FinFET+ process technology . The chip is expected to integrate up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graphics cards featuring the GP100 will carry up to 32GB of HBM2 memory . <p> KitGuru Says : It is about time for Nvidia to start testing its GP100 now . What remains to be seen is when exactly the company plans to formally introduce its next-generation GPUs . If the first revision of the chip is fully functional , the company may move in introduction of the GP100 to the first quarter of the year . <p> Nvidia gets first samples of GP100 from TSMC , begins internal tests , 4.4 out of 5 based on 9 ratings <p> Only to be sold for 900$ " JUST " because it is faster than the previous <p> VA:F 1.9.221171 <p> Rating : +1 ( from 1 vote ) <p> http : //careersreport.com Karen Gonzalez <p> Allow me to show you a@ fantastic ways to earn a lot of extra money by finishing basic tasks from your house for few short hours a day -- See more info by visiting &gt;MYDISQUSID : : <p> VA:F 1.9.221171 <p> Rating : 0 ( from 0 votes ) <p> TristanSDX <p> internal testing = multiplayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 0 ( from 0 votes ) <p> Gary ' Gazza ' Keen <p> It wo n't be that crazy expensive but what the hell do you expect . New and better things are more expensive than old and shitty things , especially considering Pascal is a huge performance boost .
