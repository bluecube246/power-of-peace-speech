taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co. has successfully produced the first samples of nvidia corp . ' s code-named gp100 graphics processing unit . nvidia has already started to test the chip internally and should be on-track to release the gpu commercially in mid-2016 .  3dcenter reports that nvidia has sent the first graphics cards based on the gp100 graphics processor to its subsidiary in india , where it has a lot of hardware and software developers . no actual details about the chip or graphics cards on its base are known , but it is about time for the graphics giant to start testing its gp100 .  nvidia taped out the gp100 in june , 2015 . production cycle of tsmc 's 16nm finfet process technology is about 90 days , therefore nvidia got its gp100 from tsmc very recently . right now the company is testing the chip and its drivers internally .  nvidia 's gp100 graphics processing unit is based on the " pascal " architecture and is made using 16nm finfet+ process technology . the chip is expected to integrate up to graphics cards featuring the gp100 will carry up to 32gb of hbm2 memory .  kitguru says : it is about time for nvidia to start testing its gp100 now . what remains to be seen is when exactly the company plans to formally introduce its next-generation gpus . if the first revision of the chip is fully functional , the company may move in introduction of the gp100 to the first quarter of the year .  nvidia gets first samples of gp100 from tsmc , begins internal tests , 4.4 out of 5 based on 9 ratings  only to be sold for 900$ " just " because it is faster than the previous  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : +1 ( from 1 vote )  http : //careersreport.com karen gonzalez  allow me to show you a@ fantastic ways to earn a lot of extra money by finishing basic tasks from your house for few short hours a day -- see more info by visiting &gt;mydisqusid : :  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  tristansdx  internal testing = multiplayer : 0 ( from 0 votes )  gary ' gazza ' keen  it wo n't be that crazy expensive but what the hell do you expect . new and better things are more expensive than old and shitty things , especially considering pascal is a huge performance boost . stick to the #60 's if you ca n't afford it  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  dallas  jesus already testing the chip .. were looking at a february release ... maybe march  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  http : //72.21.81.85 topher.mctophertone  better than a 650$ amd card that can be beaten by older 350$ amd cards not using hbm  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  evilm3nace  it will allow for up to 32 gb but will only carry maybe 4-8 max. even then because amd has first rights to hbm2 and subsequent memories sequels , they might not even get that high .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes you marked it out it 's going , within 10 years we will be paying around $2000 for a normal high end card " just because it and it 's predecessors were*faster and better* building up the price for no real reason since every successor costs about 5 times less to make "  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  lololol  i tell u they gon na just test it out with hbm2 not use it in final builds . they will probably make their own stacked vram  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  sandcat  wrong , wrong , mega wrong .  skylake is a huge performance boost over a pentium d , does that make it more expensive ? no .  moores law applies to gpus as well .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  humb  it will be great but they do nt have working memory controler , , , , ,  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes ) n't know how you calculate that every successor costs 5 times less to make .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  fewtcher  amd have no " rights " over hbm because they are not manufacturing hbm .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  boffifis1  the flagship maybe but the more mainstream will be priced competetivly ( bad english )  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  boffifis1  playing bf maxed out 4k 300fps so they have to gimp the cards  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  boffifis1  i hope its minimum 6-8gb  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  evilm3nace  no but they co created the technology , and under that , they get first rights to the chips from the manufacturers .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  sky mage  wow nvidia is trying to justify their use of hbm with some very powerful rock 4k@60 and 1440p@120 without a problem ... though witcher 3 will be a little challenging . ? ?
