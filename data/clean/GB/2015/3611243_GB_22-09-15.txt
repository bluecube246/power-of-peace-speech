Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has successfully produced the first samples of Nvidia Corp . ' s code-named GP100 graphics processing unit . Nvidia has already started to test the chip internally and should be on-track to release the GPU commercially in mid-2016 .  3DCenter reports that Nvidia has sent the first graphics cards based on the GP100 graphics processor to its subsidiary in India , where it has a lot of hardware and software developers . No actual details about the chip or graphics cards on its base are known , but it is about time for the graphics giant to start testing its GP100 .  Nvidia taped out the GP100 in June , 2015 . Production cycle of TSMC 's 16nm FinFET process technology is about 90 days , therefore Nvidia got its GP100 from TSMC very recently . Right now the company is testing the chip and its drivers internally .  Nvidia 's GP100 graphics processing unit is based on the " Pascal " architecture and is made using 16nm FinFET+ process technology . The chip is expected to integrate up to Graphics cards featuring the GP100 will carry up to 32GB of HBM2 memory .  KitGuru Says : It is about time for Nvidia to start testing its GP100 now . What remains to be seen is when exactly the company plans to formally introduce its next-generation GPUs . If the first revision of the chip is fully functional , the company may move in introduction of the GP100 to the first quarter of the year .

New and better things are more expensive than old and shitty things , especially considering Pascal is a huge performance boost .

They will probably make their own stacked Vram  VA:F 1.9.221171  Rating : 0 ( from 0 votes )  Sandcat  Wrong , wrong , mega wrong .  Skylake is a huge performance boost over a pentium D , does that make it more expensive ? No .  Moores law applies to gpus as well .
