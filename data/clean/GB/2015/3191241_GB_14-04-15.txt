One of the organisers of the cross-denominational conference , entitled Transformation Potential : Unwanted Same-Sex Attractions " , was Andrea Minichiello Williams , the director of pressure group Christian Concern , who is also a member of the General Synod .  She said : " Some people want access to therapeutic support to help themselves reduce unwanted same-sex attractions and they should have the freedom to do so .  " But therapists who seek to offer this treatment are unable to secure professional accreditation and have their licences to practice removed .  " The gay lobby groups are trying to close down discussion and close down the option of help for those who seek it . "  Professor Robert Gagnon , of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary , was a keynote speaker at the conference .  He said : " Homosexual practice assaults the very foundation of sexual ethics , which is God 's creation of male and female for sexual union . "  Prof Gagnon added that he believed homosexuality was " partly narcissistic and partly self-deceptive " .  Reporters were Centre in Westminster .
