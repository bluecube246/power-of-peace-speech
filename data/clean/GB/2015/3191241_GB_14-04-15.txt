one of the organisers of the cross-denominational conference , entitled transformation potential : unwanted same-sex attractions " , was andrea minichiello williams , the director of pressure group christian concern , who is also a member of the general synod .  she said : " some people want access to therapeutic support to help themselves reduce unwanted same-sex attractions and they should have the freedom to do so .  " but therapists who seek to offer this treatment are unable to secure professional accreditation and have their licences to practice removed .  " the gay lobby groups are trying to close down discussion and close down the option of help for those who seek it . "  professor robert gagnon , of pittsburgh theological seminary , was a keynote speaker at the conference .  he said : " homosexual practice assaults the very foundation of sexual ethics , which is god 's creation of male and female for sexual union . "  prof gagnon added that he believed homosexuality was " partly narcissistic and partly self-deceptive " .  reporters were centre in westminster .
