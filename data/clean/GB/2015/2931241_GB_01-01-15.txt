Ed Sheeran: from boy next door to biggest-selling artist of the year
http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/ed-sheeran-boy-next-door-biggest-selling-artist

<p> Nice guys finish last , so the saying goes . There is one man , though , whose recent chart success seems to challenge that maxim . Official figures show that Ed Sheeran , who has persisted with his scruffy image and simple songwriting , was the biggest-selling artist of 2014 with his second album , X. He is Britain 's biggest export since Downton Abbey . <p> Sheeran , already the most searched-for male celebrity on Google , may well see his career scale further heights in 2015 , with two Grammy nominations and three nights at Wembley Stadium in July -- two of which are sold out . Performing with only a backing band , loop pedal and an acoustic guitar , he is about to pull off the biggest busk of all time . <p> So how did Sheeran , a relatively normal bloke , making relatively normal music , manage to become Britain 's biggest-selling artist ? <p> Niceness alone , of course , does n't account for his blockbuster success with album X ; it sold 1.7m copies in 2014 in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , and has had over 430m streams worldwide since its release in June -- more than any other artist globally . Perhaps it is more thanks to Sheeran 's skills in balancing his guise as the bastion of shabby student authenticity with the role of mercurial businessman -- not to mention a fierce sense of underdog ambition . <p> Ed Sheeran poses with singers Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande and Victoria 's Secret models at a London fashion show in December . Photograph : Karwai Tang/WireImage <p> A bit of luck helps , too . The initial spark for Sheeran 's stratospheric success can be traced back to two chance events . The first occurred during an impromptu LA trip in 2010 , which led to a friendship with the actor and musician Jamie Foxx . Foxx saw Sheeran play and ended up providing him with exposure in the US on his radio show , The Foxxhole . That same year , Sheeran 's music was noticed by the web mogul Jamal Edwards , whose online channel SB.TV has shone a light on the wealth of talent emerging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborating with established grime artists including Wiley , JME and Sway , while he simultaneously worked the grind of indie venues in London , performing 300 shows in 2010 alone . <p> With opportunities opening in both the US and UK , Sheeran was able to establish fans on both sides of the Atlantic -- an accomplishment many musicians are unable to crack throughout the duration of their career . <p> George Ergatoudis , head of music for Radio 1 and 1Xtra , believes Sheeran 's ability to straddle a multitude of modern genres makes him stand out . " He switches between folk music and black music in a unique way ... no one else channels Eminem and Damien Rice simultaneously like he can , " he says . <p> Such careful cultural curation appeals to a range of ages , genres and genders , and allows Sheeran to be playlisted on Radio 1 , Radio 2 and BBC 1Xtra . The latter channel named him the most powerful artist on its annual Power List -- a choice that triggered controversy , given 1Xtra 's description as the " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indie crowd and pop audiences -- the singer has toured with Taylor Swift -- Sheeran 's honeyed vocals and dalliance with rap styles has also helped increase his trajectory in the US , where hip hop and R&amp;B is a far more lucrative business than in Britain . This year he collaborated with rapper The Game and appeared on the cover of the influential rap magazine Vibe . <p> Ed Sheeran - You Need Me , I Do n't Need You <p> Although much rap music can be about bragging , intrinsic to Sheeran 's aesthetic is his ability to appear everyday . Material on his debut album , + , had an obsession with promoting his allegiance to reality ( " Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors/Nationwide tour with Just Jack/Still had to get the bus back " ) , and his Twitter feed is a constant source of disarming truths , such as " doing the Victoria secrets fashion show tonight and I 'm eating a Greggs sausage roll in the dressing room " . <p> Doing the Victoria secrets fashion show tonight and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eric Clarke , professor of music at Oxford University , thinks this is a potent attribute for an artist in 2014 . " His boy-next-door image -- not very good looks but a perfectly nice guy -- and the song Thinking Out Loud , with its reflections on getting older and fidelity and love in a fairly conventional context , is a slight counter-blast to fast-living celebrity culture . " <p> This sense of self-imposed legitimacy also taps into the kind of heartfelt testimonies found on X Factor . <p> According to the book Faking It : The Quest for Authenticity in Popular Music , there are three kinds of authenticity in music 's history : cultural authenticity ( appearing true to your culture ) , personal authenticity ( appearing true to yourself ) , and representational authenticity ( not " faking it " in terms of how you record your music ) . <p> Hugh Barker , the book 's co-author , says that cultural authenticity has become slightly less important over time as music is increasingly globalised . He says : " Personal authenticity seems to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very few songs that directly referenced the writer 's life . That changed with songs by people like John Lennon , James Taylor , Carole King -- and since that time autobiography has become ubiquitous , and is often used as a badge of authenticity . " <p> Ed Sheeran -- Thinking Out Loud <p> A far more straightforward explanation for Sheeran 's global impact lies within his songs . Fiona Bevan , the singer-songwriter who co-wrote One Direction 's Little Things with Sheeran , pins the copyable nature of his songs on the youth market 's current captivation with him . <p> She says : " Because of the fact that Ed plays solo guitar , and you can hear the acoustic guitar part on the records , the songs are accessible to people to learn to play at home . All his songs are so well written that you can strip away all the production and the songs still stand in their own right . I think the YouTube generation gravitate towards this clear , seemingly simple songwriting when they want to cover their favourite songs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible surge in awareness from fans on YouTube making their own versions and spreading them far and wide . " <p> To others , Sheeran 's ascent is baffling , perhaps even offensive to those who hoped that the voice of a new generation might be more revolutionary . In 2012 , the influential journalist Caitlin Moran tweeted : " If my kids ever tell me they like Ed Sheeran , I 'll put them in a sack and throw them in a canal . " Sheeran 's response was to sidestep a potential social media spat by sending her " lots of hugs " via Twitter , prompting regret and a grovelling offer of drinks on the part of Moran . Which just goes to show that you never should underestimate the potency of being nice . <h> Most streamed artists 2014 <p> 1 Ed Sheeran <p> 2 Sam Smith <p> 3 Arctic Monkeys <p> 4 Eminem <p> 5 Calvin Harris <p> 6 Coldplay <p> 7 One Direction <p> 8 Beyonc ? <p> 9 Katy Perry <p> 10 Bastille <p> * This article was amended on 1 January 2015 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Keith Negus , professor of musicology at Goldsmiths , University of London .
