San Bernardino: 'pledge of allegiance' to Isis is no proof of group's ...

The news that US investigators are evaluating evidence that Tashfeen Malik may have either " pledged allegiance to the Islamic State " or expressed support for the group before launching the attacks which killed 14 and wounded 21 , in San Bernardino , California , on Wednesday prompts many questions .  If Isis were to be directly responsible , or even played a significant indirect inspirational role , the killings would be a major escalation of terrorist threat and activity on US soil . But we are far from establishing such a link -- and the motives of the attackers remain extremely unclear .  At the moment , there 's no evidence Isis directed the couple to launch the attacks , officials have told media , remarking that " we believe they were more self-radicalized and inspired by the group than actually told to do the shooting " .  So far it appears that in the days leading up to the shooting , the couple took steps to delete their electronic information . Those efforts -- along with stockpiled ammunition and bombs -- have  CNN quoted one US official as saying Malik had pledged allegiance to self-appointed Isis caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a Facebook post on the day of the San Bernardino attack , under an account that used a different name .  But at the moment we do n't know if the post was simply an expression of approval or praise for the Islamic State 's leader or activities , or a full pledge of allegiance , a bayat .  The bayat is an oath taken by an individual to obey the authority of another person , not a group and the term is mostly used when the leader of a faction pledges allegiance to the leader of a bigger organisation . One example earlier this year was when Abou Bakr Shekau , the leader of Nigeria 's Boko Haram militant group declared his loyalty to Baghdadi .  Such pledges are sometimes solicited -- Isis has been making significant efforts to win over factions -- and sometimes unsolicited : for the past 18 months , Isis has been making calls for individuals in the west to strike locally and series of so-called " lone wolf " attackers in the west have claimed to be linked to Isis ; but while some of those claims have been endorsed by the organisation , others have gone ignored .  One attack that Isis claimed as its own -- even if it appears the group had no role whatsoever in its planning and execution -- was the siege in January at a kosher supermarket in Paris . Amedy Coulibaly , a convicted bank robber who coordinated his attacks with those launched on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by two other militants , claimed in a video recorded shortly before the operation that he had pledged allegiance to Baghdadi , and thus to the Islamic State , in the summer of 2014 .  He was shot dead by police in the attack but his wife , Hayat Boumedienne , surfaced weeks later in Syria , featured in the Isis magazine Dabiq .  The attacks in Paris earlier this month which left 130 dead appear to have been much more closely controlled by the organisation , though again , details are unclear . the war in Syria .  We know that Isis likes to create ambiguity , anxiety and uncertainty . This serves a greater aim of terrorising its enemies through provocation of irrational fear -- which is especially prevalent when there is a sense that the threat is ubiquitous . But the lack of clarity serves a tactical purpose too : the group can claim an attack if it feels such a gesture would be useful ; or ignore -- or even deny it -- if it chooses to .  What investigators will also be aware of is that few " lone wolves " are indeed entirely solitary . One recent study examined the interactions of 120 supposed " lone wolf " terrorists from all ideological and faith backgrounds , and found that , even though they launched their attacks alone , in a large majority of the cases others were aware of the individual 's commitment to a specific extremist ideology .  Beyond this , however , is the question of motivation . Even a pledge of allegiance to Isis does not rule out a mix of other reasons illness -- or any of the myriad of factors which drive the perpetrators of mass shootings in the US.
