bill shorten : christensen and bernardi remind us of the harm words can do  malcolm turnbull has the power to end the damaging rhetoric about marriage equality and safe schools -- if he 's prepared to show leadership and courage  ' safe schoolslets young people who identify as gay know that they have every right to be accepted and respected for who they are . we should never underestimate how important this message is -- or the consequences of trying to shout it down . ' pictured : cory bernardi photograph : mike bowers for the guardian  some might prefer to ignore their statements , or dismiss them as deliberately provocative , but these are elected members of the government of australia , choosing to use their position in parliament to pursue a prejudicial vendetta against the safe schools program .  safe schoolshas been labelled a lot of things : marxism , cultural relativism , " grooming " and part of something called the " rainbow ideology " .  but safe schools is not about imposing an ideology , or an " treat everyone equally , to understand rather than judge . it is an important program , designed to prevent the bullying and intimidation of children who are struggling with questions of identity and sexuality .  safe schoolslets young people who identify as gay know that they have every right to be accepted and respected for who they are . we should never underestimate how important this message is -- or the consequences of trying to shout it down .  anyone who 's been a teenager , or raised one , knows growing up is hard . kids can be cruel to their peers , and many young people go through tough times and experience low moments .  but a young australian who identifies as gay is six times more likely to consider taking their own life , compared to their sibling , classmate or teammate . two out of five young australians who are gay have thought about self-harm or suicide .  for kids in the regions and the bush , physical remoteness can add to a sense of isolation .  both casual , unthinking discrimination health . both are far too common , not just in our schoolyards or online but in sporting clubs , in the outer and even in our national parliament .  if one government program , designed to teach respect and inclusion , is capable of provoking the sort of unhinged and unfounded abuse we saw from an angry few last week , i shudder to think what kind of animosity malcolm turnbull 's plebiscite on marriage equality will stir up .  there 's no doubt in my mind turnbull 's plan for a $160m taxpayer-funded opinion poll is a waste of money . but the real cost could be much higher , if harder to measure .  how do we quantify the damage done to a young person 's sense of self , if they are subjected to taxpayer-funded advertising arguing that they are a second-class citizen ?  how can we guess the effect on children of seeing australian-government sponsored advertisements claiming their parents are not fit to marry ?  how do we measure the harm inflicted by a long and poisonous debate , where all and magnified ?  it is hard to know the toll this will take on the psyches and self-confidence of so many -- but it is easy for our parliament to do something about it . as elected representatives , we have a responsibility . not just to be mindful of our words but to do the right thing with our actions .  this is why our parliament should have a free vote on marriage equality , now . the legislation is already in the chamber and i believe the numbers are there to pass it . this week , my shadow parliamentary secretary , terri butler , will be re-introducing her bill for marriage equality into the parliament .  but if malcolm turnbull wants to introduce his own bill , i would be happy to second it .  imagine if at mardi gras next saturday , instead of dreading a drawn-out and divisive plebiscite , australians were celebrating marriage equality at last .  imagine if by the start of term two , safe schools was recognised and secure .  this is far from impossible . leadership and a bit of courage , it can be done quickly and easily .
