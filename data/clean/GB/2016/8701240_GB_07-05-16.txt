If the UK were to leave the EU , a knock-on effect is almost inevitable and several markets in the UK would be hindered . However , though the European market is abating , the remittance industry is evolving . <p> Recently , farmers have insisted that if the UK were to leave the EU , food would not be cheaper , and the leader for Britain 's farmers has expressed a desire for more migrant workers . <p> Which suggests it 's a myth that migrant workers ' steal ' jobs from UK citizens . They bring a great deal of value to the UK , and European immigrants have paid more in taxes than they have received in benefits . In turn , this has helped to relieve the budgetary burden on UK-born workers and , financially , they have contributed a vast amount to the public services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20billion from 2001-2011 . <p> Migrant workers are also prepared to receive lower wages in jobs that Brits do n't necessarily want . In fact , immigrants who have arrived since 2000 are 43% less likely to claim state benefits or tax credits than natives . Hence immigrants are prepared to work , and are notoriously hard working . This positive contribution to the UK economy can often be overlooked at the expense of negative press and nationalist ideologies . <p> The fractured ecosystem , globally , and in Europe is concerning . Furthermore , no two countries are the same , thus there is a difference in lifestyles . Migrants working in the EU come from differing financial sectors where services differ from what they are familiar with . <p> As the migrant worker industry continues to populate , the remittance transfer volume also increases . Consumers and businesses send money around the world on a daily basis , however , fees can sit at an extortionate level . Numerous firms are exerting a stranglehold over the industry as they continue to charge huge fees on money sent to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a trillion-dollar lifeline for countries in a tough economic climate . <p> Fortunately for migrant workers , there are services such as TransferGo whom provide a means to send money home in a cost effective way . Both timely and straightforward , these services generally charge around ? 1 compared to banks , which charge an average transfer rate of ? 10 . <p> Incredibly , a reduction on these remittance fees could save less economically developed countries and incredible ? 10billion per year , all while keeping the same standard of security that you 'd find using a bank . <p> Remittances generate triple the total global aid budget and the value of transfers often overshadow the huge sectors of a country 's economy . Romania , Slovakia , Czech Republic , Poland , and Lithuania generate a lot of the remittance outflow whilst World Bank statistics from 2012 indicate that India received the most in remittance fees from the UK , totaling ? 4.27billion . <p> That 's a lot of money , and people are suffering from losing a lot of that through the high fees involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be paid by migrants , so is there not an argument the fees could be lowered ?
