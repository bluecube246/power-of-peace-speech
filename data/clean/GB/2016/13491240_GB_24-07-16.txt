Then there was that very naughty scene in Martin Scorsese 's The Wolf of Wall Street . <p> A scene-stealing moment in The Big Short <p> There 's a certain magic about her , which Tarzan 's legendary late producer Jerry Weintraub tried to sum up , saying : " When I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Audrey Hepburn .
