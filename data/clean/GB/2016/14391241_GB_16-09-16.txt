REUTERS/Phil Noble  FRANKFURT AstraZeneca said combining its Forxiga type-2 diabetes drug with older medicine Bydureon was more effective at controlling blood sugar levels than treatment with either drug on its own .  In a late stage trial , Forxiga and Bydureon were tested on patients whose blood sugar levels could no longer be sufficiently kept in check under an initial standard diabetes therapy with metformin .  The combination therapy led to a 1.95 percent reduction in HbA1c , a measure of long-term blood glucose levels , better than the 1.58 percent and 1.37 percent reduction from using Bydureon and Forxiga on their own , respectively .  The drug combination was also shown to be better in terms of the secondary study goals weight loss and blood pressure reduction .
