Three-quarters of maternity wards have no consultant on duty overnight  Around three in four labour wards do not have on-site overnight cover from consultants , figures suggest .  A survey of 165 maternity units found that in 2014/2015 around 27% of labour wards have consultants physically present overnight on weekdays , falling to 15% at the weekend .  The census by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) also found the number of consultants may have reduced since figures were first recorded in 2013 and some recommendations on early pregnancy care had not been implemented .  Edward Morris , vice-president of clinical quality at the body , said : " The RCOG recommends that trusts should ensure the adequate provision of consultant cover to deliver high quality safe care to women .

" Ultimately of their patient load , risk profile and staffing to decide whether their particular unit needs more frequent consultant presence . "  The RCOG said slightly fewer units had provided responses to the latest census , so the data had to be interpreted with " some caution " .  The number of consultants had reduced since the survey was first carried out , however the body said this was likely to be a reflection of a fall in responses .  However it found recommendations to increase the low number of weekend early pregnancy services had not been put into effect .  " Researchers at Oxford University have shown that overnight consultant obstetrician presence is n't proven to improve care , and a national diktat to that effect would mean the closure of many smaller units , which is another reason why it would n't necessarily be a good idea .
