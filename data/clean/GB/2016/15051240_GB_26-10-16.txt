<h> Three-quarters of maternity wards have no consultant on duty overnight <p> Around three in four labour wards do not have on-site overnight cover from consultants , figures suggest . <p> A survey of 165 maternity units found that in 2014/2015 around 27% of labour wards have consultants physically present overnight on weekdays , falling to 15% at the weekend . <p> The census by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) also found the number of consultants may have reduced since figures were first recorded in 2013 and some recommendations on early pregnancy care had not been implemented . <p> Edward Morris , vice-president of clinical quality at the body , said : " The RCOG recommends that trusts should ensure the adequate provision of consultant cover to deliver high quality safe care to women . <p> The number of consultants had reduced since the survey was first carried outCredit : Alamy <p> " It is important to highlight that all consultant-led maternity units currently have 24-hour access to consultant obstetricians on call , some with resident working where needed . <p> " Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their patient load , risk profile and staffing to decide whether their particular unit needs more frequent consultant presence . " <p> The RCOG said slightly fewer units had provided responses to the latest census , so the data had to be interpreted with " some caution " . <p> The number of consultants had reduced since the survey was first carried out , however the body said this was likely to be a reflection of a fall in responses . <p> However it found recommendations to increase the low number of weekend early pregnancy services had not been put into effect . <p> " Researchers at Oxford University have shown that overnight consultant obstetrician presence is n't proven to improve care , and a national diktat to that effect would mean the closure of many smaller units , which is another reason why it would n't necessarily be a good idea .
