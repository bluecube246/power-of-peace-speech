Rachel Brenton from Drayton tracked down Labrador Honey who fled after crash at East Ilsley  A WOMAN who helped reunite a dog involved in an A34 car crash with its family , said she was " gobsmacked " to find her in a field .  Rachel Brenton , from Drayton , near Abingdon , was moved to search on Thursday for the canine -- a Labrador called Honey -- after seeing on Facebook that it was missing .  It had been in one of the cars involved in the eight-vehicle crash at East Ilsley on Wednesday , which killed Tracy Houghton ( pictured below ) , her sons Ethan , 13 , and Josh , 11 , and her partner 's 11-year-old daughter Amiee Goldsmith .  The private banking manager called the police for help in catching Honey because she feared the dog may run on to the nearby A34 .  Officers eventually got hold of her and took her to a local vet , before she was due to be reunited with her family .  Miss Brenton , who is added : " I know how much comfort dogs can be in people 's lives and I thought at least if I could find Honey that would be something . I was gobsmacked when I did . "  Twelve others were injured in the crash on Wednesday .  Police arrested and bailed a 30-year-old man from Andover on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving .
