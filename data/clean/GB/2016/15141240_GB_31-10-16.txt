The Hoops extended their lead at the summit of the table with a 1-0 win away to Aberdeen , while Mark Warburton 's Gers produced one of their best performances of the season in defeating Kilmarnock 3-0 at Ibrox .  We discuss both matches while also considering Scotland 's left-back dilemma as injuries to Kieran Tierney and Andy Robertson present a chance for Light Blues captain Lee Wallace to earn a starting spot .  There were also big results at the bottom of the table as Ross County fell to another heavy defeat at Motherwell , while Dundee earned only their second win of the season against Hamilton Accies .
