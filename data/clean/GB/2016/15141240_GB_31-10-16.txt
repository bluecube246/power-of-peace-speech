the hoops extended their lead at the summit of the table with a 1-0 win away to aberdeen , while mark warburton 's gers produced one of their best performances of the season in defeating kilmarnock 3-0 at ibrox .  we discuss both matches while also considering scotland 's left-back dilemma as injuries to kieran tierney and andy robertson present a chance for light blues captain lee wallace to earn a starting spot .  there were also big results at the bottom of the table as ross county fell to another heavy defeat at motherwell , while dundee earned only their second win of the season against hamilton accies .  promoted stories  comments  commenting &amp; moderation  we moderate all comments on evening times on either a pre-moderated or post-moderated basis . if you 're a relatively new user then your comments will be reviewed before publication and if we know you well and trust you then your comments will be subject to moderation only if other users or the moderators believe you 've broken the rules  our colleagues  ipsoregulated press standards organisation 's editors ' code of practice . if you have a complaint about the editorial content which relates to inaccuracy or intrusion , then please contact the editor here . if you are dissatisfied with the response provided you can contact ipso here
