IT took Richard Linklater 12 years to make the Oscar-nominated movie Boyhood .  So you can hardly blame him for playing fast and loose with his next film . Over the course of three days in the autumn of 1980 , a hard-drinking , bong-smoking , skirt-chasing university baseball team awaits the first day of term .  This lot are far too busy having the time of their lives to stop and think about what it all means . This funny , brilliantly acted and wonderfully written romp lives up to its billing as " the spiritual sequel " to Linklater 's 1970s-set high school movie Dazed and Confused .  It is another star-free , period drama that perfectly recreates the spirit of a year and the age of its characters .  The soundtrack and the production design are spot-on . The year 1980 , like student life , is all about transition . The clothes and the cars are still stuck in the 70s but electronica , hip-hop and glam metal are beginning to make their first inroads into radio playlists . of disco , but these fun-loving sportsmen are determined not to miss a beat .  But the biggest difference is the make-up of the gang . Here , the girls barely get a look-in as Linklater takes us into the baseball team 's frat house .  Entertainment One  ROLL MODELS : Jake and Willoughby kicking back  " The sun may be setting on the last days of disco , but these fun-loving sportsmen are determined not to miss a beat . "  Jocks rarely get a fair crack of the whip in the movies but here the boys are allowed to be boys without any snarky commentary .  Dazed and Confused was made by a young director with an ear tuned to the rhythms of the high school canteen . Here a generous 55-year-old turns a writer 's ear to a gang of young men .  The dialogue is witty and bracingly authentic . Here friendships are forged at the bar and cemented through a democratic form of ritual humiliation .  The next lesson comes from the coach . Apparently , there are no booze and no girlsin the bedrooms . It does n't take long before both of them are smashed out of the park .  As the gang prowls the town -- taking in discos , punk clubs and country and western bars -- we get to know the players . Finn gets most of the speeches but stoner Willoughby ( Wyatt Russell ) , lovestruck hick Billy Autry ( Will Brittain ) and blowhard Niles ( Juston Street ) get their moments in the spotlight .  When Jake meets drama student Beverly ( Zoey Deutch ) , we get the early stirrings of romance . But for the most part , we just hang out with this likeable bunch as they booze and chat about sport and girls .  Every player has arrived at the university as the star of their high school team . Put them in a room together and everything -- sex , drinking , banter , dope-smoking -- quickly descends into some form of contest .  We 're nearly an hour-and-a- half in when we get to see them compete on the field fascinating but again the focus is more on the characters than the game .  It turns out only two of them have any ambition to make it as professional sportsmen . The rest are using their scholarship to fund a last hurrah before they face the sober world of work , mortgages and kids .  That fleeting sense of freedom is summed up in the film 's perfect final shot . " Everybody wants some , " goes the Van Halen lyric . And these lads can fill their boots .
