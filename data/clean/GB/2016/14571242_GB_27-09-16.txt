the billionaire hoping to become britain 's biggest fracker has said banning shale gas would cement the decline of uk manufacturing , as he brushed off environmental concerns about the hotly disputed energy source .  asked about the impact fracking could have , ratcliffe said : " i 'm from the north and there are parts of the north that are not happy places . " he added that some towns that once thrived on industries such as coal or steel were now " a bit grim " .  labour government would ban fracking in uk  read more  " the future for manufacturing in the uk will look quite gloomy if we do n't exploit shale , " he said . " i ca n't see otherwise what is going to arrest the decline in british manufacturing . "  as well as importing ethane from the us for use in the chemicals industry , ineos has licences to frack in the uk covering 1m acres , double the size of the yorkshire dales national park .  ratcliffe said the shale gas prices and created jobs but stoked fierce environmental protests -- could be replicated in britain .  " there 's no reason shale ca n't do the same things to the uk manufacturing industry as it has done in america . it dragged them out of recession in 2008 on the back of the shale revolution . the uk is clearly sat on a lot of potential shale in the same way the us is . "  the js ineos insight ship carrying the first shipment of shale gas from the united states as it passes the forth bridge to dock at grangemouth . photograph : andy buchanan/afp/getty images  he also brushed off environmental fears about fracking , a controversial technique that critics say needlessly prolongs fossil fuel use , risks polluting the water table and has been linked to earthquakes .  one of ineos 's gas suppliers , range resources , was slapped with a $4m fine in the us for environmental breaches earlier this week .  ratcliffe said : " occasionally things happen despite our best efforts . we do have spills , we do and we spend time trying to minimise that .  " life is a balance . you like your hot shower , you like your iphone and you like to drive your motor car . that 's the balance . "  in an earlier interview with bbc radio scotland , ratcliffe likened environmental accidents to getting a puncture in a tyre . friends of the earth responded angrily , saying the comparison was " cavalier " .  " you can fix a puncture in a matter of minutes , " said friends of the earth scotland 's head of campaigns mary church . " it may never be possible to fix groundwater contamination from leaking fracking wells . "  ratcliffe 's comments on shale came as ineos 's grangemouth plant prepared to take delivery of 27,500 cubic metres of ethane delivered by tanker from the us , the culmination of an investment that ineos says has reached $2bn .  labour 's pledge to ban fracking in the uk is ' madness ' , says gmb  read more  the firm fought a bitter battle with trade to close unless it was converted into a shale gas import terminal .  ratcliffe said grangemouth , near edinburgh , had been " on its knees " before ineos decided to spend ? 450m on converting the plant to accept shale gas imports .  ethane shipped from the us will replace waning north sea supplies , allowing the plant to run profitably , a plan the company says will secure 10,000 jobs for at least 20 years . the company said the arrival of imports would render the plant profitable " overnight " , a few years after it was losing around ? 100m a year .  but the gas to be processed at grangemouth is also part of a lengthy and extremely carbon-intensive journey .  ethane is separated from gas fracked from the marcellus shale formation in western pennsylvania before being sent via a pipeline to the marcellus hook export terminal on the us east coast .  the tanker is the first of eight shipping ethane from us shale fields . photograph : jeff j mitchell/getty images  there it is cooled to -90c , across the atlantic in " dragon class " tankers , burning high-emission shipping fuel , over about 10 days .  the company expects to take around one shipment a week once the transatlantic supply chain is up and running . it will convert the ethane into ethylene , which it can sell for use in a wide range of plastic products , such as plastic bags and food packaging .  the process has been made possible by america 's shale boom , which has yielded so much gas that the world 's largest economy has lifted its 40-year embargo on oil and gas exports .  the first delivery was moored off orkney for several days while awaiting ineos 's carefully stage-managed inauguration ceremony at grangemouth .  despite the choreographed nature of the event , ineos was not able to unload the gas into its ethane tank , europe 's largest , due to high winds .
