Vettel out on first lap of Malaysian GP  Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel crashed out of the Malaysian Grand Prix on the very first bend at Sepang Sunday after breaking his front suspension in a collision with Nico Rosberg and Max Verstappen .  The Ferrari driver , who was the winner last year , started from the third row of the grid but was touched by the Red Bull of Verstappen catapulting his front wheel into Rosberg , causing the Mercedes driver to spin .  Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton got away safely from pole position into the lead and avoided the drama behind him as Rosberg , who leads Hamilton in the title race by eight points , rejoined the race way down in 17th position .
