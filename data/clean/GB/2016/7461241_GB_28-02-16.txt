<h> Former Bank of England governor Mervyn King says the Eurozone is doomed to fail <p> Mervyn King , the former governor of the Bank of England , has warned that the Eurozone is doomed to fail . <p> Bailouts and other measures employed to keep the euro area intact " will lead to not only an economic but a political crisis " , according to King 's new book , The End of Alchemy , which is being serialised in the Daily Telegraph . <p> " Put bluntly , monetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand , and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other , " says King . <p> " This is extraordinarily dangerous . " <p> King says that it would have been possible to divide the Eurozone into two separate areas in 2012 , " when concern about sovereign debt in several periphery countries was at its height " . He says some members could have been temporarily relegated to a " second division " , with the aim of being promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , he adds : " It may be too late for that now . The underlying differences among countries and the political costs of accepting defeat have become too great . " <p> King highlights Germany as facing a " terrible choice " , and warns that German voters may come to resent the " losses imposed on them by the need to support their weaker brethren " . <p> " Undoubtedly the easiest way to divide the euro area would be for Germany itself to exit , " he says . <p> " But the more likely cause of a break- up of the euro area is that voters in the south will tire of the grinding and relentless burden of mass unemployment and the emigration of talented young people . " <p> King was governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013 , overseeing the central bank throughout the global financial crisis .
