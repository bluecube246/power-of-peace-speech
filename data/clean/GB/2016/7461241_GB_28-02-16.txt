former bank of england governor mervyn king says the eurozone is doomed to fail  mervyn king , the former governor of the bank of england , has warned that the eurozone is doomed to fail .  bailouts and other measures employed to keep the euro area intact " will lead to not only an economic but a political crisis " , according to king 's new book , the end of alchemy , which is being serialised in the daily telegraph .  " put bluntly , monetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand , and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other , " says king .  " this is extraordinarily dangerous . "  king says that it would have been possible to divide the eurozone into two separate areas in 2012 , " when concern about sovereign debt in several periphery countries was at its height " . he says some members could have been temporarily relegated to a " second division " , with the aim of being promoted .  however , he adds : " it may be too late for that now . the underlying differences among countries and the political costs of accepting defeat have become too great . "  king highlights germany as facing a " terrible choice " , and warns that german voters may come to resent the " losses imposed on them by the need to support their weaker brethren " .  " undoubtedly the easiest way to divide the euro area would be for germany itself to exit , " he says .  " but the more likely cause of a break- up of the euro area is that voters in the south will tire of the grinding and relentless burden of mass unemployment and the emigration of talented young people . "  king was governor of the bank of england from 2003 to 2013 , overseeing the central bank throughout the global financial crisis .
