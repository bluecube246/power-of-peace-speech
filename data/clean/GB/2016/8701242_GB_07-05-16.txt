Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life

<h> Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life <h> Share This <p> When I got an email from the Evening Standard 's education correspondent at 06.29am yesterday I had no idea that my life was about to turn to shit . She had just read an interview I 'd done for a magazine called Schools Week in which , among other things , I said that I was standing down as chief executive of the group of free schools I 've helped set up . She wanted to talk to me about why I 'd made this decision . <p> At that point , I made a terrible mistake . I asked if I could send her an email explaining why I was stepping down rather than talk to her in person . The reason for this is that I 'm in the midst of a terrible bout of summer flu . So I dashed off a quick email <p> It became clear just how stupid that was when I noticed that I 'd started trending on Twitter at around noon . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journalist who 'd contacted me , headlined : ' Toby Young : Running free school was harder than I thought . ' The opening paragraph read : " Toby Young today admitted running a free school is more difficult than he thought as he prepares to step down as CEO of the West London Free School Trust . " <p> I gawped at this with horror . At no point had I said , either in my email or in the Schools Week interview , that " running a free school " was " harder than I thought " . Critics of free schools often claim that amateurs like me are n't qualified to " run " schools and my response has always been that the people who set up free schools are n't the people who run them , unless they happen to be experienced teachers . Free schools , like nearly every other type of school , are run by headteachers . But the Standard headline made it sound as if I was agreeing with the policy 's critics . <p> In the Schools Week interview , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about teachers in the past and I also said that one of the lessons I 'd learnt is that high expectations and a traditional , knowledge-based curriculum are n't , by themselves , enough to make a good school . Just as important is making sure you have the right leaders in place who share your vision . <p> However , I did n't in any way link these observations to my decision to stand down as chief executive . I was merely reflecting on some of the lessons I 'd learnt along the way . The Standard piece gave the impression that I now regretted having bitten off more than I could chew and , having fallen flat on my face , I now wanted to hand over to a professional . <p> It got worse . The Mirror published it 's own version of the story , headlined : ' Toby Young admits " running a school was harder than I thought " in extraordinary Free Schools climbdown . ' This was followed by the Independent -- ' Toby Young admits " running a school was harder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO ' -- and the Times : ' Poster boy of free schools quits ' . <p> I began to tear my hair out -- or would have done if I had any . The Standard 's misleading headline had now become a direct quote and all the follow-up stories made it sound as if I was confessing to gross incompetence . <p> In fact , the schools in our multi-academy trust are all a huge success , something I 'm immensely proud of . Yes , making the schools work has been a challenge , but all the people involved in the trust , including the original group of " amateur " parent-founders , have overcome those challenges . <p> The secondary school , which opened in 2011 , was ranked ' Good ' by Ofsted in 2013 , and the West London Free School Primary , which opened in 2013 , was ranked ' Outstanding ' last year . We now have excellent senior leaders across all the schools , as well as fantastic classroom teachers , and I 'm sure our first batch of results , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And by " above average " I mean among the best in the country . <p> The reason I 'm stepping down as CEO -- I 'm not quitting , for heaven 's sake -- is because our trust is expanding , not contracting . Our hope is to become a multi-academy trust containing 10-20 schools over the next 10 years and that requires a more seasoned chief executive than me who can commit to the job full-time . ( I do it three days a week . ) And I 'll stay on as a director and remain involved in the schools for years to come , not least because my daughter is at one of them and my other three children will soon follow . <p> The news stories were terrible , but the comments on Twitter were something else . At one point , so many left-wing critics of free schools were crowing with satisfaction that I became one of the five most tweeted about subject in the UK . Not bad on the day that results started pouring in from elections all over the country . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to the day he falls into a pit of hungry bears wearing honey-and-fish cologne , " said a children 's author , while someone describing himself as an " artist/musician " said " I would enjoy punching his face to a pulp with no remorse " . <p> Others took what they saw as my admission of failure as proof that entrusting rank amateurs with running schools ruined children 's lives : " Too late for the thousands of children 's education he has screwed up , unforgivable . " <p> Some conspiracy theorists , believing the headline quote to be accurate , accused me of choosing yesterday as a good day to bury bad news , along with Nicky Morgan , who announced her U-turn on academies in the midst of the local election results . If that was my plan , it had clearly backfired . <p> But the tweets that were hardest to take were those praising me for my honesty . " Still though , nice of him to admit openly that the Tories education policy is a total car-crash , " tweeted a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to his profile . Another said : " Much as I hate Toby Young , at least he had the decency to admit he was wrong . " <p> On and on it went , like some unfolding nightmare . I then got a call from Channel 4 News asking if I 'd like to come on to talk about why I 'd had a change of heart about free schools . ( More gnashing of teeth . ) In spite of my hacking cough , I thought it might give me an opportunity to correct some of the misunderstandings that had sprung up throughout the day so I made my way to the studio . <p> I was on with a special needs teacher who is an ardent critic of free schools and academies and we were due to talk about Morgan 's U-turn as well as my news . I thought it started out reasonably well , in which I explained that I was n't stepping down because I 'd decided the free schools policy was unworkable , but because the ones I 'd helped set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make much of an impression on John Snow , the programme 's veteran presenter , because he then asked me if I thought the reason Morgan had rowed back on turning all schools into academies was because of the failure of my schools . <p> I was stunned . So nothing to do with the rebellion against universal academisation gathering force on the Tory backbenches , but just down to me and my supposed abandonment of the free schools policy ? This was n't exactly what I 'd had in mind by putting the record straight . <p> All in all , a truly terrible day . I do n't think the Evening Standard journalist intended to put a malevolent spin on the story -- and I 'm sure she did n't write the headline -- but the combination of the two created a frame for the news of my departure as CEO that was a gift to critics of the government 's education reforms . <p> For the past seven years , I 've been a passionate advocate of free schools and have painstakingly avoided saying or doing anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics . Yet at a stroke , I 'd somehow undone all that work . I do n't doubt that for years to come , opponents of the policy will cite my " mea culpa " as exhibit A in the case for the prosecution . <p> What pains me the most is the thought of how all my fellow free school founders will react to these misleading reports . It 's still a relatively small world and I know many of them personally . Again and again , I 've told them to keep the faith , to treat obstacles as reasons to try harder rather than give up , to stay true to their dreams . How will they respond when they read an article in The Times saying I 've " quit " because I 've changed my mind about the free schools programme ? It makes me want to weep . <p> Well , for the record , I have n't quit . I 'm going to stay on as a director of the trust and will remain involved for many years to come . The schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I visit them , as I do almost every day , it warms my heart to see how effectively the children , staff and governors have brought the founders ' original vision to life . Here are hundreds and hundreds of children from all backgrounds receiving the kind of education that 's usually reserved for the offspring of the privileged elite . Helping to set these schools up has been the most rewarding experience of my professional life and I 'd recommend it to anyone . Apart from the horrible , spite-filled critics , ready to pounce at the slightest opportunity . That bit is n't so nice , obviously . <p> If you 'd like to set up a free school , please contact the New Schools Network .
