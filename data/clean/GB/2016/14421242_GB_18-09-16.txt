ruth davidson has accused nicola sturgeon of abandoning the economic " tissue of lies " she tried to sell scots in the 2014 referendum after the first minister argued that national wealth is less important than being independent .  speaking on the second anniversary of the historic vote to save the union , the scottish conservative leader said " fantasy figures " on a separate scotland 's wealth , oil revenues and deficit had formed an integral part of the snp 's independence white paper .  but ms sturgeon used an article marking the anniversary to downplay their importance , instead arguing that the case for independence " transcends " all these factors and brexit .  ms davidson said the snp 's 2014 prospectus had been replaced with a " new mantra " that the economy does not matter and " people should just shut up about them and wrap themselves in a flag instead . "  both senior tories also highlighted a new opinion poll showing two-thirds of scots oppose a second independence referendum being staged before britain leaves the eu . out a snap referendum by stating its timing would depend on how the brexit negotiations proceed . however , he insisted that a rerun remained " highly likely " if scotland 's links to the eu are not protected .  both nationalists and unionists marked the second anniversary of the 2014 vote , with alex salmond among the speakers at a rally in glasgow and the tories setting up stalls on high streets across the country to call on the snp to rule out another referendum .  " the case for full self-government ultimately transcends the issues of brexit , of oil , of national wealth and balance sheets and of passing political fads and trends . "  she argued that scotland being pulled out of the eu against the will of 62 per cent of scots was " probably the most striking and significant instance ever " of the uk 's democratic deficit and " should be of concern to everyone . "  but ms davidson said : " the economic case for independence two years ago was a tissue of lies . fantasy figures on which fell apart under scrutiny . now everyone can see nicola sturgeon 's sums do n't add up , she 's decided to abandon them altogether .  " instead of trying to explain what would happen to our economy and how we fund our public services under independence , the new mantra is that none of these things matter anymore and people should just shut up about them and wrap themselves in a flag instead . "  speaking on the bbc 's sunday politics programme in scotland , mr mundell said : " i think it 's quite clear now that the snp position is independence at any cost . the pretence that we had two years ago that somehow independence would be economically beneficial , that it would lead to prosperity in scotland has been abandoned . "  ian murray , scottish labour 's westminster spokesman , said ms sturgeon appears to have " learned all the wrong lessons " from the leave campaign during the eu referendum by dismissing the need for economic details . he added : " what we 're talking about are people their pocket . "  the snp 's white paper on independence has been criticised over its oil revenue forecasts  alex salmond predicted on friday that a second independence referendum would be staged in autumn 2018 but a panelbase poll for the sunday times found only 33 per cent of scots want a rerun before the brexit negotiations have concluded .  it put support for independence at 48 per cent , three points higher than in the 2014 referendum but four points down on a similar poll conducted in the immediate aftermath of june 's brexit vote .  this is also far below the level of support where ms sturgeon could be assured of victory , her previous litmus test for demanding a rerun , but mr salmond intensified his pressure on her to drop her cautious stance and press ahead anyway .  the former first minister told scotland on sunday : " if i was willing to call an independence referendum in 2012 for 2014 on 27 per cent support , i 'm not certain that nicola will be too concerned about starting off with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @
