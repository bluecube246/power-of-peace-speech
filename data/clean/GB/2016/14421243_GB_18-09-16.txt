<h> Services <p> You 'd have been forgiven for doing a double take , but there really was a giant green frog driving around Wokingham this weekend . <p> Well-known community campaigner - and Bracknell News columnist - Colin Antink , was virtually unrecognisable as he toured the town , decked head to toe as the Crazy Frog , on his mobility scooter . <p> Despite Thursday night 's heavy downpour wreaking havoc across the town and beyond , Wokingham man Colin was undetered , vowing to do as many laps of the town and villages further afield , to fundraise for the Thames Hospice . <p> His mobility scooter clad with bunting and balloons , Colin embarked on a mammoth three-day trip round the town , all while playing the notoriously annoying Crazy Frog song . <p> He aimed to stay out each day for as long as his battery lasted , roughly around eight to nine hours , depending on the distance and speed at which he travelled . <p> Speaking to the News outside Wokingham Town Hall on Friday morning , Colin said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the theme trying to get everybody 's attention to fundraise for the Thames Hospice . <p> " I have absolutely no idea why or how I settled on the idea of being a frog and then to actually get out here dressed as one but never mind ! <p> " I just wish it was sunny but oh well ! <p> " To be honest even as little as a pound makes a difference though I am trying to raise about ? 1,000 . " <p> All funds raised will go to the hospice , which cares for adults with life-limiting illnesses across East Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire . <p> Colin , who suffers from Stickler Syndrome , a rare hereditary condition impacting eyesight , hearing and joints , had initially planned to travel from Wokingham to Weymouth on his scooter , but had to abandon the plans because of the scale of the project . <h> Ipsoregulated <p> This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .
