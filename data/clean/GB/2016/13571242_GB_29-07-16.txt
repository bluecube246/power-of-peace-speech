york cc captain woods hails strength in depth ahead of hull game  the men from clifton park visit hull tomorrow buoyed by a double success last weekend .  victory over castleford last saturday closed the gap on hunters ecb yorkshire premier league north leaders harrogate - whose ten match winning run was ended by driffield town - to seven points .  less than 24 hours later , york had reached the final of the black sheep yorkshire champions trophy courtesy of victory over yorkshire academy .  woods said : " we were pleased with the result against castleford and happy with the way we played - but we were even more pleased with our win over yorkshire academy .  " we had a lot of important players missing but those who stood in showed that we have a really strong second team and people are ready to step up if needed . "  all-rounder liam mckendry grabbed the headlines - hitting 87 off 97 balls - but woods also singled out wicket-keeper finlay bean who made an impressive first team debut .  woods says the game is not only an opportunity to keep pressure on harrogate but also a chance to make amends for an under-par performance when hull won by four wickets on may 14 .  " we are looking forward to it . they beat us when we played at clifton park so we will be especially up for it , " he recalled . " we did n't have a great day and they played well so we know we need to be on it . "  hull 's team includes indian slow left arm bowler shivil kaushik , 21 , who plays for gujarat lions in the indian premier league .  " last week was a good week for us . we ca n't control what harrogate do , we are just thinking about what we need to do .
