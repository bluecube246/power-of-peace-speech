<p> Reddit is always a hotbed for these sorts of discussions and revelations and one user on the social site ( named Truede ) has claimed that a few familiar faces will face the chop in Battle Of Bastards and the final Winds Of Winter . <p> He claims to have insider knowledge and says it will be a bad time for young , male heirs , revealing that both Rickon Stark and Tommen Baratheon will meet a bloody end . <p> Both Rickon Stark ( Art Parkinson ) and Tommen Baratheon ( Dean-Charles Chapman ) are going to be meeting their maker , according to a post that Truede shared on the site . <p> He wrote that " lots of major characters die " and that it will be " mostly in the finale " . <p> He very clearly spells out that Tommen will be the first to die , which certainly fits with Cerise 's predictions and visions . <p> Explaining more about Rickon 's demise he adds : " Ramsay and Jon meet across the battlefield . Ramsay releases Rickon and tells him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs , Ramsay starts shooting arrows up in the air one at a time that keep missing him . Jon starts galloping toward Rickon but just as he reaches him , one of Ramsay 's arrow hits him and he dies in Jon 's arms . " <p> We were a little wary of the information to begin with , but it seems this Truede character may have some reliable sources . He previously revealed that Osha would be killed by Ramsay and that Benjen Stark would return to save young Bran , which we saw occurring two episodes ago .
