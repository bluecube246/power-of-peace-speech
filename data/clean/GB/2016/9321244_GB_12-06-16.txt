reddit is always a hotbed for these sorts of discussions and revelations and one user on the social site ( named truede ) has claimed that a few familiar faces will face the chop in battle of bastards and the final winds of winter .  he claims to have insider knowledge and says it will be a bad time for young , male heirs , revealing that both rickon stark and tommen baratheon will meet a bloody end .  both rickon stark ( art parkinson ) and tommen baratheon ( dean-charles chapman ) are going to be meeting their maker , according to a post that truede shared on the site .  he wrote that " lots of major characters die " and that it will be " mostly in the finale " .  he very clearly spells out that tommen will be the first to die , which certainly fits with cerise 's predictions and visions .  explaining more about rickon 's demise he adds : " ramsay and jon meet across the battlefield . ramsay releases rickon and tells him runs , ramsay starts shooting arrows up in the air one at a time that keep missing him . jon starts galloping toward rickon but just as he reaches him , one of ramsay 's arrow hits him and he dies in jon 's arms . "  we were a little wary of the information to begin with , but it seems this truede character may have some reliable sources . he previously revealed that osha would be killed by ramsay and that benjen stark would return to save young bran , which we saw occurring two episodes ago .
