<h> Show cost of Hinkley on bills , say power chiefs : Suppliers fear consumers will blame them for price rises to cover ? 30bn nuclear deal <p> Energy firms want the ? 30 billion cost to consumers of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station spelled out on every household electricity bill so they can not be blamed for rising prices . <p> Rivals to France 's EDF , one of the Big Six energy providers that dominate the UK retail power supply market and which will build Hinkley Point along with backing from China 's CGN , fear being pilloried by consumers when energy bills rise after electricity from the station comes on stream in the 2020s . <p> ' The worry for the industry is that as the cost of Hinkley is added to consumers ' bills , customers will blame us when it is nothing to do with us and everything to do with the Government backing Hinkley at such huge cost , ' said one senior energy executive . ' So let 's put Hinkley Point C on the bill so we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerns : Paul Massara said the last thing he wants to see is costlier bills . Inset : how the plant will look <p> A Competition &amp; Markets Authority report this year into the energy sector said there was a ' lack of effective communication ' over the impact of Government policies and regulatory policies on domestic bills and said this must change as it had led to a ' lack of trust ' in the sector . <p> Paul Massara , the boss of renewable energy firm North Star Solar and the former chief executive of RWE Npower , said : ' Hinkley will add ? 12 to ? 45 to consumers ' annual bills , depending on who you believe . The energy industry is concerned because bills can go up when the Government slaps taxes on , even when the wholesale price of energy goes down and we get the blame . ' <p> The Government has agreed a controversial minimum price guarantee or strike price of ? 92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years , rising with inflation , for power generated by the plant , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ? 39 per Mwh . <p> Consumers will pay the difference between the wholesale price of power and the strike price if the wholesale price is lower . The National Audit Office has said the cost to consumers would be ? 30 billion -- an extra ? 30 on the average annual bill over the next 35 years , or more than ? 1,000 per household . <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> The estimated cost to consumers has risen considerably since October 2013 , when the Coalition Government agreed the strike price . The increase to consumers ' bills was expected to be just over ? 6 billion . The higher difference is primarily because the collapse in the price of oil and gas has seen the cost of wholesale energy plummet . <p> ' Remember when David Cameron said " Get rid of the green c**p " , when he wanted to cut energy bills after they became a serious political issue ? So the last thing we want to see is more costs put on bills , ' said Massara . <p> Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a range of taxes rolled up in energy bills . Environmental and social costs -- which include the cost of home insulation and help with energy bills for vulnerable households -- make up nearly 13 per cent of the average bill , while VAT adds another 4.76 per cent . The wholesale cost of electricity accounts for just 40 per cent of the average annual bill of about ? 1,200 for a family , with other costs including distribution making up the remainder . <p> Energy firms can already itemise their bills , though few do , but spelling out the cost of Hinkley Point has not been suggested before . Energy regulator Ofgem said it would not force power companies to itemise bills . ' We insist suppliers tell customers what their cheapest tariff is on bills , but bills are already complicated enough , ' it said . The Government said it had acted to keep the cost of subsidies down , ending subsidies for onshore wind power for instance . <p> Suppliers also fear domestic customers will shoulder the full burden of the strike price alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Nicholson , director of the Energy Intensive Users Group , which represents firms including chemicals , ceramics and steel plants , said some industries are entitled to subsidies under European Union rules and these could continue after Britain exits the EU . <p> ' The Government is therefore planning to exempt certain industries from most of the impact of the Hinkley strike price on their electricity bills , ' he said . ' We do n't know yet whether the UK will remain constrained by EU state aid rules after Brexit -- it is possible that the Government may be free to offer 100 per cent compensation , should it be willing to do so , though this is likely to remain unclear for months and possibly years to come . ' <p> EDF 's Hinkley Point C will be the most expensive building ever made and the rest of the energy industry is determined that it will not be blamed when consumers start paying for it . <p> The Government approved the project after a delay , prompted by security concerns over the Chinese involvement . Announcing last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put new safeguards in place to give it greater control over future critical infrastructure projects with foreign investors . <p> Ironically last week , former French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron , who until August was a member of the government that championed Hinkley , warned that Britain would find itself at the mercy of Chinese economic interests if it left the EU . ' Tomorrow you will have to deal on your own with the Chinese , and good luck to you , ' he said .
