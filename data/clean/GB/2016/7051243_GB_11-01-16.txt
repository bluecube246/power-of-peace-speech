a common type of heartburn pill has been linked to an increased risk of kidney disease , scientists warned .  those people taking proton pump inhibitors ( ppis ) are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease , a new study found .  the side effect is rare , and the study does not prove the drugs cause kidney failure , johns hopkins scientists cautioned .  however , past studies have also linked the medication to an increased kidney disease risk .  and , because tens of millions of people take the drugs each year , the association is troublesome , researchers said .  the pills are sold by prescription and over-the-counter in some countries , including under the brand names prilosec , prevacid and zegerid .  heartburn pills known as proton pump inhibitors - which are commonly sold under the brand names prilosec , prevacid and zegerid - have been linked to a higher risk of kidney disease , a new study found . ( file picture )  share this article  as a result , they are able heartburn .  scientists are n't certain how the drugs affect the kidneys .  but , prior research has linked ppis to interstitial nephritis , a form of kidney inflammation .  in this new study , the scientists analysed two large sets of data to examine the link between ppi use and kidney disease in the general population .  ppi use was linked to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease in both data sets .  however , ppi users were more likely than non-users to be overweight or be taking medication to lower cholesterol or blood pressure .  ppis work by stopping cells in the stomach lining from producing excess acid . as a result , they are able to help prevent ulcers and reduce reflux symptoms , including heartburn , depicted  high blood pressure is known to increase the risk for kidney disease .  the scientists first reviewed data on 10,482 people who were part of a study on atherosclerosis -- the hardening of the arteries .  half of those people were tracked for more than 14 years .  the people taking ppis .  doctors must weigh the risks and benefits before recommending ppis and this study adds chronic kidney disease to the risk of rare , but serious side effects associated with ppi use  dr adam schoenfeld , of university of california , san francisco  comparatively , they found 1,382 incidents among 10,160 individuals who were n't taking the pills .  and so , they determined if 1,000 ppi users were tracked for one year , they would see 14.2 new cases of chronic kidney disease .  meanwhile , there would be a rate of 10.7 new cases if 1,000 non-ppi-users were followed for a year , the scientists noted .  the study estimated that over 10 years , the absolute risk of chronic kidney disease was 11.8 per cent among ppi users .  that same risk is estimated at 8.5 per cent in nonusers .  a second analysis entailed examining data on 248,751 patients in the geinsinger health systems in pennsylvania .  half of those participants were followed for at least six years .  this time , scientists found .  in contrast , there were 28,226 incidents of the disease among 231,851 non-users .  the incident rate for ppi users was 20.1 per 1,000 person-years .  similarly , the rate for the disease was 18.3 per 1,000 person-years without the medication .  from that analysis , the scientists estimated that over 10 years , the absolute risk of chronic kidney disease among the geinsinger patients was 15.6 per cent among ppi users .  scientists looked at two sets of data that compared patients taking ppis and those who are not on the medications . in both instances , they determined ppi-users were more likely to develop chronic kidney disease ( pictured ) than those who were n't taking the pills  that same risk was only 13.9 per cent if they were n't on the medication .  however , it is possible that the ppi users had other risk factors for kidney disease that were not related to the medication , the scientists stated .  but still , the findings add to growing evidence that suggests some patients may experience dangerous side effects grady of the university of california , san francisco , in an editorial .  previous research linked the pills to kidney damage , heart problems , infections and fractures .  dr schoenfeld told reuters : ' doctors must weigh the risks and benefits before recommending ppis and this study adds chronic kidney disease to the risk of rare , but serious side effects associated with ppi use . '  he added that many people with heartburn and indigestion do n't need ppis .  lifestyle and behaviour changes -- such as getting more exercise and drinking less alcohol -- may have the same effect as the medication for mild stomach symptoms , he said .
