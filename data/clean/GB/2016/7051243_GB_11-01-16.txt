<p> A common type of heartburn pill has been linked to an increased risk of kidney disease , scientists warned . <p> Those people taking proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease , a new study found . <p> The side effect is rare , and the study does not prove the drugs cause kidney failure , Johns Hopkins scientists cautioned . <p> However , past studies have also linked the medication to an increased kidney disease risk . <p> And , because tens of millions of people take the drugs each year , the association is troublesome , researchers said . <p> The pills are sold by prescription and over-the-counter in some countries , including under the brand names Prilosec , Prevacid and Zegerid . <p> Heartburn pills known as proton pump inhibitors - which are commonly sold under the brand names Prilosec , Prevacid and Zegerid - have been linked to a higher risk of kidney disease , a new study found . ( File picture ) <h> Share this article <p> As a result , they are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartburn . <p> Scientists are n't certain how the drugs affect the kidneys . <p> But , prior research has linked PPIs to interstitial nephritis , a form of kidney inflammation . <p> In this new study , the scientists analysed two large sets of data to examine the link between PPI use and kidney disease in the general population . <p> PPI use was linked to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease in both data sets . <p> However , PPI users were more likely than non-users to be overweight or be taking medication to lower cholesterol or blood pressure . <p> PPIs work by stopping cells in the stomach lining from producing excess acid . As a result , they are able to help prevent ulcers and reduce reflux symptoms , including heartburn , depicted <p> High blood pressure is known to increase the risk for kidney disease . <p> The scientists first reviewed data on 10,482 people who were part of a study on atherosclerosis -- the hardening of the arteries . <p> Half of those people were tracked for more than 14 years . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people taking PPIs . <p> Doctors must weigh the risks and benefits before recommending PPIs and this study adds chronic kidney disease to the risk of rare , but serious side effects associated with PPI use <p> Dr Adam Schoenfeld , of University of California , San Francisco <p> Comparatively , they found 1,382 incidents among 10,160 individuals who were n't taking the pills . <p> And so , they determined if 1,000 PPI users were tracked for one year , they would see 14.2 new cases of chronic kidney disease . <p> Meanwhile , there would be a rate of 10.7 new cases if 1,000 non-PPI-users were followed for a year , the scientists noted . <p> The study estimated that over 10 years , the absolute risk of chronic kidney disease was 11.8 per cent among PPI users . <p> That same risk is estimated at 8.5 per cent in nonusers . <p> A second analysis entailed examining data on 248,751 patients in the Geinsinger Health Systems in Pennsylvania . <p> Half of those participants were followed for at least six years . <p> This time , scientists found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In contrast , there were 28,226 incidents of the disease among 231,851 non-users . <p> The incident rate for PPI users was 20.1 per 1,000 person-years . <p> Similarly , the rate for the disease was 18.3 per 1,000 person-years without the medication . <p> From that analysis , the scientists estimated that over 10 years , the absolute risk of chronic kidney disease among the Geinsinger patients was 15.6 per cent among PPI users . <p> Scientists looked at two sets of data that compared patients taking PPIs and those who are not on the medications . In both instances , they determined PPI-users were more likely to develop chronic kidney disease ( pictured ) than those who were n't taking the pills <p> That same risk was only 13.9 per cent if they were n't on the medication . <p> However , it is possible that the PPI users had other risk factors for kidney disease that were not related to the medication , the scientists stated . <p> But still , the findings add to growing evidence that suggests some patients may experience dangerous side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady of the University of California , San Francisco , in an editorial . <p> Previous research linked the pills to kidney damage , heart problems , infections and fractures . <p> Dr Schoenfeld told Reuters : ' Doctors must weigh the risks and benefits before recommending PPIs and this study adds chronic kidney disease to the risk of rare , but serious side effects associated with PPI use . ' <p> He added that many people with heartburn and indigestion do n't need PPIs . <p> Lifestyle and behaviour changes -- such as getting more exercise and drinking less alcohol -- may have the same effect as the medication for mild stomach symptoms , he said .
