<p> CARACAS Venezuela 's electoral authority on Thursday suspended the next phase of a recall referendum against unpopular President Nicolas Maduro , sparking outcry from the opposition who accused the Socialist government of dictatorial tactics . <p> The oil-rich country is mired in a brutal economic crisis that has families skipping meals amid food shortages and triple-digit inflation . Maduro , a former bus driver and union leader elected three years ago to replace late leader Hugo Chavez , has seen his popularity tumble in hand with the recession . <p> His foes had vowed to push for a recall referendum against him this year , which , if successful would have triggered fresh presidential elections that polls show Maduro would lose . <p> The election board had already said there would be no such vote this year , and appeared to put the final nail in the coffin on Thursday night . <p> Citing court orders , the electoral body said in a statement it was suspending next week 's signature drive to collect around 4 million signatures and trigger the vote . <p> Earlier on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voided an earlier signature drive by the opposition , due to fraud allegations . <p> " We hope that justice will be served and that those responsible for this swindle will be detained , " said Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello during a political rally on Thursday . <p> The Democratic Unity coalition blasted the decision , adding it would outline its action plan on Friday . <p> " We have a government of thieves using power to maintain itself , " opposition lawmaker Jorge Millan said on Twitter . <p> " But in the street the people are demanding a recall , and no one will stop us ! " <p> The opposition needed a referendum this year because under Venezuela 's constitutional rules , should Maduro lose a plebiscite next year , his vice president would take over rather than there being a new election , denying the opposition their opportunity to take power after 17 years of socialism . <p> Maduro 's rivals warn that by preventing a democratic solution to the crisis , the government is stoking chances of unrest in violent Venezuela . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis worsens , " opposition leader and two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles said on Twitter . <p> Earlier this week , Venezuela 's election board delayed an election for state governorships to 2017 from December , giving the government more breathing room before going to the polls .. <h> Next In World News <p> WASHINGTON/DELAWARE , Ohio U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would accept the result of the Nov. 8 election - " if I win " - fuelling Republican concerns his stance would make it harder for his party to maintain control of Congress . <p> GENEVA Russia has told the United Nations it will stop bombing eastern Aleppo for 11 hours a day for four days , but that is not enough to trigger a wider ceasefire deal under which militants would leave the Syrian warzone , the U.N . said on Thursday . <p> MANILA The Philippines will maintain its trade and economic ties with the United States , Trade Minister Ramon Lopez said on Friday , a day after President Rodrigo Duterte announced its " separation " from Washington . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and media division of Thomson Reuters .
