However , price per head has increased 13 fold from ? 85/head to ? 1100/head . <p> In order for a producer to have maintained the same profit they did in 1966 , they would have had to make efficiency savings of approximately 50 per cent . <p> Graham Redman , author of the Pocketbook said : " If a farm has become more efficient in the way it farms , by 1 percent per year , over 50 years , then in simple terms it will still be as profitable before subsidy as it was in 1966 . <p> " However , some costs have risen sharply as they were barely used in 1966 such as agrochemicals , and others , such as seed costs have risen by proportionately less .
