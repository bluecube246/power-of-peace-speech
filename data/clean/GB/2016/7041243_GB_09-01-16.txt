The McDiarmid pitch passed a morning inspection by match official Kevin Clancy , six days after the league fixture with Aberdeen fell victim to the deluge sweeping the east of Scotland .  And the ball had barely been touched when a revitalised Killie side snatched the lead they rarely looked like giving up against their better placed Premiership rivals , who have made their way to the League Cup semi-finals .  But in stoppage time Killie keeper Jamie McDonald had to perform heroics to conjure up three back-to-back saves to deny John Sutton , Dave Mackay and Graham Cummins an equaliser , prompting relieved colleagues to mob him at the full-time whistle .  Killie fans making the trip to Perth gave a rousing welcome before kick-off to highly-regarded winger Greg Kiltie , who had penned a contract extension earlier in the week despite interest from clubs including Reading and Hibs .  And the youngster teased a sixth-minute free-kick out of Chris Millar which paved the way to Killie 's winner .  Boosted by that early strike , a well-organised Killie defended resolutely , with Perth frustration mirrored by a caution for midfielder Murray Davidson .  Six minutes from the break , Josh Magennis must have impressed watching Northern Ireland assistant Jimmy Nicholl with two attempts in the space of 60 seconds .  His first effort was palmed round the post by fellow countryman Mannus and , from Stevie Smith 's corner , Magennis powered a dangerous header past the upright .  Killie began the second half confidently and the impressive Adam Frizzell dashed into the penalty area to head over from six yards after winger Rory McKenzie 's trickery and cross had teed-up the chance .
