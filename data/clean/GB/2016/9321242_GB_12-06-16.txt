with chinese and turkish soap flooding the market , manufacturers want the " savon de marseille " to be granted a " geographical indication " label similar to those used to safeguard the names of french wines and cheeses .  but a dispute over how true marseille soap is made has divided manufacturers into two rival camps , bitterly arguing over the definitive recipe for a product that has been made in the south of france for more than six centuries .  one group of soapmakers , led by the cosmetics giant , l'occitane , wants to allow the use of additives and perfumes as well as the traditional ingredients -- mediterranean sea water , vegetable oil and soda ash .  but the suggestion has got smaller , " craft " producers in a froth over what they see as " heresy " and a threat to their traditional method of heating the ingredients from scratch in huge cauldrons with no ready-made additives . the concoction is stirred for days and left to harden in a process that can take up to a month traditional expertise , " said marie bousquet-fabre , great-grand-niece of the founder of the marius fabre soapworks . " we are true soap makers . we start with the raw material , vegetable oil , which we transform by heating it with soda ash in our cauldrons . "  a dispute over the " official " recipe for the region 's famed traditional soap , " savon de marseille " , has producers in a frothcredit : afp  the recipe was first officially recognised in 1688 during the reign of louis xiv , the " sun king " . it was originally made with local olive oil , but even many traditionalists now mix it with cheaper palm or copra oil .  serge bruna , head of the soap manufacturer la licorne , said the " austere blocks of soap " advocated by traditionalists " are no longer what 90 per cent of consumers want " . adding lavender oil gives the soap a perfume that " for many people has come to represent the essence of marseille soap , " he said .  the traditionalists also licorne variety that is shaped like a sardine , and they want production to be strictly limited to the marseille area rather than allowed across southern france .  they have launched a petition that has gathered more than 120,000 signatures .  it is now up to the french industrial property institute to rule on what constitutes " savon de marseille " . the government hopes that protecting it with a " geographical indication " label will set a precedent for other typically gallic products such as the basque beret , limoges porcelain or laguiole knives .  but it will be difficult to reconcile the warring soap makers . an official inquiry has been launched but no decision is expected until september .
