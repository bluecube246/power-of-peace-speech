<h> Share this : <p> Councillor Bill Brown and local resident Gordon Mitchell are concerned about the amount of dog mess and litter in Kinglassie . <p> A Fife village is warning pet owners to brush up or face being shamed as part of a new project to tackle dog mess . <p> Members of Kinglassie Community Council are proposing to spray dog poo with fluorescent paint in a bid to embarrass owners that fail to clean up after their animals . <p> The problem has become intolerable for some residents , with the community council to meet next week to discuss its plans . <p> If adopted , it is hoped that the technicolour approach may be enough to convince some dog walkers to change their ways , although Sheena McGowan , secretary of the community council , said that it appeared to be a small minority that failed to clean up after their pets . <p> " It is a big problem here , especially coming out of winter time , " she said . <p> " I know that 95% of dog owners are alright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . <p> " We 're having a meeting next week and we will be discussing the idea then . <p> " It seems to have worked down in England and has cut down rates by about 75% . " <p> If adopted , fluorescent paint would be sprayed on any dog mess found on Kinglassie 's streets and in its play parks . <p> Instead of removing the poo , the measure is designed to highlight the extent of the problem , whilst embarrassing those responsible for not picking up after their pets . <p> The idea has already been adopted in one village in Aberdeenshire and several more in England , though this is believed to be the first time it will have been adopted in Fife . <p> " We really need to do something to tackle it , " said local councillor Bill Brown . <p> " I 'm strongly in favour of this approach as there is nothing worse than getting dog mess on your shoes or on the wheels of a baby 's buggy . <p> " It seems to have worked in other towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . <p> " Hopefully it can change some people 's behaviour and encourage them to take responsibility for their pets .
