Share this :  Councillor Bill Brown and local resident Gordon Mitchell are concerned about the amount of dog mess and litter in Kinglassie .  A Fife village is warning pet owners to brush up or face being shamed as part of a new project to tackle dog mess .  Members of Kinglassie Community Council are proposing to spray dog poo with fluorescent paint in a bid to embarrass owners that fail to clean up after their animals .  The problem has become intolerable for some residents , with the community council to meet next week to discuss its plans .  If adopted , it is hoped that the technicolour approach may be enough to convince some dog walkers to change their ways , although Sheena McGowan , secretary of the community council , said that it appeared to be a small minority that failed to clean up after their pets .  " It is a big problem here , especially coming out of winter time , " she said .  " I know that 95% of dog owners are alright responsible .  " We 're having a meeting next week and we will be discussing the idea then .  " It seems to have worked down in England and has cut down rates by about 75% . "  If adopted , fluorescent paint would be sprayed on any dog mess found on Kinglassie 's streets and in its play parks .  Instead of removing the poo , the measure is designed to highlight the extent of the problem , whilst embarrassing those responsible for not picking up after their pets .  The idea has already been adopted in one village in Aberdeenshire and several more in England , though this is believed to be the first time it will have been adopted in Fife .  " We really need to do something to tackle it , " said local councillor Bill Brown .  " I 'm strongly in favour of this approach as there is nothing worse than getting dog mess on your shoes or on the wheels of a baby 's buggy .  " It seems to have worked in other towns the matter .  " Hopefully it can change some people 's behaviour and encourage them to take responsibility for their pets . "
