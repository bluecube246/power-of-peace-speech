Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's life was one of maniacal productivity ...

he explained that he had " popped down to london for some chemo " , and had noticed this interesting concert of music by young composers was on . he was wearing a knitted waist-coat of a kind which used to be called ' snazzy ' , given to him by an admirer some years back , and though he was grey with fatigue he seemed almost his old self .  the quiet fortitude and undimmed curiosity of this mortally ill man were amazing , but sheer strength of character had always been one of maxwell davies 's chief traits . his life was one of almost maniacal productivity , so great that he needed several publishers just to cope with the flow .  he wrote his opera the doctor of myddfai in a mere six weeks , pausing only to eat and sleep . in his middle years he lived a life of seemingly monk-like austerity on a remote orkney island , where he had to draw his water from a well and walk several miles to buy a pint of milk ( though of boyfriends at that orkney fastness , and guests discovered he cooked wonderful pasta dishes , a skill he learned during his student days in rome in the 1950s ) .  alongside the quiet determination and fluty , slightly vicar-ish punctiliousness of speech went an exquisite courtesy . he was quite often a guest on my magazine show on bbc radio 3 in the 1990s , and i was struck by how he extended this courtesy to everyone equally , whether it was the distinguished professor in the studio , or the pa who brought his tea .  another memory is of sir peter in orkney , where he created a wonderful annual festival which still continues , and also wrote many of the children 's works which are one of his chief claims to fame .  one year i was approaching st magnus cathedral for a concert , and at a distance i caught a glimpse of some elderly worthies standing at the entrance , all wearing the same jackets and ties , all caught in the setting son . they looked like members of the town of them turned out to be sir peter .  like richard hoggart and david hockney , he was a lower-middle-class northern boy made good . that 's why he was so determined to pass on the values of high culture to the next generation .  it 's hard to square this sight with my early memories of maxwell davies conducting his group the fires of london , when he wore flower-power shirts , knitted ponchos and red shoes , and had a mop of curly hair as unruly as the young simon rattle 's .  only a few years previously his st thomas wake : foxtrot for orchestra had caused a scandal when it was performed at the proms , and even more so in germany . the most notorious of these early works was eight songs for a mad king , which evoked the madness of king george iii in an expressionist style of nerve-shredding intensity .  it 's easy to say that he simply turned from radical youngster to conservative , but the steely blue eyes and determined jaw of the old man showed that anger in him , which spilled over briefly in the satirical fury of those works of the 1960s and early 1970s .  religion was often the target , and yet he revered latin christian culture of the middle ages , and drew on it all his life . in later life he seemed to become reconciled to the church , and even wrote some liturgical pieces . the satirical edge mostly vanished , as the tremendous calm landscape of orkney , his adopted home , and his increasing immersion in the classical tradition of music brought a kind of peace . the anger still blazed up occasionally , but it had turned political . in the 1970s he wrote a satirical yellow cake review , aimed at the uranium mining companies who were all set to invade orkney , and in my last interview with him he raged against the iraq war , a topic which he wove into the 9th symphony .  brilliant and disturbing though the expressionist and satirical pieces are , the heart of peter maxwell davies 's music for me lies in those radiant works at the same time . you catch that quality in earlier works like the 2nd taverner fantasia , inspired by the music of the great tudor composer john tavener , and in the best of the symphonies .  in the later works , the harsh and beautiful landscape of orkney shines through the austere play of lines , an influence maxwell davies himself pointed out .  this feeling for landscape shows that though maxwell davies may have started off as a european modernist in the making , the composer who eventually emerged was actually very english . he was english in other ways too . like richard hoggart and david hockney , he was a lower-middle-class northern boy made good . that 's why he was so determined to pass on the values of high culture to the next generation . he knew their worth , because he 'd had to fight so hard to win them for himself . that gave him an authority which is all too rare in cultural life nowadays ; which is another reason to mourn his passing .
