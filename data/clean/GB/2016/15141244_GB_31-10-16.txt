the band tell teamrock : " so many thoughts . so many words . so much left unsaid . this road is the closing song on our record and is the completion of a cycle that seems perpetual . habits and inconsistencies , and our attempt to wrestle with them and make sense of each other as individuals .  " on stage is where we do our best work and this live session is a window into capturing that momentum -- a place to shed our skin , open up , and evolve . we 've always got more in us and we plan to do more of these sessions in the future . hope you like it .
