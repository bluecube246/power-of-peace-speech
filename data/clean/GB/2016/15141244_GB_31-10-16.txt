<p> The band tell TeamRock : " So many thoughts . So many words . So much left unsaid . This Road is the closing song on our record and is the completion of a cycle that seems perpetual . Habits and inconsistencies , and our attempt to wrestle with them and make sense of each other as individuals . <p> " On stage is where we do our best work and this live session is a window into capturing that momentum -- a place to shed our skin , open up , and evolve . We 've always got more in us and we plan to do more of these sessions in the future . Hope you like it . "
