" this reckless disregard for such an ancient rule has resulted in poor witnesses complaining of symptoms including shock , speechlessness and nausea .  " gentlemen - please respect the law and keep taps oan . failure to do so fashion division . "  the post has been shared by thousands of facebook users , with one joking : " good on lanarkshire police division having a laugh . people take things far too seriously nowadays ..... things like ' you should be out keeping the streets safe instead of doing silly things on facebook ' ..... get a life .... this shows that these guys who do a great job have a sense of humour and like a laugh like the rest of us ! ! "  another joked : " i 'm afraid this is a national problem . there have been several sightings of taps aff in dumfries over the last few days . the reckless conduct of these individuals beggars belief . on one occasion the temperature was only 14 degrees . something must be done before there is an epidemic .
