Scottish police post cheeky note warning men about taking their tops off  Police in Scotland showed a sense of humour while maintaining law and order with a Facebook post jokingly warning men against taking off their tops .  Lanarkshire Police Division , in the Central Lowlands of Scotland , joked about worrying reports of men taking their " taps off " Scottish vernacular as a result of recent warm weather north of the border .  They said they had , " received numerous worrying reports of a bizarre side effect following the continued presence of a strange yellow object in the sky all week " .  The light-hearted post added : " It would appear that some men have gone topless in clear contravention of Lanarkshire bylaws , which explicitly restrict the practice to ' Taps aff at 20 ' .  " This reckless disregard for such an ancient rule has resulted in poor witnesses complaining of symptoms including shock , speechlessness and nausea .  " Gentlemen - please respect the law and keep taps oan . Failure to do so Fashion Division . "  The post has been shared by thousands of Facebook users , with one joking : " Good on Lanarkshire police division having a laugh . People take things far too seriously nowadays ..... things like ' you should be out keeping the streets safe instead of doing silly things on Facebook ' ..... get a life .... this shows that these guys who do a great job have a sense of humour and like a laugh like the rest of us ! ! "  Another joked : " I 'm afraid this is a national problem . There have been several sightings of Taps Aff in Dumfries over the last few days . The reckless conduct of these individuals beggars belief . On one occasion the temperature was only 14 degrees . Something must be done before there is an epidemic . "
