services  ' serious ' interest in buying into kelty land art  it was described as " one of the most exciting public art projects scotland has ever seen " and was set to transform an ugly hole in the ground next to the m90 at kelty .  the multi-million pound restoration plans for the st ninians opencast coal mine centred on turning the area into a major tourist attraction which would bring visitors and money into the village .  world renowned american architect charles jencks designed the fife earth project and work started but it was left unfinished when scottish coal went bust in 2013 .  three years on and there 's a shaft of light at the end of the tunnel with reports of " two serious inquiries " from potential investors .  lochs councillor alex campbell said : " anything that 's for the betterment of the area , such as jobs or a new leisure and recreation use , has to be positive .  " they 've spoken about several ideas for that area , an m&amp;d factories , it 's all been mentioned but there 's never been anything concrete .  " they 've seemingly been talking to investors but we 'll have to see what happens . if there 's any form of investment or employment i would be more than willing to support it subject to the correct infrastructure and everything being in place . "  hargreaves stepped in to finish the excavation of coal and restoration of the site but the land art was not completed as originally intended .  cllr campbell added : " right now people use it for walking and cycling but there is some doubt about what will happen , given the land art was never completed after scottish coal went bust .  " i do have some safety concerns about the pond , i 'm worried about kids getting in there , so it would be good for that issue to be sorted too . "  " the council has an ongoing dialogue with the company and we 're keen to maximise the economic development potential of the various sites they own in the a masterplan setting out their aspirations for the site , it will be subject to normal planning processes , and public consultation . "  no-one from hargreaves was available to comment .  speaking to the press in 2014 , mr jencks had said : " one can only hope the whole project will be revived . never say never . "  he added : " the facts are that our project was inexpensive , saved the company much money in restoration , celebrated scotland history and diaspora and would have been completed except that many coal companies went to the wall , including the one who asked me to do this restoration . "  plans for the 665-acre park were announced in 2009 and included four different-shaped landscape mounds -- one conical , one triangular , one rectangular and one horn-shaped -- which represented the continents scotland had influenced in history and the 40 million people of scots descent overseas .  the site was to feature more than six miles of walkways , a large open water body with dramatic cliffs and a scotland-shaped loch , the future economy of kelty and the surrounding area .  ipsoregulated  this website and associated newspapers adhere to the independent press standardards organisations 's editors ' code of practice . if you have a compaint about editorial content which relates to inaccuracy or intrusion , then please contact the editor here . if you are dissatisfied with the response provided you can contact ipso here
