Teachers, share your thoughts and experiences of the Prevent agenda

Since July last year , schools have been given a legal duty to prevent students from being drawn into terrorism . Government guidance specifies that this includes " non-violent extremism which can create an atmosphere conducive to terrorism and can popularise views which terrorists exploit " .  Some warn that teachers , who are already overworked , are being asked to do yet more ; others worry that they 're being turned into spies , which could damage trust in the school community . There are also fears that schools feel obliged to report incidents , even when this might not be appropriate . High profile cases where students have been questioned for seemingly benign comments -- such as using the term " ecoterrorist " in a discussion about environmental activism -- have done little to boost confidence in the government guidelines .  We want to hear teachers ' side of the story :  Have you received Prevent training ? If so , how useful did you find it ?  How practical are the obligations for teachers to implement ?  Have you comment or behaved in a way that could be deemed " extremist " according to the Prevent agenda ? Did you feel under pressure to report the incident to a senior leader , or the police ?  Are you more or less likely to discuss controversial topics , such as extremism , as a result of Prevent ?
