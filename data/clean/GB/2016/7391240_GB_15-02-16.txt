since july last year , schools have been given a legal duty to prevent students from being drawn into terrorism . government guidance specifies that this includes " non-violent extremism which can create an atmosphere conducive to terrorism and can popularise views which terrorists exploit " .  some warn that teachers , who are already overworked , are being asked to do yet more ; others worry that they 're being turned into spies , which could damage trust in the school community . there are also fears that schools feel obliged to report incidents , even when this might not be appropriate . high profile cases where students have been questioned for seemingly benign comments -- such as using the term " ecoterrorist " in a discussion about environmental activism -- have done little to boost confidence in the government guidelines .  we want to hear teachers ' side of the story :  have you received prevent training ? if so , how useful did you find it ?  how practical are the obligations for teachers to implement ?  have you comment or behaved in a way that could be deemed " extremist " according to the prevent agenda ? did you feel under pressure to report the incident to a senior leader , or the police ?  are you more or less likely to discuss controversial topics , such as extremism , as a result of prevent ?
