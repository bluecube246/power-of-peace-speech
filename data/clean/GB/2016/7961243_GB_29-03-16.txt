Up to half of people killed by US police are disabled

<p> Not only are the total numbers of police-involved deaths in the US appalling -- 1,134 in 2015 alone -- the final tally for the year highlighted once again the shockingly disproportionate number of African Americans affected , as was exposed by a Guardian investigation , The Counted . Young black men aged between 15 and 34 accounted for 15% of all deaths logged ( five times higher than for their white counterparts ) , despite being just 2% of the population . <p> There is another , much less well-documented feature of police brutality and violence : the prevalence of disabled people and , in particular , those with mental difficulties , who are victims . <p> Raising public awareness is vital to build pressure for change on this link between police aggression and disability <p> The report , compiled by David M Perry , a professor of history at Dominican University in Illinois , and long-time disability rights activist Lawrence Carter-Long , makes use of available data ( there are no official , comprehensive statistics collected on police-based violence and disability at local , state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media to shine a light on the problem . <p> After examining coverage over the past three years , Perry and Carter-Long say it is shocking that the prevalence of disability is not being accurately , or commonly , reported . " Media coverage of police violence fails to recognise or report the disability element when Americans are injured or killed by law enforcement , resulting in their stories being segregated from the issue in the media , " they conclude . <p> Raising public awareness is vital to build pressure for change , and this is urgently needed in demonstrating the links between police aggression and disability . We know from campaigning work in the UK and the US that encountering the police or criminal justice system can be an extremely traumatic , confusing and , at worst , deadly experience for someone with a serious mental health problem or with intellectual disabilities . <p> For example , if a person 's ability to communicate is significantly impaired , be it by psychosis , autism or dementia , and responding officers are ill-equipped to identify or adequately engage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In both countries -- despite a number of positive initiatives , including the Crisis Care Concordat in Britain , attempts to improve police training as well as the introduction in some places of " street triage " , where health professionals accompany police on calls -- the injury and death of vulnerable citizens after being restrained has been an enduring and shameful occurrence . <p> As the Rudderman report says , it is beholden on police and policymakers in the US to fully track what is happening and develop effective , long-term responses . <p> In Britain , the National Appropriate Adult Network has repeatedly stressed that vulnerable people throughout the justice system , including the courts , need to have their welfare and rights better protected . <p> There is an indisputable onus on those with the power to protect vulnerable people from abuse and violence , wherever it is perpetrated , to take action . However , the media have to play their part too by exposing when and how the system betrays them . If we do n't , as Perry said when the Rudderman paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from tragedies , identify patterns , and implement necessary reforms " . <p> Mary O'Hara writes on social affairs and is author of Austerity Bites .
