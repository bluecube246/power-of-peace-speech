<h> Graziano Pelle thrown out of Italy squad for refusing to shake manager 's hand <p> By Eurosport <p> 16 hours ago <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 0 <h> Italy boss Giampiero Ventura has excluded Graziano Pelle from Italy 's next match with Macedonia after the striker refused his handshake when substituted . <p> The Shandong Luneng forward issued an apology on instagram , but it appears that this was too little , too late for his veteran coach . <p> After starting the World Cup qualifying match with Spain , Pelle was substituted on 59 minutes , but will now miss the next game with Macedonia on Sunday . <p> Pelle 's apology read as follows : <p> " Oh yes ! Unfortunately , I 've done a stupid thing again ? ? . It was unacceptable bit of behaviour , against the coach in the first place and also to my team-mates , who have always shown themselves to have important values ? ? within a great ITALY group in which we belong . " <p> " As with all serious errors , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take responsibility for the incident . It 's only right to submit my heartfelt apologies to everyone . " <p> Ventura had initially appeared to play down the incident even before the former Southampton player had apologised . <p> " Pelle was angry , I think this was not so much because of the substitution as the way we had played up to that point , " he said after the game . <p> " It 's part of football , it 's something I 've seen many times in my career . But when you wear the Italy shirt , you need to be careful . " <p> But he clearly did n't able to leave it at that , and the decision was made to axe the 31-year-old player from the squad . <p> The FIGC released a statement to the press , in which they confirmed the decision , and added that Pelle would return to his parent club in China : <p> " The coach Gian Piero Ventura , in agreement with the FIGC , has decided to exclude the player Graziano Pell ? from the squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 in Skopje , for disrespectful behavior at the time of his substitution during the match yesterday with Spain . <p> " To be part of the Italy squad involves the sharing of values that are befitting of the national team , starting with showing respect towards the staff , teammates and fans . The player will return today to his parent club . " <h> OUR VIEW <p> On first hearing this story , we thought it seemed unnecessarily harsh . It seems quite a punishment for what could have been an accidental or inadvertent . <p> But then we saw the video . This was pretty outrageous behaviour - and Pelle 's statement admitted as much . <p> After all , how hard is it to do a handshake ? Unless you play for Manchester United , that is.
