OnePlus ' third handset emerges as the ... OnePlus 3 !  The OnePlus 2 has been out a little while now , long enough that OnePlus has actually terminated the invite-only sales model for the device , meaning anyone can cruise over to the OnePlus webstore and buy one straight up . That can pretty much only mean one thing - a successor is already in the works for launch inside 2016 - but then , given the way we know the smartphone industry works and how in-advance development cycles are , this is hardly suprising news .  In the meantime , OnePlus has reduced the cost of its OnePlus 2 handset to $349 -- and it is staying that way forever . Here 's what the company had to say about the price reduction on its official blog :  " We learned a lot from our first flagship phone . The invite system helped get the OnePlus 2 off the ground , and now thanks to both timing and scale , our operations have sized up to the Goldilocks principle of just right in celebrating the fruits of our labor ? The OnePlus 2 now has a price modification of $349 , forever . If you 've ever needed to give a friend another reason to join Team OnePlus , here you go . "  The company also released the OnePlus X earlier in 2015 and that handset , while nowhere near as compelling as the OnePlus 2 , is still generating quite a bit of interest from consumers . The OnePlus 2 flagship was not without its detractors , however , following the company 's decision NOT to include NFC , a fingerprint scanner or a QHD panel on the front of the device .  The OnePlus 3 , like every other flagship before it from the Chinese upstart , will almost certainly be released inside the company 's now infamous invite-only purchasing program , whereby users have to first get an invite before they can buy an actual phone from OnePlus . This process cuts out networks and retailers and allows the company to exercise better control of the handset 's production process , rather just building a few million area -- well , two actually -- OnePlus could score an easy win is to do with NFC and QHD display panels . I 'm not too fussed about NFC , though I know a lot of people would like to see it included . For that reason and that reason alone , OnePlus should include it on the OnePlus 3 . Ditto Type-C USB for charging . Yes , I know it 's a bit annoying at present but it will become A LOT more common in 2016/7 , so it is best to be prepared .  The handset will likely feature 3GB of RAM and Qualcomm 's soon-to-be-unleashed Snapdragon 820 CPU . Beyond this we 'd expect to see some big improvements to imaging and battery performance , likely a larger cell , as well as the introduction of a QHD display panel , another key spec missing from last year 's OnePlus 2 .  OnePlus 3 Release Date  February 25 sees some more details emerge - this time we have OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei talking to CNET about the forthcoming flagship , saying that it the report . Pei said that the phone will feature a " new design " which he hopes will " captivate " consumers as much as the original OnePlus One . It would appear that although the OnePlus 2 was more feature-rich and sold better than the OnePlus One , OnePlus feels that on the design front it lost some of the charm compared to the debut model .  First Benchmarks For OnePlus 3 Land  The OnePlus 3 is expected to get official in May with a release date following in the weeks after . Up to now details about 2016 's " flagship killer " have been pretty thin on the ground but as is often the case in the run up to a launch , leaks are starting to occur -- leaks like benchmarks which detail the specs of the handset .  According to recent GFX and Geekbench test results , the OnePlus 3 will have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor , 4GB or 6GB of RAM , 64GB of storage , a 16-megapixel camera , an 8-megapixel front camera and NFC support . In addition of Oxygen OS .  The chassis of the handset is expected to be constructed from metals and feature a fingerprint scanner as standard . Furthermore , OnePlus many retail the OnePlus 3 with different screen sizes : 5-inch , 5.2-inch and 5.5-inch options have been named in benchmarks and reports . If true , this would be the biggest and most complex launch the company has ever undertaken , proving , if successful , that it is now one of the big dogs in the phone space .  Why the handset will feature up to 6GB of RAM is anybody 's guess . KYM has speculated that this mount of RAM could have something to do with an Android N/Chrome OS cross-over initiative that we 'll see announced later on in 2016 . Or , it could just be because they can -- Android has always been ALL ABOUT the specs . Either way , the OnePlus 3 is shaping up to be quite a beast . Let 's just hope OnePlus manages to keep the price in line with expectations .  OnePlus 3 Design  Oneplus is kind of its thing ; the whole transparency and openess with its own community of fans via social media and its own forum line . That 's worked very well in the past for generating plenty of interest in its devices . Sometimes though , leaksters still beat OnePlus to the punch and reveal a new handset before the firm is necessarily ready to say " hey , look what we 're working on " . And on that note , images have now appeared online showing 3D renders of the next-gen device .  The leak comes via Mobile Dad , and the images appear to show a brushed metal back panel design which may or may not be part of a unibody . If so , this would be a departure from OnePlus ' design conventions for the flagship so far , which have previously involved interchangeable back panels in a variety of materials , including kevlar , denim , and wood . That said , using a metal panel at all is also departure as we have n't seen this until now . It 's also worth noting to showcase the firm 's premium design , placing this as a higher priority over even the specs - but even that device used glass or ceramic ( depending on which variant you opted for ) rather than a largely metal build .  Meanwhile , on the front there is no longer a fingerprint scanner and instead we have a front-facing speaker grille which may provide stereo sound similar to HTC 's BoomSound setup , though this is merely speculation . The source for the images also claims the handset will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip and a 1080p display - although we 've no idea of the size of the handset or the display diagonal . There 's also no word on RAM or any other specs , including the camera .  As of February 18 , a video has leaked showcasing the OnePlus 3 's design and a few of its features . TimesNews reports having received a tip from an unnamed source with videos and images of the new device . A photo included shows the handset in the flesh , but the video and 's claimed these are ' official ' images that have been unearthed early and are not made by third party 3D artists .  The design seems to have changed a bit , with a curvier shape featuring a metal frame and what looks like a brushed metal back panel , and it seems to have a fingerprint scanner . The report estimates it has a 5.5in display and there is some indication we might see a Type-C USB port .  " The rumored specifications of the device includes a 5.5-inch 1080p display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection and is expected to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor . It will have two variants : 4GB RAM and 16GB inbuilt storage and 5GB RAM with 64GB inbuilt storage . It is expected to run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow based Oxygen OS out of the box . "
