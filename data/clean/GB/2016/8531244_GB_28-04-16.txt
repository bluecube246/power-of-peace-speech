the son of a survivor who became a royal portraitist  as a matter of protocol , the queen never comments publicly on any of her official portraits . for some artists this could be a blessing , as during her 63-year reign there have been many commissioned likenesses that were less than complimentary , the most notable by the late lucian freud , whose miserable depiction of the monarch in miniature divided public opinion in 2001 .  the queen as ever was silent on the matter , though it is hard to imagine her suppressing her emotions when she first saw the 9ft x 11ft portrait by australian-jewish artist ralph heimans which was commissioned for the diamond jubilee in 2012 . as he was commissioned shortly afterwards to do a drawing for the royal collection , heimans knew he had hit the mark and elizabeth ii 's tacit approval was confirmed when the dean of westminster abbey purchased the painting , which will be the centrepiece in the new queen 's diamond jubilee galleries .  heimans in his studio : his meeting with the a tie ' .  set to open in 2018 , the abbey 's medieval triforium has been hidden to the public for more than 700 years and as well as offering visitors a rare view of the palace of westminster , there will be treasures and collections from the abbey 's 1,000-year history . now heimans ' painting officially titled the coronation theatre , westminster abbey : a portrait of her majesty queen elizabeth ii , will be part of that history , a mighty achievement for the 46-year-old son of a holocaust survivor from sydney 's north shore .  four years on and with all media attention focused on the queen 's 90th birthday last week , heimans , who now lives permanently in london with his wife tami and daughters ellie rose , five , and hannah , four , ca n't help but reflect think on his own surreal meeting at buckingham palace for the paint job of the decade .  " who could forget being at the palace watching the queen advance down a long corridor , attended by footmen and wearing the robe heimans , recalling his big moment in exalted company . " i only had one hour with her in the yellow drawing room , which is where she always poses . as time was so short , i took photographs of her instead of sketching . i also described to her the reflective mood i wanted the painting to convey and told her that i wanted the setting to be westminster abbey because of the historical significance and with her standing on the 13th-century cosmati pavement as she and all her ancestors did for their coronations . "  a detail of the queen 's portrait  with a career in portraiture spanning 29 years , heimans knows when his subject is relaxed and approving of his concept and this was the case with the queen , whom he describes as a " fantastic sitter " . interestingly , heimans , who was suited and booted for his encounter ( " the only time i 've ever worn a tie " ) was told to say ' may i take control now ma'am ' once the queen was in situ , with royalty , he let her majesty lead .  " she did , however , stand for 10 minutes wearing the robe of state which is remarkable considering its weight and she understood all i hoped to achieve , " adds heimans , who understandably knew a great deal more about the queen 's family than she did about his . given more time over the cucumber sandwiches , he reckons he might have told her about his mother josette fleeing from lebanon in 1956 ahead of the civil war , when anti-jewish hostilities were at their height , or talked about his father frank , who was born while his parents were in hiding in holland under nazi occupation .  howard jacobson : ' this guy 's face is fascinating '  " unlike so many of our other family members who were taken to the camps , my grandparents were protected by a catholic brother and sister in the small village of tilbury who saved their lives and which enabled them to leave after liberation , " says heimans . " resettled in australia in 1955 , jewish history , which led him to make a film in ' 86 about theresienstadt called paradise camp . "  though he is a traditionalist only when it comes to his painting , heimans ' faith is very important to him and the high holy days are honoured , though it is his love of conceptual themes that led him in his early years to paint the portrait of an auschwitz survivor . capturing the very essence of his many subjects in the surrounds of their life story has made heimans a sought-after portraitist in his homeland where he was awarded the order of australia moa , but living in herne hill now has also boosted his uk commissions , some of them jewish related .  howard jacobson is one and in a style reminiscent of the great dutch masters , heimans painted the author 's portrait ahead of the release of his book shylock is my name . " the moment i met him i thought ' i must paint this guy because his face is fascinating ' , " says heimans , who has gone on to in prose to mark the 400th anniversary of the bard 's death this month . jewish authors tracy chevalier ( girl with the pearl earring ) and gillian flynn ( gone girl ) are among the subjects who are on show and with brush still in hand heimans is now capturing shakespearean actors dame judi dench and sir ben kingsley .  time spent with any of them can never compare with 60 minutes with the queen , but heimans ' memory is preserved forever on canvas .
