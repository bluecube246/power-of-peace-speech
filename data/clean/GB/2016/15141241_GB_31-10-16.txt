<h> Mixed reality : A review of Microsoft 's Hololens <p> The consumer will need time to get used to it and the technology will have to improve - as it will - going forward to ensure that mixed reality devices like Microsoft 's Hololens really do transform the way we operate in society <p> The demonstration included an overview of the technology , various industry scenario demonstrations to see what opportunities there are for technology companies , and an opportunity for Information Age to try the device . <p> Having been fairly new to the technology industry when I first entered Microsoft 's demo room I was expecting something entirely different to what Hololens presented . <p> I expected a totally immersive , virtual experience . Instead the other journalists and I were given a mixed reality experience , a connection between the physical and virtual worlds . A blend of reality and digital . <p> The Hololens creates an artificial sensory experience like something out of a sci-fi film , albeit a basic one . <p> The new offering from Microsoft projects holograms into real time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-in-one device . <p> What do I mean by this ? Well the Hololens comes fully equipped with everything needed to have a semi-immersive virtual experience , there is no need for headphones , for example , it is all built into the headset . <h> Game-changer <p> The device contains the world 's first self-contained holographic computer , with 2 environment sensors and 1 depth sensor that allow it to process real-time information . ' what we call spatial mapping ' , said Leila Martine , director of product marketing at Microsoft , to Information Age . <p> ' The masterful ' holographing processing unit ( HPU ) , according to Martine , allows for a detailed interaction between the real world and holograms . <p> I must admit , when trying out the Hololens I was impressed . The holograms were clear and interactive with a variety of business applications obvious . Although the technology does have some way to go . <p> ' We are at the beginning of journey , ' said Martine , ' but already the journey is exciting , with significant possibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft <h> My experience <p> The other journalists and I were given two Hololens demos to try out . <p> The first was being used by Case Western Reserve University for education purposes . <p> HoloLens allowed me to see the human body in good detail , and took me through different parts of the body . <p> You could walk around the 3D human body and control what layer you saw : muscles , veins , organs etc . <p> The technology 's aim in this field is to transform the way anatomy is taught and to further understand the human body in preparing the next generation of doctors . <p> It was impressive , but there are no tangible results yet to show what impact it has . Having said this , Case Western are developing a curriculum based on this technology . <p> The second demo highlighted how 3D visualisation can bring storytelling to life in interactive new ways -- be that a presentation , sales tool , or education scenario . For example , the headset allows you to see where your audience ( if making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and suggests ways for you to improve consumer interaction . <p> I felt this was incredibly powerful in demonstrating what Hololens could offer . It was captivating and provides the user with a range of possibilities in transforming business . <h> ' The art of possibility ' <p> A nice soundbyte from Martine as she described how the Hololens and future upgrades has the capability to ' change and transform the business process ' . <p> The Developer Edition costs ? 2,719 so it is not for commercial use , Microsoft is targeting businesses to transform aspects of their daily operations in creative ways . <p> Businesses can add tailored apps to the Developer Hololens , and be taught to optimise its use at Microsoft 's holographic academy . <p> The benefits are varied . ' Geography is no longer an inhibitor , ' said Martine , and it will save time , save money and reduce the manufacturing process . <h> Seeing is believing <p> I was lucky enough to try the Hololens , and it is important to see how it is used in business applications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing the technology and the possibilities it presents in action : <p> Volvo Cars <p> Volvo is using the Hololens to give customers a sensor 's vantage point to configuring cars in entirely new ways , allowing them to view car features in new , never-before-seen ways . Microsoft HoloLens : Partner Spotlight with Volvo Cars <p> Trimble <p> Trimble 's ground-breaking innovations help architecture and construction industry professionals do their jobs better . Microsoft HoloLens has the ability to extend Trimble tools , by bringing 3D models to life as full-scale holograms and creating new ways to communicate and collaborate with remote teams across the globe . <p> It is easy to see why , but for all its benefits the technology is still in its very early stages . The field of vision on the Hololens , for example , was limited to an extent . <p> The consumer will need time to get used to it and the technology will have to improve -- as it will -- going forward to ensure that mixed reality devices like Microsoft 's Hololens really do transform the way we operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since its launch in 1995 , Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm .
