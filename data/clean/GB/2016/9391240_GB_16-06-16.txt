<h> Quick links <h> Follow us on <h> A fan has worked out that Arya definitely should have died on this week 's Game of Thrones <p> According to the medical science of Westeros <p> ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW <p> By Huw Fullerton <p> Thursday 16 June 2016 at 11:50AM <p> Game of Thrones is full of fantastical elements from fire-breathing dragons and the evil White Walkers to face-changing assassins and time-travelling young boys , and it 's safe to say they add a lot to what fans enjoy about the series . <p> However , it 's also safe to say that fans really DO N'T enjoy when the series becomes implausible in more prosaic ways , such as when this week 's episode saw Arya Stark ( Maisie Williams ) more or less walking off a vicious stomach stabbing after being patched up by an actress . <p> Now , one dedicated fan has taken to reddit to lay out exactly why her survivial is irritating -- because based on what we 've seen of wounds in Game of Thrones before , she should have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arya 's injury to similar fatal ones inflicted on Talisa Stark ( Oona Chaplin ) , King Robert Baratheon ( Mark Addy ) and Khal Drogo ( Jason Momoa ) , as well as non-fatal wounds acquired by characters like Theon ( Alfie Allen ) , Jaime ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ) and the Hound ( Rory McCann ) . <p> Generally speaking , characters with as severe a wound as Arya 's either died immediately ( Talisa ) , were immediately bedbound and incapable of doing the kind of parkour/fighting Arya displayed ( King Robert ) or succumbed to infection ( Khal Drogo ) , with even characters who survived shown in the series to have severe risk from infection or septicaemia ( Jaime , the Hound ) . <p> And considering Arya fell in a filthy river straight after her stabbing , the post concludes that she should have met her maker within hours , no matter how good a physician the actor who patched her up was ( after all , Grand Maester Pycelle could n't save King Robert ) . Even if the Waif missed every major artery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the infection would have been enough to finish her off . <p> As the post sums up : <p> Oh , and the writer also had a great response to those who would point out that Arya 's survival was n't the least likely thing to ever happen on Game of Thrones . <p> So there you have it -- Arya 's survival is even less likely than that whole Waif/Arya Fight Club theory everyone was talking about last week , and by all rights she should be a new face on the wall of the House of Black and White . Who knew Game of Thrones could be so soppy about keeping its characters alive ? <p> Game of Thrones continues on Sky Atlantic this Monday at 2am and 9:00pm <p> We use cookies to improve your experience of our website .
