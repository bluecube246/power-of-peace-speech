The party has maintained throughout that election expenses have been recorded in accordance with the law , including in South Thanet where UKIP leader Nigel Farage was defeated by conservative Craig MacKinlay .  Battle bus  David Cameron was asked by Andrew Marr last Sunday if he authorised the payment of a QC to try to halt that police inquiry .  The prime minister said : " We , like many other parties , had a national battle bus that went to lots of constituencies .  " That bus and the expenses with it , in our view , and in the view incidentally of the Labour party , the Liberal party and others ; all treated those as national expenses . I think that is the right approach .  " I am absolutely convinced we can answer satisfactorily all the questions that people are asking . "
