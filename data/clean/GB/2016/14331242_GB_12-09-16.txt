<h> Big Ben throws , Antonio Brown twerks and Steelers roll <p> play <p> Roethlisberger , Brown and Williams shine in Steelers ' victory ( 1:31 ) <p> Jon Gruden and Sean McDonough break down the contributions Ben Roethlisberger , Antonio Brown and DeAngelo Williams made for the Steelers in their victory over the Redskins on Monday Night Football . ( 1:31 ) <h> What you need to know in the NFL <p> The Steelers certainly look ready for the Cincinnati Bengals in what promises to be a bruising clash on Sunday at Heinz Field . <p> Think about it : The Steelers were without several key offensive players on the road against a 2015 playoff team and still posted 437 offensive yards and five touchdowns . That included teardrop dimes of 29 and 25 yards from Ben Roethlisberger to Brown , who mistreated cornerback Bashaud Breeland relentlessly . <p> Curiously , Brown did n't get the Redskins ' best corner , Josh Norman , for much of the game . Norman stayed on the left side of the field for quite a bit of the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Steelers " did n't care where Norman was ' on the field because they do n't have control over that , a thought Brown echoed when he said after the game : " Trying to beat the man across from me . " <p> Roethlisberger and Brown have connected on 500 passes in their careers , and some things they run , particularly by the sideline , are difficult for any corner to cover . <p> Through touchdowns and mistakes , the Steelers will play fearlessly all year . <p> " We 're not afraid to take chances , " said quarterback Ben Roethlisberger about his offense , which converted two fourth-and-shots , one for a touchdown . " That 's just who we are . " <p> The Steelers ' most important number from Monday might be 143 : DeAngelo Williams ' rushing yards total after a 26-carry , two-touchdown night . Williams had everything working , including a backbreaking 15-yard touchdown run as he split two defenders like a point guard . <p> When games get tight , the Steelers feel they can utilize a stout offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first touchdown with a 73-yard , run-heavy drive . If the passing windows close because of Cincinnati 's defense this week , Williams could see 20-plus carries once again . <p> The Steelers will be tested more than this . Washington failed to stretch the field offensively , with DeSean Jackson 's 33-yard reception the Redskins ' only play of more than 20 yards all evening . <p> But Pittsburgh played to its formula defensively , and it worked : Give Washington the short stuff , shade on tight end Jordan Reed and tighten up once close to the red zone . This will be a theme . <p> That the Steelers failed to record a sack and still kept an above-average Redskins offense to 16 points suggests this group has grown . <p> They could have had an off night and it would n't have mattered . <p> The Steelers picked up where they left off in the 2015 regular season : With 30-plus points . <h> Sponsored Headlines <p> Comments <h> ABOUT COOKIES <p> We use cookies to help make this website better , to improve our services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of cookies and change your browser settings in order to avoid cookies by clicking here .
