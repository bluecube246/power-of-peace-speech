Poetry slam star will raise the roof for church in dire need of a new one  PARISHIONERS in Great Somerford are going all out to save their parish church roof with a major fundraising effort .  Grade 1 listed St Peter and St Paul is in desperate need of a new roof and worshippers have been told it will not last another winter .  So they have organised a series of fundraisers in a bid to replace it , including a village bake off , and a poetry slam by Edinburgh Festival star Henry Baker , the Sunshine Kid .  Churchwarden Alison Davies explained : " The estimate including professional fees is a little over ? 200,000 , of which we have raised nearly ? 85,000 since Christmas from donations , sale of roof tiles , charitable trusts and events - no mean feat . "  But she stressed : " This contract needs to start in September because we have bats roosting in the roof , which need to be rehoused before they hibernate and because the roof will not stand grant applications which should provide the bulk of the shortfall . Meantime we are all out to up the fund . "  Among the programme of events in the next few days are a Little Gardens of Great Somerford , which includes a children 's trail . Tickets cost ? 5 and are available from the church . The event runs from 2pm to 5.30pm .  On Wednesday there is a coffee morning between 10.30am and noon at Mount Barn .  Later that day youngest ever World Poetry Slam Champion Harry Baker brings his Edinburgh Festival sell-out show to the church field at 7pm .  The following afternoon at 3pm there is Tea with Literati before the church fete on Friday and the bake off on Saturday . Baking teams of up to eight people need to register by Wednesday and the entry fee is ? 50 per team .  More events including a birthday party for the Queen and a recital by top classical musician Orlando Jopling are planned for next week .
