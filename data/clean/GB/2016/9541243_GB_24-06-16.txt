<h> 5 Reasons ZZ Top 's Glastonbury Set Was Rock'n'Roll Gold <p> When it comes to rock legends , there are no bigger - or beardier - than ZZ Top . Forming a whopping 47 years ago , the Texan trio are so relaxed about playing to tens of thousands of people on the Pyramid Stage that they 're practically horizontal . Here are the five reasons why their Friday afternoon set proved their status as guitar heroes . <p> The Jewellery ZZ Top love a bit of bling . Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill and weighed down with so much jewellery it 's a wonder that they can actually play their guitars . They 've hefty skull rings on their fingers , chunky silver bangles and necklaces upon necklaces dangling around their throats . And they look good . Sharp in fact . Making their thundering trip through 1983 's ' Sharp Dressed Man ' all the more spot-on . <p> The Tunes ZZ Top are not one of those bands you go to watch to let their brand new experimental direction wash over you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hits they provide . We get ' Gim me All Your Lovin ' , ' La Grange ' , the aforementioned ' Sharp Dressed Man ' , ' Legs ' , ' Tush ' and a whole bunch of other songs containing thinly veiled references to women 's bottoms , as well as 1994 's ' Pincushion ' , which features the immortal lyric " I 'm getting pricked around and punctureated/I let my ya ya down , I got penetrated " .

Half of the time his accent is so thick that it 's nigh on impossible to work out what he 's saying . " Time to drink a little whisskaayyyyy , " he roars before ' Chartreuse ' . Rest assured the rest of the time he 's probably talking about butts . Or booze . Or both . The moment he lights up not a cigarette , but an actual cigar during the finale of ' Tush ' , also warrants a mention . <p> The Bearded Keyboard ZZ Top have beards . We all know this . Well , all aside from their drummer , who in one of the great ironies of rock is called Frank Beard . ZZ Top 's keyboard also has a beard . Wheeled out for a rollicking version of ' La Grange ' , Dusty 's keys are draped in the kind of fluff that high street stores sometimes like to pop in the window when it 's Christmas and pretend it 's snow . In ZZ Top 's case , the fluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
