Recent Articles  Nobody could accuse India 's telecoms regulator , TRAI , of being in the operators ' pockets . This month it has , once again , set eye-watering reserve prices for the upcoming 700 MHz spectrum auction ( see separate item ) , and now it has taken one of the toughest stances in the world on net neutrality , in effect banning zero rated or discounted content deals like Reliance Communications ' Facebook Basics , or Bharti Airtel 's Zero .  In a ruling last Monday , TRAI said telecoms providers are banned from offering discriminatory tariffs for data services based on content , and from entering deals to subsidize access to certain websites . They have six months to wind down any existing arrangements which contravene the new rules . Its stance is even stricter than in other countries with strong pro-neutrality laws , such as Brazil and The Netherlands .  " This is the most extensive and stringent regulation on differential pricing anywhere in the world , " Pranesh Prakash , policy director at the Centre for Internet and place of complete ban have clearly lost . "  Such decisions , combined with high spectrum costs , will quickly make the traditional cellular business model unworkable in India , and the more that happens , the more wireless internet innovation will switch to open networks running on Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum . R.S. Sharma , chairman of TRAI , was careful to tell reporters that the zero rating ruling would not affect any plans to offer free Wi-Fi services , like those planned by Google in a venture with Indian Railways .  A disaster for MNOs , not Facebook  Facebook pronounced itself " disappointed " at TRAI 's ruling , having lobbied aggressively for a more flexible approach since RCOM was forced to suspend the Basics offering in December while the consultation process took place . But while the ruling bars the Basics offering -- which provided free , low speed access , on RCOM 's network , to a selection of websites , curated by Facebook -- it does not stop the social media giant pursuing other initiatives within its internet.org umbrella . These include projects drones and unlicensed spectrum , to the unserved of India and other emerging economies .  So while the TRAI decision may be a setback for Facebook , it is not the body blow that it represents for the MNOs with their huge debt loads and infrastructure costs , and low ARPUs . Facebook , with 130m users in India , has a comparable reach to the Indian MNOs ( only three , Bharti Airtel , Vodafone and Idea , have more subscribers than Facebook has users ) , and is better skilled at monetizing those consumers .  The challenge for companies like Facebook is that strict neutrality rules reduce their ability to harness others ' networks in order to reach out to new users . There are about 240m people in India who are online , but do n't use Facebook , and about 800m who are not connected , so the growth potential is far larger than in the other 37 countries where Basics is offered , such as Kenya or Zambia ( Facebook is blocked in China ) . Using RCOM 's network and marketing activities was than launching drones , but Facebook has other options too , including its existing efforts to make its services more usable on very basic handsets and connections ; the ability to leverage the WhatsApp brand ; and partnerships with Wi-Fi providers .  The drones may have less immediate results than Basics , but they are a high profile example of an ongoing shift towards open networks , which has been going on for years , driven more by Wi-Fi proliferation than neutrality laws . The latter will be an accelerant , however .  All internet will be free , not zero rated  Currently , zero rating is an increasingly popular tactic to lure users with an apparently cheap deal and then , hopefully , see them upgrade to richer data plans , or spend money on m-commerce and premium content , in future . Zero rating involves allowing users access to selected websites and services without it affecting their data caps or allowances .  The US regulator has so far tolerated the practice , but the debate is raging , there and elsewhere , over whether it internet services . If other authorities take the stance adopted by TRAI in India , operators will have to find new ways to attract customers and differentiate themselves .  Increasingly , access to a truly open internet will be the baseline , and priced extremely low . That low pricing will be made commercially viable by rising use of Wi-Fi to reduce cost of data delivery , whether for MNOs , wireline providers or web players like Google and Facebook , which are moving into access provision . Providers , whether traditional or new , will have to stop regarding access to the internet as a premium service or a privilege -- it will be more akin to connecting someone to the electricity grid , just the base enabler of the real revenue model .  Just as it 's only when users plug something into that grid that they start to pay fees , so the operators will charge for higher value offerings which ride on top of the internet -- premium content , enterprise services , cloud storage , freemium applications and so on .  The mobile , the ability to access the internet from a mobile device was regarded as a value-add , almost a miracle . Now that the wireless network is often the primary access method , they need to change their ideas and be more like the smarter cablecos -- which have tacked internet access onto a model driven by paid-for content and services -- or the web giants , which have worked out ways to monetize ' free ' access , from advertising to big data .  This , of course , is one of the goals of internet.org and Google 's similar initiatives involving drones , white space spectrum and satellites . The more users are able to access the internet , preferably for free , and the more they see Google or Facebook as their primary conduits to the web , the more data these companies have to feed into their deep learning platforms , their context aware services and their advertising and big data engines .  So while critics of TRAI said the zero rating decision was a setback to the goal of getting internet access into the population is too large and potentially rich for Facebook and its rivals to give up at the first hurdle .  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post : " While we 're disappointed with today 's decision , I want to personally communicate that we are committed to keep working to break down barriers to connectivity in India and around the world . Internet.org has many initiatives , and we will keep working until everyone has access to the internet. "
