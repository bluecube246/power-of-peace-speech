<h> JK Rowling just released an epic tale about the history of Ilvermorny and American magic <p> With Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them due in cinemas later this year , JK Rowling has just treated us to a data dump of detail about the history of American magic -- or , more specifically , the foundations of Ilvermorny . You know , the American equivalent to Hogwarts where US witches and wizards learn their craft . <p> The information comes in the form of a brand new story released on Pottermore -- but for those of you at work ( or without a spare 15 minutes to plough through all the new facts ) , we 've taken it upon ourselves to break down some essential details for you . <p> Here goes ... <p> 1 . Ilvermorny was founded in the 17th century by Isolt Sayre , a young woman from Ireland whose parents were murdered ( so far , so Harry Potter ) by her mother 's estranged sister Gormlaith Gaunt ( yes , Gaunt . Y'know the ancestors of Tom Riddle AKA Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salazar Slytherin and , suffice to say , a whole lot worse than Petunia Dursley . <p> 2 . After being kidnapped by Gormaith and kept isolated for years , Isolt eventually escaped , stealing her aunt 's wand and making for America aboard a ship . Once there she acquired some companions -- two young boy wizards , a No-Maj ( that 's American for Muggle ) man called James and a creature known as a Pukwudgie , described by Rowling as " a short , grey-faced , large-eared creature distantly related to the European goblin . " He does n't stick around two long but plays a crucial role in the protection of Ilvermorny later on . <p> 3 . Yes , Ilvermorny -- the American version of Hogwarts . Together the foursome founded it , first as a stone cottage which grew over the years to become a magnificent castle . Isolt married James and together they raised and taught the boys -- Webster and Chadwick -- witchcraft and wizardry . They also had two little girls , Martha and Rionach , but the family 's happiness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gormlaith just happened to be a skilled tracker and , with Ilvermorny still in its fledgling stages , she caught wind of her niece 's new venture and set out to destroy it . The odds were stacked in her favour -- she had powerful magic , the element of surprise , and the fact that Isolt 's stolen wand responded to her command . But ... <p> 5 . She did n't bargain on the young wizards -- Webster and Chadwick -- hellbent on protecting their home . It 's no spoiler than Ilvermorny lived on to welcome generations of witches and wizards through its doors , although we 're not going to spoil exactly how it survived -- JK Rowling can tell that story far better than us . <p> 6 . A few centuries have since passed but Isolt , James , Chadwick and Webster 's presence lives on at Ilvermorny . Each named one of the school 's four houses : the Horned Serpent ( chosen by Isolt ) , the panther Wampus ( Webster ) , the Thunderbird ( Chadwick ) and the Pukwudgie ( James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's entrance hall and , come the sorting ceremony , each pupil stands between the four enchanted beasts waiting for them to indicate their desire to have them in their house . ( Fancy being sorted ? Ilvermorny now has its own sorting quiz ! ) <p> 7 . The school 's robes are blue and cranberry , honouring the Ilvermorny 's first joint headmistress and headmaster , Isolt and James -- " blue because it was Isolt 's favourite colour and because she had wished to be in Ravenclaw house as a child ; cranberry in honour of James 's love of cranberry pie . " <p> 8 . William the Pukwudgie became the school 's private security/maintenance service and to this day Ilvermorny still counts a number of Pukwudgies among its staff , including one elderly creature named William . He laughs at the suggestion he once knew Isolt and James but no one knows for sure how long Pukwudgies live ... <p> We use cookies to improve your experience of our website .
