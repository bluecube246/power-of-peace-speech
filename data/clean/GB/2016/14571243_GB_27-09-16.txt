<p> Louise Wright , aged 29 , was killed when she was dragged under the wheels of a Greene King delivery lorry driven by Adam Haywood , aged 31 , on Lower Parliament Street on 3 July 2014 , reports the Derby Telegraph . <p> Haywood , who pleaded not guilty , insisted he had checked his mirrors but could not recall having seen the cyclist nor whether he had indicated as he waited for the traffic lights to change , although he told the trial at Derby Crown Court that " there is no reason " he would not have done so . <p> Speaking about the collision , he said : " When I first turned it did n't feel right and I thought it might have fallen out of gear -- I felt a bit of a shunt . <p> " I checked my gearbox and realised it was n't that , so I thought I could have clipped the traffic light or the kerb or another car from the back end if it had kicked out . <p> " I heard some car horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors and saw her under the back wheels . <p> " I jumped out of the cab and ran around to the back . I saw her and ran to get the phone and called an ambulance . I did n't know what else to do . " <p> After Haywood was convicted by a majority verdict , Judge Jonathan Bennett handed him an eight-month prison sentence suspended for two years , and banned him from driving for two years . <p> He also ordered Haywood to pay ? 1,500 costs and to perform 150 hours of unpaid work . <p> The judge said : " You are going to live with this for years to come and others will live with it for even longer than that . <p> " You did not , that day , I accept , expect this to happen , you set off to do a day 's work , you were doing what you enjoyed doing , but you were careless that day . " <p> Following the trial , Miss Wright 's mother , Sharon Brown , said : " I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the driver sent to prison . When something as tragic as this happens , there are no winners . " <p> Earlier , in a victim impact statement read out to the court , she described how her daughter had told her she was planning a family , and told the court she is " heartbroken " that will never happen . <p> Miss Wright 's partner James Faulkner told the court that the couple had been together since they were both aged 14 . <p> " I have lost everything , my life has been completely reset and I have no idea how to start again without Louise , " he said . <p> " She was unique , she was so very special . She was always there to support me physically and emotionally and now I go home to an empty house every night . <p> Born in Scotland , Simon moved to London aged seven and now lives in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds with his miniature schnauzer , Elodie . He fell in love with cycling one Saturday morning in 1994 while living in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily cycle commuter in London back before riding to work started to boom , he 's been news editor at road.cc since 2009 . Handily for work , he speaks French and Italian . He does n't get to ride his Colnago as often as he 'd like , and freely admits he 's much more adept at cooking than fettling with bikes . <p> You know what , I do n't care that he did n't go to prison . Did he go out that morning intending to kill someone ? Of course not , he 's not a psychopath , he 's just an idiot who made a mistake . Putting him in prison just means that we all pay for his stupidity through our taxes . So let him walk " free " , but the penalty should hurt . What if 25% of his earnings for the next N years went to the family and friends of the deceased and to road safety education ? <p> You know what , I do n't care that he did n't go to prison .

Probably not . Except that we 'd have to feed him , I 'd hope he never works again.Certainly not driving anything . <p> Agree prison should be for where there was intent . An accident through negligence should cost time and money to the defendant . Outside of prison they can earn to pay that . <p> If they cause death by accident they should be banned from driving for life . Taxi 's and busses will benefit , and no other road user will ever suffer from their ignorance . They should also be taxed to support victim support , for the rest of their working life . <p> You should n't have an HGV license after the ban . Start back at the beginning with a provisional . Practice . Do another car test . When you have demonstrated you can do that to a competent standard start thinking about other tests . <p> To be fair , from the report , he sounds much more remorsefull than we usually hear . Stayed at the sceen , called ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the best way to deal with this situation . <p> To be fair , from the report , he sounds much more remorsefull than we usually hear . Stayed at the sceen , called ambulance , admitted guilt in court ... Frankly , prision probbly is n't the best way to deal with this situation . <p> However the driving ban should be longer . <p> And if you break a driving ban - then it should be stright to prison . <p> remorsefull , lol , read again , he pleaded NOT guilty <p> I would n't be surprised to hear that he appeals the driving ban as a cruel and unsusal punishment . <p> You should n't have an HGV license after the ban . Start back at the beginning with a provisional . Practice . Do another car test . When you have demonstrated you can do that to a competent standard start thinking about other tests . <p> I think bans are more appropriate , particularly if it involves a large vehicle , taxi or bus . Allow them to retest for normal cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaking HGV license , or taxi license etc . Also , any collision involving serious injury or death should be reported to insurance for 10 years instead of 5 . <p> you can class it as victim blaming but I seriously think as a cyclist you should anticipate and expect the worst , particularly when a vehicle emerges from a junction or ther is a left turn opportunity . <p> Take the moral high ground if you want but your family wont thank you when they 're stood over your grave . <p> If you treat every motorist as a fcking retard and assume at all times they have n't seen you , you will be far safer . The amount of times I have avoided collisions ( funnily enough I avoided one today ) by assuming every car driver has nt seen me and is going to do the unthinkable is untrue . <p> Sound advice , that I wholly agree with . Although this is one of those classic left hooks with the added danger of no mirror checks or indication . It 's a bit like the DfT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet fa to do with the way you are riding , and everything to do with how the deathtrap about to randomly turn into you is operated . <p> So you are right , victim blaming indeed . <p> The real issue is the judicial " you did n't mean to " punishment . His driving fell far below any standards , and he should be without a license for alot longer , with checks on his driving carried out at all levels after his ban . It 's actually logical because he wo n't have been driving for quite a while during his ban , his standards may have slipped further .
