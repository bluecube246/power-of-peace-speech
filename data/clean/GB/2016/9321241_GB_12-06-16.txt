former senator bob graham , who headed the senate intelligence committee that compiled the classified report in 2002 , has said that saudi officials did provide assistance to the 9/11 hijackers .  but mr brennan said this was not the case .  " so these 28 pages i believe are going to come out and i think it 's good that they come out . people should n't take them as evidence of saudi complicity in the attacks , " mr brennan said in an interview with saudi-owned arabiya tv .  mr brennan also described the 28-page section of the 2002 report as merely a " preliminary review " .  " the 9/11 commission looked very thoroughly at these allegations of saudi involvement ... their conclusion was that there was no evidence to indicate that the saudi government as an institution or senior saudi officials individually had supported the 9/11 attacks , " he said .  in may , a bill to allow americans to sue saudi arabia over the attacks , in which nearly 3,000 people died , was passed by .  saudi arabia 's foreign minister has warned that the move could cause his government to withdraw us investments .  mr graham has said that the white house would decide whether to release the classified pages this month .
