<h> Tea is one of our greatest pleasures - it needs no innovation <p> " Let 's have a cup of tea " is the " once upon a time ... " of adult British lifeCredit : Dominic Lipinski/PA <p> As a nation , we drink 165 million cups of tea a day . We use it to hydrate our happiest and saddest times , fuel us through work and enable us in procrastination , ease broken hearts and hangovers , forge new friendships and cement old ones . <p> " Let 's have a cup of tea " is the " Once upon a time ... " of adult British life , a phrase that is at once soothing and full of promise . We take tea very seriously indeed . <p> We are promised " satisfying new tea formats " enriched with vitamins and designed to cure everything from hangovers to hair loss . The new tea totalitarians forecast we will be taking our daily cuppa in the form of jelly , tablets , and even spray . <p> Let me read the leaves here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The essential appeal of tea is the life-affirming , faffing-about ritual of making it <p> In the 1970s , scientists promised us food would be replaced by pills . Manufacturers went big on conveyor-belt convenience stuff served on airline-style trays . <p> None of the washing up , but none of the pleasure either - or by now we 'd all be eating Smash , instead of craving proper mash whipped full of butter as soon as the thermometer dips below 25 ? C. <p> As a nation , we drink 165 million cups of tea a dayCredit : -/Alamy <p> The essential appeal of tea is the life-affirming , faffing-about ritual of making it . It provides an excuse to get up from our desks , avoid awkward moments or flee difficult ones , or to do something thoughtful when saying the right thoughtful thing is beyond us . <p> Whether your ritual involves swirling hot water in granny 's favourite tea pot to warm it before adding special order lapsang leaves , or dunking a bag in your special mug , it 's highly unlikely that a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . <p> How to make the perfect cup of tea Play ! 01:35 <p> As for the drink itself : just as those who queue daily for syruped-up cups of **28;1273;TOOLONG do n't , in their hearts , really like coffee , so these " teas " are aimed at those who do n't really care for -- and probably do n't deserve -- a proper cuppa . <p> Perhaps the new model of tea will catch on , in smart " wellness " emporia , where intense young men and women hand over money they probably should have spent on therapy for blister packs of antioxidant oolong . Personally , I think the tea bag was quite innovation enough . <p> I received a press release recently for green teas in strawberry cupcake and lemon pie flavours , presumably for those who are keen on the astringent , cleansing properties of green tea but would rather eat cake . I wo n't shame the manufacturer here , but would encourage them to go back to the blending room and think about what they 've done . <p> Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Suddenly he realized what it was . ' Is there any tea on this spaceship ? ' he asked.Douglas Adams , The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy <p> The truth is , teas of all kinds - black , white , green and oolong - are rich in antioxidants just as they are . If you 're keen on a change , I advise stripping away rather than adding on . <p> Infusions , or tisanes if we 're being smart , are an excellent choice partly because they combine two of the great British pastimes : gardening and thrift . <p> Simply pinch off a few leaves of verbena , lemon balm or mint as you waft around the garden ( yours or someone else 's , they 'll hardly notice ) , bung them into a cup , pour over boiling water and you 're done : reviving , refreshing , and guaranteed to reach the parts other flavour formats can not reach .
