<h> Brazilian-Arab fusion fashion transforms the abaya <p> Dancer-turned-designer , Martina Cancio , has recently swapped the dance floor for the sketchbook after being influenced by the style of both the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) and the Brazilian state of Bahia , her hometown . <p> A fascination with the two different styles led Cancio to create a fusion of them both -- an abayana . The abayana blends the traditional middle eastern abaya and the vibrant style and colours from Brazil . <p> " Abayana is an open abaya that differs from the traditional ones , which are black and front-closed . The colours came from the Senhor do Bonfim wrist ribbons , which come in all colours but black " , explains the dancer and now fashion designer . <p> Cancio claims that her revolutionary idea came from wanting to please women from all nationalities . <p> " The women like them . I want to design something joyful to please non-Muslim foreigners but like the elegance of the abaya , and also to please the Arab women , who use the black abaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private parties , and the young women that already use the more open black abaya " , she says . <p> There are currently three different styles being sold , with more in the process of design and manufacture . <p> Cancio 's designs are sold in UAE for the retail price of approximately ? 100.
