brazilian-arab fusion fashion transforms the abaya  dancer-turned-designer , martina cancio , has recently swapped the dance floor for the sketchbook after being influenced by the style of both the united arab emirates ( uae ) and the brazilian state of bahia , her hometown .  a fascination with the two different styles led cancio to create a fusion of them both -- an abayana . the abayana blends the traditional middle eastern abaya and the vibrant style and colours from brazil .  " abayana is an open abaya that differs from the traditional ones , which are black and front-closed . the colours came from the senhor do bonfim wrist ribbons , which come in all colours but black " , explains the dancer and now fashion designer .  cancio claims that her revolutionary idea came from wanting to please women from all nationalities .  " the women like them . i want to design something joyful to please non-muslim foreigners but like the elegance of the abaya , and also to please the arab women , who use the black abaya private parties , and the young women that already use the more open black abaya " , she says .  there are currently three different styles being sold , with more in the process of design and manufacture .  cancio 's designs are sold in uae for the retail price of approximately ? 100.
