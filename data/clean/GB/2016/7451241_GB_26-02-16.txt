<h> US election 2016 : Day one of the Republican civil war <p> Well , that 's it then . The Republican Party has come unglued . It 's been a long time in the making , but the day of reckoning is finally here . <p> For decades there 's been an uneasy alliance between the various factions within the Republican Party . The business interests have joined with social conservatives and economic populists to form a governing coalition . <p> At least it was a governing coalition before Barack Obama won two straight presidential races and fashioned an electorate made up of the young , minorities and women that has significantly tilted the playing field toward Democrats for the foreseeable future . <p> While thanks to population distribution and electoral district map-making Republicans seem secure in their hold on the US Congress , Mr Obama has proven that the power of the presidency matters most . Presented with this frustration , the Republican Party is tearing itself asunder . <p> Donald Trump is leading a movement of populists and some disaffected evangelicals against the reigning establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . What once seemed to be an impossible feat could , with sweeping wins in primary contests over the next two weeks , become a new , very different reality . <p> All this was laid bare in a series of remarkable events over the last 24 hours . <p> Image copyrightGetty Images <h> Republican debate - shots fired <p> The big question going into Thursday night 's Republican debate in Houston was whether , with their backs to the wall , Mr Trump 's two main challengers would launch a full-scale assault on the frontrunner . <p> Within the first few minutes it became clear that they would . Marco Rubio tore into the New Yorker 's business record . Ted Cruz questioned his conservative credentials . Both mocked his lack of policy details . The blows came fast and hard . <p> This was not the first time a presidential competitor had gone after Mr Trump of course . But up until now the attacks had always come from the desperate margins . <p> In July former Texas Governor Rick Perry called Mr Trump a " cancer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . <p> Then Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal went after the New Yorker , labelling him a narcissist and an egomaniac who was " full of foolishness and nonsense " . He suspended his campaign in November . <p> Jeb Bush was the next to make an attack run , tweeting earlier this month that the billionaire was a liar , a loser and a whiner . Last Saturday Mr Bush 's presidential quest ended . <p> Now the fusillade against Trump is coming from the men standing next to him on the debate stage . There are no desperate margins anymore . The desperation has reached all the way to the top . <p> Media captionTrump mocks Rubio 's water cravings <h> A new kind of war <p> As he has when confronted with attacks in the past , Mr Trump launched a storm the following day against his aggressors . <p> He tweeted that Mr Rubio was a lightweight and Mr Cruz was a liar . He said the Floridian " looks like a little boy on the stage " and the Texan is a " nasty guy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that Mr Rubio was a " nervous basket case " who " was putting on makeup with a trowel " . <p> The difference this time , though , is that Mr Rubio is responding in kind . Gone is the noble , high-spirited talk of his humble beginnings and desire to launch a " new American century " . Instead Mr Rubio 's rallies on Friday seemed more like a late-night stand-up comedy act . <p> Mr Rubio read Mr Trump 's tweets and mocked his typos . <p> " Is that how they spell ' choker ' at the Wharton School of Business ? " he quipped . He called Mr Trump a " con man " who " spent a career in business sticking it to the little guys . " <p> He even said that Mr Trump was powdering his " sweat moustache " during breaks at the debate and had requested a full-length mirror , maybe " to check if his pants were wet " . <p> For months Mr Trump has been operating on a different rhetorical level than his presidential opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds that he thinks the whole US political process is a reality-TV joke - and he , for one , is going to let them in on it . <p> Meanwhile serious politicians gave serious speeches , and Mr Trump ate them alive , one by one . <p> On Friday Mr Rubio decided to play the game by Mr Trump 's rules . At this point , however , the New Yorker may have an insurmountable head start . <p> Image copyrightGetty Images <h> The Christie dilemma <p> The biggest bombshell of the past 24 hours came when Mr Trump took the stage in Dallas on Friday morning , flanked by former Republican adversary Chris Christie . <p> The New Jersey governor 's endorsement marks a turning point in the Republican nomination fight . Up until now Mr Rubio has dominated the establishment endorsement battle . Mr Trump 's allies were a collection of political has-beens and fringe personalities . <p> Mr Christie , however , is as establishment as they come . He 's the former head of the powerful Republican Governors Association . He was the keynote speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's impossible to characterise Mr Trump as a hostile outside force anymore . Mr Trump 's scary political phone calls are coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE . <p> If they all stick together , there 's a chance they could prevent Mr Trump from winning the nomination . But the benefits of breaking from the pack and supporting the New Yorker now may be too tempting to resist . <p> By being one of the first to endorse Mr Christie grabs a front seat in Mr Trump 's new Republican order . Expect others to follow , as Maine Governor Paul LePage did later on Friday . <h> And now what ? <p> So is this the beginning or the end ? Will Mr Trump and his new band of supporters take over the Republican Party ? <p> The next few weeks will tell us a great deal , as his competitors - Mr Cruz , Mr Rubio and Ohio Governor John Kasich - all face tough tests in primaries in their home states . <p> If any of them lose they will likely be knocked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nomination . <p> Then it 's a question of whether the party will fall in line behind their new leader or fight a rearguard battle to the last man . <p> Some Republicans do n't appear eager to go gently into the night . <p> " My party has gone crazy , " South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham , himself a former Republican presidential hopeful , said at a congressional dinner Thursday night , punctuating the line with an expletive . <p> On Friday Rubio fashioned it as a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party . <p> " The Republican Party would be split apart if he became the nominee , " Rubio said . " We can not allow the party of Reagan to be taken over by a con man . " <p> A civil war is brewing within the Republican ranks - and the bloodshed has only just begun .
