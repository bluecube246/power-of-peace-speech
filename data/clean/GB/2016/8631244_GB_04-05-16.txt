<h> Didcot Gateway scheme a " mess " as councillors raise concern about lack of progress <p> COUNCILLORS say they are furious about the lack of progress over the ? 60m redevelopment of Didcot 's " gateway " and fear the site will deteriorate further unless action is taken . <p> The scheme planned for land opposite Didcot Parkway station , which includes a hotel , 300 homes , a decked car park for the train station and a nursery , was granted outline planning application this year . <p> But two months on South Oxfordshire District Council ( SODC ) , which owns the land , has yet to confirm a developer for the scheme or a company to run the eight-storey hotel . <p> Town and district councillor Margaret Davies said she was very concerned about the scheme 's lack of progress . <p> She said : " It is not turning out the way anybody would want it to - this is a lose-lose scheme at present . <p> " If nobody is coming forward to spruce it up I am very concerned that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " They have granted outline planning permission and now they are waiting for a developer -- one would have thought these conversations would have been taking place for quite some time . " <p> Mrs Davies warned that having the deteriorating site opposite the main entrance to the town was not good for Didcot 's image . <p> She said : " To have this mess immediately outside the railway station is not the best introduction to the town . <p> " I am really concerned that if they have not got to a better stage , having not identified a developer to take it forward , this will just collapse . " <p> The future of the Prince of Wales pub next to the site also hangs in the balance after it was not included in the redevelopment plans . <p> A Greene King spokesman said : " This planning application was submitted without any formal agreement between ourselves and the council . <p> " The Prince of Wales is a popular and well-loved pub in the community and a landmark historic building . We do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business . " <p> Deputy town council leader Bill Service said he was concerned that if the district council did not find a hotel company to take on the plans , there would be high-rise accommodation instead . <p> He said : " We have had nothing come from South Oxfordshire District Council . <p> " The last I heard they could not get a hotel company to take up the challenge . <p> " It is my own personal view that if they can not get a hotel company to come in then I think they will put high-rise accommodation on there . <p> " If you look at all the other buildings in the town , there is nothing higher than four storeys . " <p> Dissatisfied residents in the town have already formed campaign group Gateway Aware to change details on the application which they feel would overshadow their homes . <p> South Oxfordshire District Council leader John Cotton , said : " It is going to be a while before we have anything . <p> " There is a lot of stuff going on at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a number of important schemes . <p> " Nothing is going to happen in the next couple of weeks but in the summer we will have some more detail then . " <h> Promoted stories <h> Comments <p> Usual SODC mess . The Town Council should have been fully involved and their view considered as part of any major redevelopment . What a shambles . But then what do you expect form a District Council that does not even bother to talk to the Town Council before submitting an application for Didcot to be a Garden City ! <p> The sooner SODC is abolished and things like this are coordinated at a County level with the Town/Parish councils the better . SODC are just an unnecessary costly layer of local government we do not need . <p> Usual SODC mess .
