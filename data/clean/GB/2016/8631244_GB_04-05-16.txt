didcot gateway scheme a " mess " as councillors raise concern about lack of progress  councillors say they are furious about the lack of progress over the ? 60m redevelopment of didcot 's " gateway " and fear the site will deteriorate further unless action is taken .  the scheme planned for land opposite didcot parkway station , which includes a hotel , 300 homes , a decked car park for the train station and a nursery , was granted outline planning application this year .  but two months on south oxfordshire district council ( sodc ) , which owns the land , has yet to confirm a developer for the scheme or a company to run the eight-storey hotel .  town and district councillor margaret davies said she was very concerned about the scheme 's lack of progress .  she said : " it is not turning out the way anybody would want it to - this is a lose-lose scheme at present .  " if nobody is coming forward to spruce it up i am very concerned that this .  " they have granted outline planning permission and now they are waiting for a developer -- one would have thought these conversations would have been taking place for quite some time . "  mrs davies warned that having the deteriorating site opposite the main entrance to the town was not good for didcot 's image .  she said : " to have this mess immediately outside the railway station is not the best introduction to the town .  " i am really concerned that if they have not got to a better stage , having not identified a developer to take it forward , this will just collapse . "  the future of the prince of wales pub next to the site also hangs in the balance after it was not included in the redevelopment plans .  a greene king spokesman said : " this planning application was submitted without any formal agreement between ourselves and the council .  " the prince of wales is a popular and well-loved pub in the community and a landmark historic building . we do not wish the business . "  deputy town council leader bill service said he was concerned that if the district council did not find a hotel company to take on the plans , there would be high-rise accommodation instead .  he said : " we have had nothing come from south oxfordshire district council .  " the last i heard they could not get a hotel company to take up the challenge .  " it is my own personal view that if they can not get a hotel company to come in then i think they will put high-rise accommodation on there .  " if you look at all the other buildings in the town , there is nothing higher than four storeys . "  dissatisfied residents in the town have already formed campaign group gateway aware to change details on the application which they feel would overshadow their homes .  south oxfordshire district council leader john cotton , said : " it is going to be a while before we have anything .  " there is a lot of stuff going on at the one of a number of important schemes .  " nothing is going to happen in the next couple of weeks but in the summer we will have some more detail then .
