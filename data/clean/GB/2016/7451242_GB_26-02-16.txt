More than 60 per cent of gay and bisexual men diagnosed with HIV reported meeting sexual partners online , according to a new study .  The finding has prompted calls for hookup apps and dating websites to include warnings about sexually transmitted diseases .  Scientists recommend such apps partner with public health groups to share messages about the risks of sexual encounters arranged online .  Study co-author Dr Nicole Alexander-Scott , director of the Rhode Island Department of Health , said : ' A study like this is an urgent call to action for greater collaboration around education to address the health needs of men who have sex with men .  ' The rate of new HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men represents an unacceptable health disparity that absolutely must be addressed . '  More than 60 per cent of gay and bisexual men who were diagnosed with HIV in 2013 in Rhode Island claim they contracted the disease from someone they met on a dating app , according to a new study . And so , scientists argue was conducted by scientists from Brown University , The Miriam Hospital and the Rhode Island Department of Health .  The study focused on residents of Rhode Island .  There were 74 new HIV diagnoses in the state in 2013 , according to the study .  Share this article  And of those 43 people , 22 told the scientists that they believe they were infected by a man they met online .  Five dating sites and apps -- some of which are also used by women -- were cited as the most popular by the infected men : Grindr , Manhunt , Scruff , Adam4Adam and Craigslist .  The scientists interviewed 70 of the 74 newly diagnosed people for the study .  Dr Amy Nunn , an associate professor at Brown and director of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute , said : ' This is a statewide study that included nearly all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV across the entire state .  ' This is one of the first studies to document how common internet use is among people newly diagnosed with HIV advance public health . '  Lead study author Dr Philip Chan , an assistant professor of medicine at Brown and director at the STD Clinic at The Miriam Hospital , noted that widely used sites are common in the gay and bisexual culture .  Those apps and sites can lead to lasting relationships -- not just health risks .  There were 43 new HIV cases from men who have sex with men ( MSM ) in Rhode Island in 2013 , the study revealed . Of that group , 22 said they were infected by someone they met online  And so , the goal of the study is not to stigmatize men who use those sites .  Instead , Dr Chan and Dr Nunn added , the goal is to inspire partnerships with companies to include more information to slow the spread of HIV .  Dr Chan said : ' Across the US , we are seeing men who have sex with men as the number one risk group for HIV infection .  ' On these online hookup sites , many young men who ' It 's really an under recognized and under-utilized approach we should be using to reach out to and engage this group . '  The five most popular dating apps cited by the HIV-infected men in the study include Grindr , Manhunt , Scruff , Adam4Adam and Craigslist  Thus far , public health officials have struggled to get information on such sites and apps that charge for advertising .  That 's because they have no discounts for non-profits or do n't discount enough .  Craigslist and Scruff ads are free , however , but staff at small non-profit or government agencies struggle to continually repost ads .  Dr Nunn said : ' One of the challenges this study highlights is that it 's prohibitively expensive for many organizations who focus on public health promotion to buy ads on these apps and websites .  ' Reducing disease transmission should be part of these organizations ' corporate social responsibility programs . '  The study noted that advertising can cost thousands of dollars .  Dr Chan said : ' We would like to see more of public health departments . '  The study added that in 2014 , HIV infections in Rhode Island grew by 97 new diagnoses .  The scientists gave sites including Adam4Adam and Manhunt credit for recently allowing their users to list their HIV status in their profile .  And , those sites , as well as Scruff , allow users to list whether they are taking the HIV preventative daily regimen pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) .
