<p> More than 60 per cent of gay and bisexual men diagnosed with HIV reported meeting sexual partners online , according to a new study . <p> The finding has prompted calls for hookup apps and dating websites to include warnings about sexually transmitted diseases . <p> Scientists recommend such apps partner with public health groups to share messages about the risks of sexual encounters arranged online . <p> Study co-author Dr Nicole Alexander-Scott , director of the Rhode Island Department of Health , said : ' A study like this is an urgent call to action for greater collaboration around education to address the health needs of men who have sex with men . <p> ' The rate of new HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men represents an unacceptable health disparity that absolutely must be addressed . ' <p> More than 60 per cent of gay and bisexual men who were diagnosed with HIV in 2013 in Rhode Island claim they contracted the disease from someone they met on a dating app , according to a new study . And so , scientists argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted by scientists from Brown University , The Miriam Hospital and the Rhode Island Department of Health . <p> The study focused on residents of Rhode Island . <p> There were 74 new HIV diagnoses in the state in 2013 , according to the study . <h> Share this article <p> And of those 43 people , 22 told the scientists that they believe they were infected by a man they met online . <p> Five dating sites and apps -- some of which are also used by women -- were cited as the most popular by the infected men : Grindr , Manhunt , Scruff , Adam4Adam and Craigslist . <p> The scientists interviewed 70 of the 74 newly diagnosed people for the study . <p> Dr Amy Nunn , an associate professor at Brown and director of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute , said : ' This is a statewide study that included nearly all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV across the entire state . <p> ' This is one of the first studies to document how common internet use is among people newly diagnosed with HIV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance public health . ' <p> Lead study author Dr Philip Chan , an assistant professor of medicine at Brown and director at the STD Clinic at The Miriam Hospital , noted that widely used sites are common in the gay and bisexual culture . <p> Those apps and sites can lead to lasting relationships -- not just health risks . <p> There were 43 new HIV cases from men who have sex with men ( MSM ) in Rhode Island in 2013 , the study revealed . Of that group , 22 said they were infected by someone they met online <p> And so , the goal of the study is not to stigmatize men who use those sites . <p> Instead , Dr Chan and Dr Nunn added , the goal is to inspire partnerships with companies to include more information to slow the spread of HIV . <p> Dr Chan said : ' Across the US , we are seeing men who have sex with men as the number one risk group for HIV infection . <p> ' On these online hookup sites , many young men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It 's really an under recognized and under-utilized approach we should be using to reach out to and engage this group . ' <p> The five most popular dating apps cited by the HIV-infected men in the study include Grindr , Manhunt , Scruff , Adam4Adam and Craigslist <p> Thus far , public health officials have struggled to get information on such sites and apps that charge for advertising . <p> That 's because they have no discounts for non-profits or do n't discount enough . <p> Craigslist and Scruff ads are free , however , but staff at small non-profit or government agencies struggle to continually repost ads . <p> Dr Nunn said : ' One of the challenges this study highlights is that it 's prohibitively expensive for many organizations who focus on public health promotion to buy ads on these apps and websites . <p> ' Reducing disease transmission should be part of these organizations ' corporate social responsibility programs . ' <p> The study noted that advertising can cost thousands of dollars . <p> Dr Chan said : ' We would like to see more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health departments . ' <p> The study added that in 2014 , HIV infections in Rhode Island grew by 97 new diagnoses . <p> The scientists gave sites including Adam4Adam and Manhunt credit for recently allowing their users to list their HIV status in their profile . <p> And , those sites , as well as Scruff , allow users to list whether they are taking the HIV preventative daily regimen pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) .
