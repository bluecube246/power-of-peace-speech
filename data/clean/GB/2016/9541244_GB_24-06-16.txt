<p> Although a number of pro-Brexit campaigners may think the UK is being overrun by asylum seekers - Pat Joyce , team leader of DCRS , admits that it 's a very small number in the grand scheme of things , as well as comparing the UK to the rest of Europe . <p> Pat says : " Many are saying the current refugee crisis is the biggest influx of people fleeing their homes since World War II . <p> " There are roughly 65.3 million refugees and asylum seekers - but most of these people are still in the poorest places from around their home country . <p> " As soon as you label someone they lose their identity and this is something that we need to stop . <p> Plymouth is the second largest dispersal city in the UK , behind Bristol , meaning it is a city that has agreed to house and support asylum seekers waiting for refugee status . <p> Once refugee status is granted the individuals are able to work and support their families - this process can often take months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge turmoil when they arrive in the UK . First they will move between seven different cities before they arrive in a dispersal area . <p> DCRS will then start working with the individual , the majority are male between the ages of 18 and 30 , offering them support to buy food , clothing , access to English lessons and housing . <p> If refugee status is denied , the individual can end up homeless , with no money and very little hope - having to travel back to their country illegally . <p> Last year alone , DCRS recorded more than 9,000 visits . Since the charity was started in 1999 , they have received no local authority or government funding . <p> Working with people from more than 46 countries , DCRS is a real hub of creativity , culture and hope . More than 5,000 interviews were conducted with individuals last year - working out about 29 per day . <p> John Shinner , trustee for DCRS , says : " We had a lot of financial turbulence in 2015 but 2016 has been much calmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of projects for the first time . <p> DCRS work alongside the British Red Cross , who help travel the individuals to Plymouth and support them as soon as they touch base in Plymouth . The charity also works closely with START , Students and Refugees Together , to gain access to housing . <p> Pat says : " In one week we saw 255 service users . When the refugee crisis hit last year , we had more than 100 people get in touch to say they wanted to volunteer . <p> We have been taking asylum seekers from the Home Office for the last 15 years and START have been doing the same . <p> " We have an amazing set up in Plymouth . We have a number of organisations who are all so strong in working together to provide what our service users need . <p> " We are all talking as a city and we want asylum seekers here . " <p> Many of the people coming to Plymouth have left family behind when they have fled from persecution . <p> The Home Office believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months but Pat does n't agree . <p> She says : " The Home Office state it will be decided within six months but we know that is not happening in Plymouth . This can be mentally and physically straining on the individuals . <p> " Many of the people we work with say that DCRS are giving them hope and energy and making them feel special . <p> " Everyone has a right to seek asylum from persecution . They are just ordinary people facing extreme struggles . " <p> When the charity was first started as a small church community group , the majority or people were coming from Iraq but over the years people are fleeing war in Afghanistan , Eritrea and Sudan . <p> Almost 15 per cent of the financial support the charity receives is from individuals who recognise the work DCRS are doing . <p> John believes that although have been huge strains on the charity - they will continue to do all they can for the people fleeing war in hope of a safer future . <p> The volunteer says : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to claim asylum . The new legislations in May have again made things more difficult . <p> " There is a lot of confusion between what a migrant is , refugee and asylum seeker . The percentage of asylum seekers coming into England is so small . "
