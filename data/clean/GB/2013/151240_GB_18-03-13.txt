<p> A 12-year-old in California has written a letter to a Supreme Court justice , urging him to strike down Proposition 8 , the state-wide ban on equal marriage . <p> Daniel Martinez-Leffew , who was adopted along with his sister , by his dads , wrote the letter to Justice John Roberts urging him to strike down Prop 8 , but saying that he understands it is a " tough decision " . <p> The video , introduced by his father Bryan , who says that Daniel heard that Justice Roberts also has two adopted children and decided , of his own accord , to write a letter to him . He says Daniel and his sister thought : " Hey , his family is just like ours " . <p> He says : " We were adopted when I was five , and my sister was about 12 months old . When I was in foster care , I was told that I was considered ' unadoptable ' because of my Goldenhar Syndrome . <p> " That is a genetic disorder that affects the whole left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emilio because some people wanted to adopt him but they were n't willing to adopt me because of my medical conditions . Lucky for me , that 's when my two dads came along . " <p> " I recently found out that you , yourself adopted two kids , a boy and a girl , kind of like me and my sister . Family means a lot of different things to f different people . But some people believe you have to have the same blood to be a family . <p> " You and I both know that family goes deeper than blood . I was lucky to be adopted by two guys I can both call dad . They give me and my sister so much love . <p> " My dads really encouraged me to excel in life . Since I want to be a cook , when I grow up , they are letting me take cooking classes . My parents want me to improve , whether its school work , or my social life . <p> " I know you have a tough decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just as valuable and worthwhile as any other . It 's especially tough for you , because I know you do n't necessarily believe in gay marriage religiously , but lucky for us , you also do n't believe in taking away a right , even from people like us . " <p> " If Prop 8 is allowed to stand , imagine the pain we would feel knowing that we are not considered equal to everyone else . It 's important that all families are protected and valued . "
