Can DirectAccess take over the world?

Review Microsoft believes that DirectAccess is such a critical feature of Windows that we will soon wonder how we lived without this fundamental part of network infrastructure .  Having played with it I think Microsoft is very close to being right , but there are some bugs to work out and misconceptions to dispel .  Internet Protocol version 6 ( IPv6 ) promises rainbows and kittens because every device with an IPv6 address can communicate directly with any other . That is a happy world for application developers .  Many who preach the gospel of end-to-end connectivity have assured me that the world will collapse unless we drastically lower the knowledge required to develop an internet-connected application .  Direct answer  But network and systems administrators are somewhat less keen on having their network attack surface transformed from a single externally addressable system into every system plugged into the network .  For reasons of " you do not pay me enough for this " , administrators prefer defending one device instead of thousands .  Sadly , application developers won the war of securing the future rests on network administrators . And that is why DirectAccess was created .  In its original incarnation DirectAccess mediated communication between a client 's public IPv6 and a company 's IPv6-enabled server fleet . DirectAccess verified that the computer attempting access was domain-joined , patched , authorised for access and so forth . It provided a single point of defence , even in an IPv6 world .  In a future where the right of anyone with a computer to directly address every device on your network ( from your internet-connected light bulb to a hospital 's medical equipment ) is enshrined in nerd law , DirectAccess gives Microsoft-using administrators a fighting chance .  If you can master DirectAccess , then you can take advantage of the benefits end-to-end connectivity can offer while mitigating the risks .  Most of the confusion surrounding DirectAccess stems from the fact that it is no more a single technology than Microsoft Exchange is . What we think of as Exchange is a large collection of highly interdependent applications . These in turn are dependent upon applications that we Information Services ( IIS ) and certificate management .  Firewall extension  DirectAccess is no different . The second misconception we need to deal with is that , despite layers of confusing marketing , DirectAccess access is not a virtual private network ( VPN ) . VPN-like technologies are almost always involved in a DirectAccess configuration , but they are to DirectAccess as IIS is to Exchange ( or DNS to Active Directory ) .  DirectAccess is a first attempt at making an IPv6 firewall that mere mortals can ( supposedly ) comprehend . In essence , the core executable is a connection broker . You connect to it , it verifies you are who you say you are and then lets you access company resources .  Indeed , DirectAccess will not work if you disable Windows Firewall . If you think of DirectAccess as an extension of Windows Firewall ( rather than a VPN technology ) the rest of this overview will make a lot more sense .  In the real world , almost no one has IPv6 for all internal servers , for all the that you might want to have a client connect to your network . It will be decades before this becomes a reality .  This means that any practical DirectAccess deployment relies upon some other technologies . At a minimum it uses Isatap to ensure IPv6 connectivity between all intranet sites and connected clients .  DirectAccess also uses the NAT64 and DNS64 protocol translators to ensure that clients can access IPv4 systems on your network . The Server 2008 R2 version did not include these elements as part of the core offering ; Server 2012 does .  In addition to being made up of several sub technologies , DirectAccess has been merged into the larger Remote Access role within Server 2012 . It is no longer seen as a novel technology and has become merely one more sub-component of RemoteAccess.
