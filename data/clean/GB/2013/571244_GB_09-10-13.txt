Labour has acknowledged that it still has its work cut out to win the argument on welfare , after a party pollster said it faced a " very severe " challenge to overcome a Tory lead on benefit cuts .  A spokesman agreed that the party would have to work hard to sell to voters its plans for a social security cap , after the leak of a recording of a briefing by James Morris , from Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research . Reflecting a belief that the Tories are scoring better with the public on the welfare issue , Morris is quoted as saying : " The challenge is very severe ... if you look at politically salient target groups those numbers get worse . "  Morris told a meeting at the Trades Union Congress last Friday that a poll of 3,000 voters had found that 53% of those questioned supported changes to the benefits system . Just over a quarter ( 27% ) opposed the changes .  The poll also found that the only groups of voters who opposed the government 's changes party was not well placed to win over floating voters on the issues . Opponents included Labour voters and people who identified with the party , as well as Guardian and Mirror readers .  Morris told the meeting at the TUC , which commissioned the poll , that support for the government 's reforms increased among voters that would be targeted by the Tories and Liberal Democrats . More than three quarters ( 77% ) of Conservative/Lib Dem voters supported the reforms . Nearly two thirds ( 64% ) of Labour/Conservative swing voters supported the government .  Priti Patel , the Tory MP for Witham , said : " Labour 's rocketing welfare bill is what got us into this mess in the first place . Ed Miliband is the same old Labour ; he has opposed every one of the ? 83bn of welfare savings so far , and he still wants unlimited benefit handouts . It 's taxpayers who would pay the price for this , through higher taxes and higher bills . "  A Labour spokesman said : " We always have more to do people recognise our spending cap on social security spending will tackle the underlying causes of rising social security bills . "  The party announced in the summer that it would cap the structural elements of social spending , on areas such as long-term worklessness and on housing costs . The cap is designed to target the long-term pressures on welfare spending .  However , the polling for the TUC did produce some encouraging figures for Labour in other areas . It found that 77% of those questioned said poor children should always be supported , regardless of the behaviour of their parents .  The polling was carried out just before the Labour conference , at which Miliband unveiled his new slogan : Britain can do better than this . The New Statesman quotes the former Labour leader Lord Kinnock as saying that Miliband said he had inspired the slogan .
