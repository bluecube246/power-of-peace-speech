<h> Sumatra coastal cave records stunning tsunami history <p> Image caption The cave retains the deposits washed ashore by huge waves over thousands of years <p> A cave on the northwestern coast of Sumatra holds a remarkable record of big tsunamis in the Indian Ocean . <p> The limestone opening , close to Banda Aceh , retains the sandy deposits washed ashore by huge , earthquake-induced waves over thousands of years . <p> Scientists are using the site to help determine the frequency of catastrophes like the event of 26 December 2004 . <p> This is being done by dating the cave 's tsunami-borne sediments , which are easy to see between layers of bat droppings . <p> Because people thought they had no history of such things , they thought it was impossibleProf Kerry Sieh , Director , Earth Observatory of Singapore <p> " The tsunami sands just jump right out at you because they 're separated by guano layers . There 's no confusing the stratigraphy ( layering ) , " explains Dr Jessica Pilarczyk . <p> " It makes for interesting field work ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get very excited when people are disrupting their space . But from a geologist 's point of view , this cave has the most amazing stratigraphy , " she told BBC News . <p> She is part of a team of researchers - led by Prof Charles Rubin - from the Earth Observatory of Singapore , an institute of Nanyang Technological University that is investigating the coastal history of Indonesia 's largest island . <p> Image caption The tsunami record from about 7,500 to 3,000 years ago is impeccable , say the scientists <p> Sumatra 's proximity to the Indo-Australia and Sunda tectonic plate boundary , and the giant earthquakes that occur there , means its shores are at risk of major inundations . <p> Understanding how often these occur is important for policy and planning in the region . <p> Media captionDr Jessica Pilarczyk : " A complete sequence from about 7,500 years ago up to 3,000 years ago " <p> The Acehnese cave lies about 100m back from the swash zone at current high-tide . Its entrance is also raised somewhat , and this prevents all waters from getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surges . <p> Dr Pilarczyk and colleagues have dug trenches through the alternating bands of bat guano and sand to piece together the cave 's history . <p> The scientists know they are looking at tsunami deposits because they can find debris in the sediments of seafloor organisms such as microscopic foraminifera . Only the most energetic waves could have lifted and carried this material into the cave . <p> The investigations are ongoing but the team thinks it can see deposition from perhaps 7-10 tsunamis . The geometry of the cave means these events would likely have been generated by earthquakes of Magnitude 8 , or more . By way of comparison , the devastation wrought by 26 December 2004 stemmed from a M9.2 tremor . <p> Dating the old deposits is obtained by radiocarbon analysis of organic debris caught up in the bands , such as molluscs and pieces of charcoal from old human-lit fires . <p> Work is under way to date even the insect remains eaten by the bats and now immersed in the guano layers . <p> Image caption Scientists say there had probably been nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave is so full of sand and bat droppings that any new event will essentially overwash and erode the most recent deposits . " The 2004 tsunami completely inundated the cave , " comments Prof Rubin . <p> Nonetheless , the stratigraphy from about 7,500 to 3,000 years ago is impeccable . <p> " What we think we have is actually a near-complete sequence of late-Holocene deposits . This is amazing because usually the records we have are fragmentary at best . This coastal cave is a unique ' depocentre ' , and it 's giving us a remarkable snapshot of several thousands of years , allowing us to figure out every single tsunami that would have taken place during that time , " said Dr Pilarczyk , who is affiliated also to Rutgers University , US . <p> The team 's other investigations along the Acehnese coast are filling in the period from 3,000 years ago to the present . <p> And the take-home message from all this research is that the biggest tsunamis are not evenly spaced through time . Yes , there can be long periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are separated by just a few decades . <p> Co-investigator Prof Kerry Sieh says this is a cautionary story . <p> " 2004 caught everybody by surprise . And why was that ? Because nobody had been looking back to see how often they happen , if they 'd ever happened , " he told BBC News . <p> " In fact , because people thought they had no history of such things , they thought it was impossible . Nobody was prepared , nobody had even given it a second thought . So the reason we look back in time is so we can learn how the Earth works and how it might work during our watch .
