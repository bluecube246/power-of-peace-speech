richard o'brien : ' i 'm 70% man '  rocky horror show writer richard o'brien thinks of himself as 70% male and 30% female . what exactly does that mean ?  richard o'brien , writer of hit musical the rocky horror show , delighted in shaking up the conservative sexual attitudes of the 1970s .  his most famous creation , dr frank n furter , brought the house down with his song sweet transvestite .  but the show 's creator was ashamed about his own long-held desire to be more feminine .  " i was six-and-a-half and i said to my big brother that i wanted to be the fairy princess when i grew up . the look of disdain on his face made me pull down the shutters . i knew that i should never ever say that out loud again . "  for 50 years , o'brien repressed the feeling . but " you ca n't just put the lid on things and pretend that they do n't exist " , he says .  i believe myself probably so a decade ago , he started taking the female hormone oestrogen - and is happy with the results .  " it takes the edge off the masculine , testosterone-driven side of me and i like that very much . i think i 've become a nicer person in some ways , slightly softer . for the first time in my life , i 've started to put on a little bit of weight , which i like . "  he has also developed small breasts . but o'brien is not intending to go further and have sex reassignment surgery .  " i do n't want to pretend to be something that i 'm not . anton rodgers , the actor , said ' you 're the third sex ' . and i thought that 's quite nice . i quite like that position .  " it 's my belief that we are on a continuum between male and female . there are people who are hardwired male and there are people who are hardwired female , but most of us are on that continuum and i female . "  o'brien 's idea of a gender spectrum may sound far-fetched to many , but there is scientific research that backs up his position . cambridge university psychology professor melissa hines says there are not two distinct sexes , male and female .  there are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they areprof melissa hines  " i think that the research in this field suggests just the opposite . that there is not a gender binary , that there 's a range of gender , and there are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they are on each of these dimensions . "  professor dinesh bhugra , of the institute of psychiatry at king 's college london , offers a different view - suggesting that while people may feel not entirely male , or female , the reality is that they are born one or the other .  " the distinction has to be a social construct , sex is biological .  " my guess would be that social notions of gender dictate how we behave . "  so , how can one explain the feeling experienced by some transgendered people of having been born into the wrong body and wanting to switch sex ?  it has been observed that the brains of male-to-female transsexuals resemble female brains in one region central to sexual behaviour . but it is not clear that this is a cause of transgenderism , rather than an effect .  find out more  listen to the full report on analysis on bbc radio 4 on monday 18 march , 20:30 gmt and sunday , at 21:30 gmt .  hines thinks the male hormone , testosterone , may have a part to play . she has noticed that girls who have been exposed to unusually high levels in the womb tend to prefer stereotypical " boys ' toys " like trucks . and they are more likely than other girls to grow up wanting to live as men .  the uk 's main gender identity referrals last year .  there they are assessed by psychiatrists who will help them adjust to their preferred gender role .  after two years of living as the opposite sex in the uk , you can apply for a gender recognition certificate , which allows you to change your birth certificate .  to qualify , there is no obligation to have changed your body in any way through hormones or surgery . that means you can officially be a woman with a man 's body , or vice versa .  stephen whittle , professor of equalities law at manchester metropolitan university , realised as a 10-year-old that he did n't feel right as a girl .  " it was school races day and there were girls ' races and boys ' races . it was my light on the road to damascus - this sudden realisation that i was always going to be in the wrong race . "  image caption stephen whittle campaigns for transgender rights  at 17 , he started the process of changing sex . surgery has left him with what considers himself straightforwardly a man .  this is typical , says james barrett , lead clinician at the charing cross national gender identity clinic . most of his patients identify as a man or a woman , rather than somewhere in between .  " people who are seeking drastic surgical or hormonal treatment because they wish to live in a socially ambiguous gender role ... are thought about really carefully . the concern is that one does n't want to do anything that 's irreversible and then have them in a position where they 're not happy . "  the problem is , says dr barrett , they have to fit in to a society that that thinks in terms of just two sexes .  " it may well be that biological findings report that , in fact , everybody 's on a spectrum . it 's just that the way society works , most people do n't think of themselves as on any kind of a spectrum at all .  " the same is probably true of sexual orientation . most people do n't describe actually , practically speaking , it very much is . "  some transgender people do not choose to change their bodies completely , however .  this can lead to complicated situations , such as people who choose to live as women - but who have male genitalia - being sent to jail for sexual offences . should they be imprisoned alongside men or women ?  image caption official documents typically ask if the respondent is " male " or " female "  the law is clear that such a woman should go to a women 's prison , says lawyer and former mp , lord carlile . he was the first to raise the issue of transgenderism in parliament in the 1990s .  " if somebody goes into a court and is accused and their original name was ' john smith ' and they choose to call themselves ' jane smith ' they will be tried as ' jane smith ' . i do n't see why what a court recognises should not also be recognised by the prison service .  " awkward though it as challenging and difficult . "  according to whittle , the uk is gradually removing the requirements for people to declare whether they 're a man or a woman . it has already happened with laws as diverse as the sexual offences act and the road traffic act .  he thinks the uk will follow australia and spain in doing away with the need to tick a box on your passport stating if you are male or female .  which box does richard o'brien tick ?  " i tick the m , " he says . " but i would quite like to have other to tick . "  listen to the full report on analysis on bbc radio 4 on monday 18 march , 20:30 gmt and sunday , at 21:30 gmt .
