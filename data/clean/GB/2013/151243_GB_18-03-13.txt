<h> Richard O'Brien : ' I 'm 70% man ' <p> Rocky Horror Show writer Richard O'Brien thinks of himself as 70% male and 30% female . What exactly does that mean ? <p> Richard O'Brien , writer of hit musical The Rocky Horror Show , delighted in shaking up the conservative sexual attitudes of the 1970s . <p> His most famous creation , Dr Frank N Furter , brought the house down with his song Sweet Transvestite . <p> But the show 's creator was ashamed about his own long-held desire to be more feminine . <p> " I was six-and-a-half and I said to my big brother that I wanted to be the fairy princess when I grew up . The look of disdain on his face made me pull down the shutters . I knew that I should never ever say that out loud again . " <p> For 50 years , O'Brien repressed the feeling . But " you ca n't just put the lid on things and pretend that they do n't exist " , he says . <p> I believe myself probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So a decade ago , he started taking the female hormone oestrogen - and is happy with the results . <p> " It takes the edge off the masculine , testosterone-driven side of me and I like that very much . I think I 've become a nicer person in some ways , slightly softer . For the first time in my life , I 've started to put on a little bit of weight , which I like . " <p> He has also developed small breasts . But O'Brien is not intending to go further and have sex reassignment surgery . <p> " I do n't want to pretend to be something that I 'm not . Anton Rodgers , the actor , said ' you 're the third sex ' . And I thought that 's quite nice . I quite like that position . <p> " It 's my belief that we are on a continuum between male and female . There are people who are hardwired male and there are people who are hardwired female , but most of us are on that continuum and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female . " <p> O'Brien 's idea of a gender spectrum may sound far-fetched to many , but there is scientific research that backs up his position . Cambridge University psychology professor Melissa Hines says there are not two distinct sexes , male and female . <p> There are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they areProf Melissa Hines <p> " I think that the research in this field suggests just the opposite . That there is not a gender binary , that there 's a range of gender , and there are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they are on each of these dimensions . " <p> Professor Dinesh Bhugra , of the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London , offers a different view - suggesting that while people may feel not entirely male , or female , the reality is that they are born one or the other . <p> " The distinction has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social construct , sex is biological . <p> " My guess would be that social notions of gender dictate how we behave . " <p> So , how can one explain the feeling experienced by some transgendered people of having been born into the wrong body and wanting to switch sex ? <p> It has been observed that the brains of male-to-female transsexuals resemble female brains in one region central to sexual behaviour . But it is not clear that this is a cause of transgenderism , rather than an effect . <h> Find out more <p> Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 18 March , 20:30 GMT and Sunday , at 21:30 GMT . <p> Hines thinks the male hormone , testosterone , may have a part to play . She has noticed that girls who have been exposed to unusually high levels in the womb tend to prefer stereotypical " boys ' toys " like trucks . And they are more likely than other girls to grow up wanting to live as men . <p> The UK 's main gender identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referrals last year . <p> There they are assessed by psychiatrists who will help them adjust to their preferred gender role . <p> After two years of living as the opposite sex in the UK , you can apply for a gender recognition certificate , which allows you to change your birth certificate . <p> To qualify , there is no obligation to have changed your body in any way through hormones or surgery . That means you can officially be a woman with a man 's body , or vice versa . <p> Stephen Whittle , professor of equalities law at Manchester Metropolitan University , realised as a 10-year-old that he did n't feel right as a girl . <p> " It was school races day and there were girls ' races and boys ' races . It was my light on the road to Damascus - this sudden realisation that I was always going to be in the wrong race . " <p> Image caption Stephen Whittle campaigns for transgender rights <p> At 17 , he started the process of changing sex . Surgery has left him with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers himself straightforwardly a man . <p> This is typical , says James Barrett , lead clinician at the Charing Cross National Gender Identity Clinic . Most of his patients identify as a man or a woman , rather than somewhere in between . <p> " People who are seeking drastic surgical or hormonal treatment because they wish to live in a socially ambiguous gender role ... are thought about really carefully . The concern is that one does n't want to do anything that 's irreversible and then have them in a position where they 're not happy . " <p> The problem is , says Dr Barrett , they have to fit in to a society that that thinks in terms of just two sexes . <p> " It may well be that biological findings report that , in fact , everybody 's on a spectrum . It 's just that the way society works , most people do n't think of themselves as on any kind of a spectrum at all . <p> " The same is probably true of sexual orientation . Most people do n't describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually , practically speaking , it very much is . " <p> Some transgender people do not choose to change their bodies completely , however . <p> This can lead to complicated situations , such as people who choose to live as women - but who have male genitalia - being sent to jail for sexual offences . Should they be imprisoned alongside men or women ? <p> Image caption Official documents typically ask if the respondent is " male " or " female " <p> The law is clear that such a woman should go to a women 's prison , says lawyer and former MP , Lord Carlile . He was the first to raise the issue of transgenderism in Parliament in the 1990s . <p> " If somebody goes into a court and is accused and their original name was ' John Smith ' and they choose to call themselves ' Jane Smith ' they will be tried as ' Jane Smith ' . I do n't see why what a court recognises should not also be recognised by the prison service . <p> " Awkward though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as challenging and difficult . " <p> According to Whittle , the UK is gradually removing the requirements for people to declare whether they 're a man or a woman . It has already happened with laws as diverse as the Sexual Offences Act and the Road Traffic Act . <p> He thinks the UK will follow Australia and Spain in doing away with the need to tick a box on your passport stating if you are male or female . <p> Which box does Richard O'Brien tick ? <p> " I tick the M , " he says . " But I would quite like to have Other to tick . " <p> Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 18 March , 20:30 GMT and Sunday , at 21:30 GMT .
