The surprising uses for birdsong  A 90-second daily show highlighting the songs of British birds has started on BBC Radio 4 this week . But birdsong is n't just beautiful to listen to , it is increasingly being used in surprising ways .  Can a nightingale 's song help you pass an exam or a blackbird 's twittering encourage you to open a bank account ? Sound experts are using it to do both .  They argue the positive results speak for themselves even though researchers say there is little hard scientific evidence to show people respond positively to birds singing . Most support for the theory is anecdotal .  So what are the innovative ways it is being used ?  Homework  Far too often noise can make it hard to concentrate , be it a loud television , loud traffic or loud people . But audio experts say certain sounds can make it easier to focus and they include birds singing .  Find out more  What makes birdsong so special is that it relaxes people physically but stimulates Business and chairman of noise consultancy The Sound Agency . Birdsong creates a state he calls " body relaxed , mind alert " .  " People find birdsong relaxing and reassuring because over thousands of years they have learnt when the birds sing they are safe , it 's when birds stop singing that people need to worry . Birdsong is also nature 's alarm clock , with the dawn chorus signalling the start of the day , so it stimulates us cognitively . "  Treasure has used birdsong to develop a free smartphone app called Study . It claims to be a " productivity-boosting " soundscape to listen to while you work . It can help focus , improve cognition and reduce tiredness , Treasure argues . It 's also designed to mask background noise that can disturb concentration , particularly conversation .  The effect of birdsong on our brains is being researched by Eleanor Ratcliffe . She is carrying out a three-year study looking at how natural sounds can improve mood and attention for her PhD in Environmental Psychology at the University of Surrey . The Wildlife Trust .  " We need to find out if , how and why birdsong can be of psychological benefit . Many people believe it is , " she says .  Post-meal slump  Birdsong in poetry  The nightingale has probably the most celebrated song , with John Keats describing the bird pouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy ! in his 1819 Ode to a Nightingale .  Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's 1798 poem The Nightingale reads : And hark ! the Nightingale begins its song . " Most musical , most melancholy " bird ! ... so his song should make all Nature lovelier , and itself be loved like Nature !  William Wordsworth wrote the skylark 's babbling song dost pour upon the world a flood of harmony in his 1805 verse To a Skylark .  In the science world it 's known as postprandial somnolence but in the everyday world it 's commonly known as the post-meal slump .  It 's the period after a meal when blood sugar levels drop , causing you to get sleepy .  likely solutions , researchers are looking into what can lift people out of this soporific state after lunch . Birdsong has been found to work , they say .  An experiment at a primary school in Liverpool - run by " sonic branding " company Condiment Junkie , Glyndwr University and architects Nightingale Associates - found that playing pupils a soundscape of birdsong and other natural sounds made them more alert and better able to concentrate after their lunch break .  The key to the most effective audio was lack of repetition , say those involved .  Birdsong works because it 's stochastic , made up of lots of random sounds . There is no repeating rhythm or pattern to focus on .  " It does n't get stuck in your head and annoy you but it does n't lull you to sleep and bore you either , " says Russell Jones , from Condiment Junkie .  " I 'm not sure there is any other sound that can do what birdsong does . It should be part of the soundtrack to everyone 's day . along the corridors of Alder Hey Children 's Hospital in Liverpool among the noise of everyday hospital life you will hear birdsong .  Patients recorded the sound of birds in a local park as part of a project with the Foundation for Creative Technology ( FACT ) and award-winning wildlife sound recordist Chris Watson .  Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport uses birdsong in a quiet lounge where people can relax before their flight . Along with other calming methods birdsong is played through speakers hidden in real trees . Last month the airport was voted the third best in the world at the World Airport Awards and last year 95% of passengers rated it as good or excellent , according to Schiphol 's own figures .  Such projects try to use native birdsongs as they think they will be most successful . Ratcliffe is looking at responses to different birdsong and , depending on the outcome , it 's a possibility that in the future people could be prescribed certain bits of birdsong to suit their individual needs .  " It would be nice to say to people says .  The National Trust suggests people listen to birdsong for a few minutes a day to combat low moods . Sound expert Julian Treasure agrees .  " It resets the ears , allows us to hear properly . Most of us walk around with our ears switched off because so much noise is unpleasant . Unlike so many other sounds there 's no maximum exposure to birdsong . "  Business  Treasure worked on one project in Colombia to rebrand a bank . As well as the visual side of things , a soundscape was also created that included birdsong .  The rebranding resulted in a " dramatic uplift " in people opening new accounts and customer approval ratings rose from 64% to 90% in just six months , says Treasure .  BP also used birdsong when research revealed toilets in its petrol stations were having a negative effect on customers ' feelings about the BP brand . A strategy was drawn up to improve the toilets including , among other things , a birdsong soundscape . The aim was to create a mental connection services in Cambridgeshire and across Europe . Customer satisfaction ratings rose by 50% , says Treasure .  " Architects need to start designing for our ears as well as our eyes , " says Treasure . " Businesses also need to recognise its importance . Good sound is good business . "
