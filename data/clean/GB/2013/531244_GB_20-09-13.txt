<h> England v South Africa fixtures <p> The sides will meet at Bath University on Sunday at 13:15 BST , at Wembley Arena , Wednesday 25 September ( 19:45 ) and at University Arena , Worcester , two days later ( 19:45 ) <p> A lack of funding in the sport means the players have no option but to support themselves financially . <p> It means that every minute of Cookey 's day is pre-planned , as she balances the demands of being an international sportswoman with a hectic career . <p> " I 've become amazing at time-management , " she explains to BBC Sport . " I segment my time so I know what I need to do and when I need to do it . <p> " It does get hard at times , this balancing act . But as long as I know I 've got my routine , then I can make it work . " <p> With Cookey at the helm , England have enjoyed unprecedented success . As well as superb victories over the ever-dominant Australians , they are unbeaten this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rankings . <p> " It 's a different team . Results have shown we are stronger and we 're a lot more cohesive . The new coaching staff has brought out the strength in all of us . I do n't think we had this strength in depth before , " Cookey insists . <p> Media playback is not supported on this device <p> ' Belief in ourselves ' led to success - Pamela Cookey <p> " The 3-0 against Australia was awesome and gave us so much confidence - it 's never been done before . The girls are looking really sharp , really vibrant . " <p> Cookey has been involved in the England set-up for more than a decade now and made her senior debut nine years ago . As England have strengthened their footing on the world stage , the sport 's profile has also risen across the country , which puts them in a prime position to overcome sixth-in-the-world South Africa in the forthcoming series . <p> " It 's changed dramatically . Head coach Anna Mayes has made such a difference to the senior squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to the squad and how to make us better , " says Cookey . <p> " England Netball governing body are doing more too - in terms of Back To Netball and all the events to get more people into the sport . And the media has more interest in us . " <p> But Cookey , who also plays for domestic league champions Team Bath , admits that while there has been an increase in participation figures and the sport has been given more funding , the players are still a while off becoming full-time professionals like the Australians and New Zealanders , who have long headed up the world rankings table . <h> A day in Cookey 's busy life <p> 05:50 - alarm clock goes off <p> 06:30 - first England training session at Bath University <p> 08:00 - after training and a shower , heads to work <p> 09:00 - working day at Airbus in Bristol begins <p> 16:00 - ends work , drives back to training in Bath <p> 17:00 - second England training session <p> 19:00 - training finishes <p> A typical day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full shift at work . Her morning alarm sounds at 5.50am and she does n't put her head back onto her pillow until about 10pm . Thoughts of clubbing rarely enter the 29-year-old 's head . <p> " There 's no chance of going out the night before - I can just about get up now ! " Cookey laughs after her first training session of the day at Bath University 's Sports Village . " Sometimes it 's good because you get out of bed and you just have to get on with it . Other times you 're half-asleep so do n't realise how hard you 're working . <p> " You have to put your all into it , otherwise you do n't get the full benefit . We have a good team ethos here and we pull each other along . There 'll be some days when you 're tired and you are struggling , so you 've just got to help each ... " Cookey 's phone alarm interrupts her . It 's 7.36am and she should be showering and getting ready for work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airbus 's Bristol base . By 9am Cookey is starting the second chunk of her day , running a team which audits buildings to ensure staff are in a clean and safe working environment . <p> " My colleagues are really supportive of my netball career . They say : ' We saw you on TV the other day , ' " says Cookey , who joined the company five years ago after starting on their graduate scheme . " What I do is very demanding , so to know my colleagues support me makes it a little bit easier . <p> " All that I 've picked up from sport has transferred to my job : teamwork , leadership , determination to do well , " she adds as she runs her finger across the top of a picture frame to test for dust . <p> " I 've made lots of sacrifices . Loads . Especially with family and friends and spending time with them because I 'm running around the place from one thing to another . " <p> At 4pm Cookey is meant to finish her day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 20 minutes late . Now it 's another rush-hour dash back to Bath for her evening training session . <p> By 7pm she has finally finished - and she 's still smiling . " It is difficult sometimes to keep going throughout the day , and at lunch I did have a little ' woah ' , " she breathes out strongly to demonstrate her midday slump . " But then I had some food . I 'm still buzzing now . " <p> It 's clear that despite the sacrifice and the long days , Cookey thoroughly enjoys her double life . <p> You can listen to live commentary of England 's first game against South Africa on the BBC Sport website from 13:15 BST on Sunday .
