' They must 've been one hell of a golfer , ' says commuter hit in face by 400-yd drive  A woman waiting for a tram was hit in the face by a golf ball after a freak 400-yard shot sent it over a driving range 's netting .  " Whoever it was must have been a hell of a golfer , " said Anne Mulholland , 66 , who was sitting at the stop in Croydon when the ball hit her .  She was left with a bruised chin and bleeding gums .  " It came from nowhere and I did n't see it . If I had seen it , I would have ducked . I am lucky it just hit my chin , " she said .  " If it had hit my eyes or brain , I could be dead now . We are so paranoid to stand at that tram stop now because of what happened . It could have been a child . "  The World of Golf range backs on to the Arena stop with her sister Vera Stork , 69 , who she lives with , and Jill Ebell , 62 , a cousin who was visiting from Australia .  Shortly after Mrs Mulholland was hit , three other balls flew over the netting , landing near the stop .  In reply to a letter of complaint from Ms Stork , World of Golf chief executive Grant Wright said he was " shocked " and " extremely sorry " about the incident , which happened at midday on Saturday July 27 , and pledged that there would be " a full investigation " .  He wrote : " In the last six years , since I have been chief executive , we have never had a ball strike a member of the public .  " During this period , that equates to more than 150 ? million balls hit at our centres . "  Keri Watkins , executive assistant at Tramlink , wrote : " Each year , over 500,000 people board and alight trams at Arena tram stop and in the 13 years that the trams have been heard of a person being hit by a golf ball . "  She said the company had worked closely with the driving range to avoid injury and damage .  But Ms Stork called for World of Golf and Transport for London to put more safety measures in place .  She said : " Will it take something worse than what happened to my sister to get something done about it ? "
