<p> My day usually starts at 7am with an early morning run with my cocker spaniel , Monty . I am a fair-weather runner but try to run three times a week , I prefer the early mornings . Most of my work is sitting down so this is an energising start to the day . <p> Once I have had breakfast , which is my favourite meal , I set off on the 35-minute drive to work . I am based at Southlands Assessment Unit , a mental health unit for older adults within the Kent and Medway partnership trust . Dementia UK is the charity behind the Admiral Nurse model , supporting us in our practice development and ensuring we all work consistently to the charity 's standards . <p> My day starts with a 9am appointment . Mr Jones is a younger carer who is supporting his wife ; she was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease when she was 53 . It is an emotional appointment , working through feelings of loss and adjustment -- Mr Jones has experienced lots changes to their relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my electronic records and make a couple of phone calls . I get a call from the reception to let me know my next client Miss White has arrived . It is a new referral so this will take up to two hours to assess and understand her needs . Miss White is struggling to care for her mother who lives with her and has a diagnosis of Lewy Body dementia . <p> I think I have the best job in the world , but it can be emotionally exhausting . I receive both managerial and clinical supervision from my manager . I also receive specific Admiral Nurse group clinical supervision with an independent facilitator provided by the Dementia UK as part of our practice development day . Clinical supervision provides an opportunity to talk through themes and reflect on some of the more complex cases . <p> I have worked within the mental health trust for 26 years ; the last four of those years have been within my current role . During my career , I have been supported to study psychotherapy , mindfulness CBT , counselling and behavioural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse registration has been hugely beneficial in my work . <p> Admiral Nurses are specialist mental health nurses who work clinically with families affected by dementia and particularly those with complex needs . We also provide consultancy in the form of teaching , education and raising the profile of dementia . I enjoy the mix of clinical and consultancy work , and although I am ambitious to progress within my career it is difficult to find a job that equals what I am doing now . I feel hugely privileged to have the opportunity to work with and be able to make a difference to the lives of the people I meet . <p> At 1.15pm , I leave the office to drive to the local university in Medway . I am going to talk to a first-year cohort of nursing students prior to their older adult placement . I present the Admiral Nurse role and talk about dementia . It is a lively group of students with lots of questions and some apprehensions . It is important that we are involved in this work to talk through common myths held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I finish at the university at 4pm ; my last appointment is with a lady whose husband has recently moved into residential care . She was his sole carer until his move and has struggled in making the decision . Mrs Smith developed some compulsive behaviour , and she has n't visited her husband since he left the marital home . She is tearful but she agrees to accompany me on a visit to see her husband . <p> This evening I am meeting friends for supper , so once home I walk Monty . We have a few games of chase the stick before getting ready to go out . When I get home at around 10pm , I have a cup of tea and cuddle with Monty before going to bed ... as I drift off to sleep , I think how lucky I am . <p> If you would like to feature in our series , or know someone who would , let us know by emailing us at **26;746;TOOLONG
