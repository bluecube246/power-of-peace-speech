financially-threatened swiss team sauber have announced a partnership with three russian companies which they hope will provide them with a " solid foundation " in the long term .  as part of the deal , 17-year-old formula renault 3.5 racer sergey sirotkin will be fast-tracked into a formula one race seat , possibly as early as next year .  sirotkin is the son of oleg sirotkin , who heads up the national institute of aviation technologies , one of the trio of russian companies involved in the partnership . the other two are the investment corporation international fund and the state fund of development of northwest russian federation .  sauber 's future has been the subject of increasing paddock speculation in recent months . last week , the hinwil-based team said they would not stand in the way of their star german driver nico hulkenberg quitting the team amid reports that he has not been paid .  team owner peter sauber denied those reports but admitted that the financial situation was " uncomfortable and embarrassing " .  sauber , who first entered to keep their heads above water since their last partner bmw decided to pull out of formula one at the end of 2009 . after a surprisingly strong campaign in 2012 , they have struggled on track this year .  " we are pleased to announce a partnership between the investment corporation international fund , the state fund of development of north-west russian federation and the national institute of aviation technologies with sauber motorsport ag , incorporating the promotion of the sport formula 1 in russia and jointly developing high-technological solutions , " said a sauber statement .  " with the national institute of aviation technologies , one of the leading scientific research institutions in russia , the sauber f1 team will benefit from the advanced know-how of the front-end russian scientists and engineers .  " the objective of the partnership is to open up new perspectives and revenue streams by commercialising jointly developed technologies . "  sirotkin , who has qualified in the top six five times in eight fr3.5 races this year , will not appear in this week 's young driver test at silverstone as well as hulkenberg .  but the intention is to have him in a race seat in time for next year 's inaugural russian grand prix in sochi .  " the partnership includes further activities for the promotion of the inaugural formula one grand prix in sochi in 2014 and attracting the talented young russian generation towards motorsport , " said the statement .  " in particular , a development programme will be set up for the russian driver sergey sirotkin to prepare him as a racing driver for the team in 2014 . "  the inclusion in the deal of the st petersburg-based state fund of development of northwest russian federation has led to speculation that sochi , a black sea resort and the host of next year 's winter olympics , may not end up being the venue for the russian gp in the long term .
