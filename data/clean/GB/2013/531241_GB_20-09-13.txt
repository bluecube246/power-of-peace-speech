<h> The humanitarian headache of bringing home Syria 's bodies <p> Female members of the ' Mother Aisha ' battalion -- an all female unit of the Syrian rebels -- sit together in Aleppo 's Salaheddine district Reuters <p> Khaled Erksoussi is planning to leave Syria . <p> The Damascus Secretary General of the Syrian Red Crescent -- 22 of whose volunteers have already been killed in the war -- was fired from his full time job with a Damascus telecoms company this week , probably because he spends too much time on humanitarian work . <p> The Red Crescent ca n't match his old salary . Besides , donor money is drying up , talented volunteers are already being poached abroad . And who wants to spend their time stuffing three-day old corpses into body-bags and negotiating with up to 12 different groups across the front lines ? <p> For this is also a gruesome story . Reader beware . <p> " It looks like there is no money any more from the donor side , " he says . " All our partners are suffering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you notice that when the chemical issue ( sic ) happened , in the UN Security Council , the first decision was to go in and investigate -- but what about the medical side ? It shows what is important : finding the guilty -- the victim does n't matter . " <p> Mr Erksoussi is a difficult man to disabuse -- the UN inspectors were not sent to point the finger at the guilty , but he has a good enough argument . Pointing the finger gets more credit than understanding the tragedy through which Mr Erksoussi 's colleagues work . <p> Take the body retrievals , most of them of soldiers killed by rebels -- dozens of them -- often brought home three at a time . " Sometimes they the insurgents play tricks . Not long ago , we went to collect the bodies of three soldiers . But the last body we were carrying , our people thought something was wrong . One of the bodies seemed to have wires attached to it . We left it in place . Now we have demanded that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both sides must take from the corpses what is on them , whatever it is , even ammunition . I do n't want to deal with a hand grenade in an ambulance ... " <p> Most recently , the Red Crescent has been ferrying cooked food into the hell-hole of Aleppo prison , a vast block held by government forces and guards but totally surrounded by rebels , in which hundreds of prisoners -- common criminals , detainees and insurgent enemies of the government -- are now held amid dirt and lack of sanitation and shellfire . <p> " We managed to get dozens of prisoners out who had officially finished their sentences and they just needed a safe passage out . But the first time we went there , one of the rebel groups fired a rocket-propelled grenade at one of our cars . They missed . Everything was in place and cleared with all the groups , but this one said : ' We are upset because you did n't talk to us . ' We said , ' well , we 'll shout next time -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one volunteer and killed a government judge ( who was ) with us . <p> " Last time , we had a team in Deir el-Zour and they were detained by the al-Nusra forces for seven hours . We were with an International Red Cross team and Jabhat al-Nusra hate what they call ' this damned Red Cross ' . We said , well , you 've been eating food with ICRC red crosses on without caring very much . " <p> Now the Red Crescent can supply even insurgent-held Raqaa with supplies , but not the centre of Aleppo city which has been besieged for a month . <p> Days of negotiations between government and rebel forces precede most body extractions . " They usually come out within two to three days . The rebels usually know the names of the soldiers they 've killed . The deal is done between them on the front lines . They use us as mediators to cross the front lines and get corpses out . When they make the deal , we get in touch with both sides to make sure it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually we put them in body bags . The bodies are sometimes left in the place where they were killed -- most of them shot -- but last time in Deraya ( a suburb of Damascus ) , they ( the rebels ) just pulled them from the place where they died to a house nearby where they gave them to us . " <p> The last two Red Crescent volunteers to be killed were in Homs two months ago when a mortar shell fell outside the local Red Crescent office . The war came to them . <p> Khaled Erksoussi speaks with great care about some elements of the Red Crescent 's work . I can well see why . More than 15 volunteers remain imprisoned by the regime . The problem of what is lawful and unlawful in war has been a major problem . " The government still regards the finding of a make-shift hospital as a victory " -- since it has usually been set up to help wounded insurgents who can not go to a government hospital -- " but this contradicts the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr Erksoussi believes that the fighting around Damascus has become more ferocious but " you ca n't win with force -- this idea is on both sides now . What 's preventing both of them from stopping is ' ego ' . It 's not like they 're equal . When a government thinks it is fighting terrorists or ' evil ' , you still have to be responsible for civilians . But unless you close the tap -- weapons and money -- it will continue forever . I ca n't say this place is going to hell -- because it 's already there . " <p> Weapons data is handed over to watchdog <p> Syria has sent the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons an " initial declaration " outlining its weapons program , the organisation said Friday . <p> Spokesman Michael Luhan told The Associated Press that the declaration is " being reviewed by our verification division . " The organisation will not release details of what is in the declaration . <p> The OPCW , which polices the treaty outlawing chemical weapons , is looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arsenal of poison gas and nerve agents as well as its production facilities . <p> However , diplomatic efforts to speed up the process are moving slowly . <p> A meeting initially scheduled for Sunday at which the OPCW 's 41-nation executive council was due to discuss a US-Russian plan to swiftly rid Syria of chemical weapons was postponed yesterday . No new date was immediately set and no reason was given for the postponement . AP
