The Cost of a Glass of Milk

<h> The Cost of a Glass of Milk <p> The sight of a dairy herd grazing upon a grassy field is a ubiquitous one in Britain and Europe , appearing on the labels of dairy products that we consume , as well as in the countryside itself . Yet it represents only a part of the European dairy industry . <p> What of the cows that we do not see ? Those with little or no access to those fields , those who are tethered and those who are pushed to their limits by excessive milk production ? This may not be a familiar image to many of us , but it is the stark reality for a shockingly high proportion of dairy cows across Europe . <p> Last summer my charity , Compassion in World Farming , carried out a series of undercover investigations at over 50 farms in Germany , Denmark and Spain , to find out what conditions were like for dairy cows in the EU . We were appalled by what we found . <p> Many cows were living in zero-graze conditions , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie down , and move a few steps in any direction . In Germany , 11 of the 14 farms we visited kept their cows tethered with chains in ' tie-stalls ' , some of them for the whole year . Living spaces were often barren and without straw , leading to painful sores and swollen joints from the hard floor , and some cows were found sitting in their own faeces . These cows were frequently forced to their limits to produce high yields of milk , becoming bony with exhaustion , and slaughtered , often at a young age , when their yield began to diminish . It makes for harrowing reading , I know . It 's even harder to see . <p> This research comes from just three countries , but is , we suspect , a good representation of dairy farming across Europe . It is estimated that over one third of dairy cows in the EU are ' zero-grazed ' and that a further one fifth are tethered in tie-stalls for at least part of the year . Even in the UK , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life indoors . <p> It seems ludicrous that such injustices should be legal , but the problem is , dairy cows are not specifically protected by EU law . Unlike other farm animals , such as poultry and pigs , there is no EU legislation which refers to dairy cow welfare specifically . <p> Last October , Compassion joined with the World Society for the Protection of Animals ( WSPA ) and ice cream maker Ben and Jerry 's in forming the Supporting Better Dairy coalition . The aim of our campaign is to urge the European Commission to bring in a species-specific Directive in order to ensure a set of minimum welfare standards for dairy cows across Europe . Today ( 23 October ) we will present the signatures of more than 250,000 EU citizens who agree to a representative of the European Commission . <p> We believe that every cow should have access to pasture during the grass-growing season , and be liberated from cruel practices such as tethering that we encountered in our investigations . Cows should be fed in a way that meets their dietary needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measures put in place to prevent their pain and suffering . <p> Cows are intelligent , sentient beings that deserve our respect and better protection . It is my hope that this meeting will be a significant step towards the much needed action for ensuring dairy cow welfare .
