tommy robinson has left the edl . but this is a change of key , not a change of message  tommy robinson feels he can no longer keep extremists in the party at bay getty images  the announcement yesterday morning that tommy robinson and kev carroll , co-founders of the english defence league , were to leave the group took many by surprise . by removing himself from the far-right movement , tommy robinson is changing his tactics , but -- as i learned at the press conference last night -- there 's little to suggest he will be denouncing islamophobic views anytime soon .  only this year , tommy was filmed at an edl organised street demonstration shouting how ' islam is not a religion of peace , it is fascist and violent ' , and last night tommy refused to take back comments made in the past concerning his views on islam .  he seemed wholly uncomfortable when faced with questions regarding his views on halal cuisine , and would not retract past comments that mosque-building in the uk should be , tommy still asserted he stands by past comments made about " links between islam and paedophilia . " however , last night the quilliam foundation , who broke the news of robinson 's retreat from the edl , were keen to reiterate that " tommy and kev do not hate muslims . " the two journalists next to me both commented at this point " something here is n't right " .  when asked if this was the easy way out for him , tommy said that he " only got 45 minutes sleep last night " . he 'd " neglected his wife and family " , he said , and told us he was " dreading going home " . at one point i came close to feeling sorry for the bloke who has had such a ' difficult ' time of it , but then i remembered he 's tommy robinson from the edl . it needs to be made clear , these men last night made no attempt to denounce actions of the edl in the past , nor the principles the edl stands for nawaz , co-founder and chairman of quilliam , an anit-extremism group , had only started speaking to the ex-edl frontmen over the " last couple of days . " it certainly was made no clearer at the press conference last night as to what the edl leadership had done to prove they were n't actually racist - but nawaz pointed out that he and his colleague were muslim , and therefore how could tommy be racist ?  in essence , i was left wondering what on earth was going on . for tommy and kev it 's clear they have a lot to gain from moving away from the edl , a failing organisation described by the men as " out of control " . this way they can be seen as more moderate , a voice of reason from the right .  moreover , with groups such as ukip finding such electoral success in the uk , is it any wonder that tommy and his cronies are looking for ' a more democratic ' way of pursuing their racist agenda ?  however , for quilliam , this nawaz was clear last night that the ex-edl leaders were to receive " training and education " through his foundation to " educate them on islam " . however , there was no plan presented of how this would take place , or what quilliam envisaged doing with their latest recruits . speaking to an international relations scholar last night at the university of oxford , who has spent time working with muslim community groups in the north , i was told that " nobody in the muslim community takes quilliam seriously . "  last night tommy asserted ' there are problems and we need to solve them . we must confront the problem but marching and chanting is offending moderates ' . clearly , he and carroll are trying a change of tactic , but their dangerous views have not suddenly been enlightened . " we are singing from the same song-sheet , just the same sheet as quilliam against islamism " carroll told the audience . forget quilliam , the song-sheet carroll and robinson hold is full of bile , and a change of key wo n't change @ @ @
