Why Happiness Should Be a Global Priority  This Wednesday sees the very first United Nations International Day of Happiness , which is being celebrated around the world on 20 March . This follows a recent resolution adopted by all members of the UN General Assembly calling for happiness to be given a greater priority . So why are people now taking happiness so seriously at national and global levels ?  Happiness means the quality of life as each person experiences it . This is a key outcome in itself and is an important measure of success for any country , regardless of the level of economic development . It tells us whether people are leading lives they find satisfying and fulfilling . So information on the causes of happiness helps policy-makers to choose policy goals that serve the real needs of their people .  But , in addition , happiness is a major determinant of the other goals that policy-makers care about . Personal resilience predicts educational performance better than IQ does ; and higher wellbeing improves work performance and workers ' earnings . at work , 40% of time off work and 40% of disability . Their overall cost amounts to some 10% of GDP . Greater happiness increases life expectancy ; by contrast depression reduces life expectancy as much as smoking does . So happiness is a major contributor to many of our most important social goals .  As a result of 30 years of research , we now know a lot about what affects happiness . The main influences are economic , personal/social and environmental . On the economic front , income is important in every country , and poverty is a major source of unhappiness . But it is not the only thing that matters . In most countries income explains less than 2% of the overall variance in happiness ( the other identifiable factors explain about 20% ) . Across countries , income differences explain about 6% of the differences in average happiness , while social factors explain a great deal more . Work is also vital for happiness and its importance goes well beyond the income which it provides . Education is also important , largely as a  Turning to personal/social determinants of happiness , the most important in developed countries is mental health . In these countries it accounts for 40% of all illness ( weighted by severity ) - more than heart disease , cancer , lung disease and diabetes all combined . It is also largely a disease of working age so that it has massive economic consequences , while physical illness is more concentrated in later life . In poorer countries by contrast physical illness has major impacts at every age but mental illness remains an equally important cause of low wellbeing .  Another crucial determinant of happiness is the quality of human relationships - above all in the family but also in the community and at work . Secure employment is vital for those who want to work and personal security against violence is vital for everyone . Good governance is essential too - wellbeing studies show the corrosive effect of corruption , and the crucial role of personal freedom and the rule of law .  Finally comes the environment . Research shows clearly the importance of today 's environment for design , transport systems , and green space . But the environment is also important in a quite different sense , since how we treat the planet today determines the world which future generations will inhabit . So when we are considering happiness and quality of life , we must take into account those future generations as well as our own .  The implications of all this evidence are far reaching . Here are six of the most important actions which are required if we want to create a happier society :  Mental Health . Evidence-based treatment should be as available for mental illness ( including depression and anxiety disorders ) as it is for physical illness .  Economic Policy . Employment is so important that no risks should be taken with economic stability , simply in order to increase economic growth .  Communities . Measures to promote economic growth should be accompanied by explicit policies to sustain social cohesion , stable family life , and personal security .  Equality . More equal incomes are desirable because extra money improves wellbeing more for the poor than a country increases mutual respect and trust , which are crucial for wellbeing .  Schools . Schools should aim explicitly at developing young people who are emotionally resilient and eager to contribute to the social good .  Families . Stable families are so important that every society needs its own system of support for couples in conflict .  Governments should make the happiness of the people the main outcome which they pursue . As Thomas Jefferson said " The care of human life and happiness ... is the only legitimate object of good government " . That is why there is now a growing demand to include subjective wellbeing in the new post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals .  But , perhaps most importantly of all , we need to encourage a more empathic and caring culture , where people care less about what they can get for themselves and more about the happiness of others .  This is why I 'm supporting the Day of Happiness , when Action for Happiness is encouraging people everywhere to make a personal pledge to live in a way that contributes made that our central purpose in life we would have a far happier and more cohesive world .
