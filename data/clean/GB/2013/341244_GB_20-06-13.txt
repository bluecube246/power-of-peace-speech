The funnyman was due to perform in Abu Dhabi and Lebanon as part of his Messiah world tour but will no longer stop off there due to a threat from extremists .  He told BBC Radio 5 Live : " Those gigs have been banned , pulled because of threats from extremists that if I went there there would be problems .  " The venue contacted us and said , ' We can no longer guarantee your safety . ' "  Russell was due to tour in discussing political and religious figures such as Malcolm X and Ghandi and he also claims the promotional poster for the shows may have gone some way to causing the cancellations .  The star added that the content of the shows could cause problems at the venues in the Middle East due to its potentially offensive nature in the region .  He said : " The poster image by the brilliant artist Shepard Fairey depicts me as looking a little Christ-like ... so there 's an indication that it might be offensive .  " If you are in some sort of fundamentalist group and Google my name and watch a few things on YouTube you might just think , ' Do n't bother having him here . ' "  Performances in Europe , South Africa , the US and Canada are still planned to go ahead .
