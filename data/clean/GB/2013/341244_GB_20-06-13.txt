" the venue contacted us and said , ' we can no longer guarantee your safety . ' "  russell was due to tour in discussing political and religious figures such as malcolm x and ghandi and he also claims the promotional poster for the shows may have gone some way to causing the cancellations .  the star added that the content of the shows could cause problems at the venues in the middle east due to its potentially offensive nature in the region .  he said : " the poster image by the brilliant artist shepard fairey depicts me as looking a little christ-like ... so there 's an indication that it might be offensive .  " if you are in some sort of fundamentalist group and google my name and watch a few things on youtube you might just think , ' do n't bother having him here . ' "  performances in europe , south africa , the us and canada are still planned to go ahead .
