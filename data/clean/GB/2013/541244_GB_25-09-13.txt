<h> Capital One Cup : Stoke City capable of reaching final says Mark Hughes <p> Stoke City , managed by Mark Hughes , take on Crystal Palace at the Britannia Stadium <p> Stoke boss Mark Hughes has no doubt his side have it in them to go all the way to the Capital One Cup final this season . <p> As a player Hughes won the League Cup on three occasions - one time each at Manchester United , Chelsea and Blackburn . <p> And as a manager he got both Rovers and Manchester City to the semi-finals , although in the latter case he lost his job before the last-four tie took place . <p> The Welshman has been in charge of the Potters since the summer and is feeling optimistic about his chances of more success in the competition this term . <p> Speaking ahead of the third round trip to Sky Bet League One outfit Tranmere , Hughes told Stoke Player : " It is a good competition for me - it has been as a player and I 've done okay as a manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be nice this year to go one step further if we can , and it is certainly within our capabilities . <p> " A lot of Premier League sides are playing each other in this round , so that will take a number of teams out of the equation . <p> " So if we can get through this round , then hopefully we can keep on progressing . " <p> Stoke have made a fairly encouraging start to the season , taking seven points from their opening five top-flight fixtures as well as seeing off Walsall , another third tier team , 3-1 at home in the Capital One Cup second round . <p> They have also earned praise for what has been regarded as an improved playing style compared to their seasons under previous manager Tony Pulis . <p> Hughes feels things are going well but has stressed his Potters side are still very much a work in progress . <p> And with that in mind , he does not view the fact the Staffordshire outfit have to play the Tranmere tie just three days after their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> " The more games we can play , the better for the group in terms of what we are trying to do , " Hughes said . <p> " At this point in the season , we are still very much a work in progress , so games will help us . <p> " We will get better as we play more often together . <p> " I feel we have taken huge strides in a small space of time but we need to keep the performance levels going in the right direction . " <p> Hughes , who made eight changes to his first XI for the Walsall game , will reshuffle his pack . <p> Goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen will definitely come in for the rested Asmir Begovic , while Erik Pieters will sit the contest out having picked up a calf problem that is not expected to threaten his involvement in Sunday 's home league match against Norwich . <p> Fellow defender Marc Muniesa is available to play again after his groin injury .
