<h> Foster &amp; Allen on their new autobiography and five decades of success <p> WHEN Tony Allen left technical school in his home town of Moate , County Westmeath in 1967 , he could not possibly have envisaged the incredible music career that was to follow . <p> His story of success is the subject of a new autobiography with his cohort Mick Foster , entitled After All These Years : Our Story . Tony first met Mick Foster when they both played in the same local band , The Nightrunners , and were both in and out of the Irish Midlands ' trad scene . <p> So how did they eventually get from playing in local bands to performing on TV and the world 's concert stages -- selling millions of records along the way ? And how did he and Mick end up working as a duo in 1975 ? <p> Tony takes up the story : " We had done some gigs in London with the band and Paddy Callaghan had taken over The Prince of Wales pub in Kilburn , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there so the rest of the band went home and we stayed on " . <p> " That was really the start of the duo . Mick had been on to me to leave the band The Nightrunners . He had seen the Alexander Brothers from Scotland when they came over to Ireland and he thought there should be an Irish version . <p> " He eventually persuaded me to leave the band and go on the road -- just the two of us . I was playing organ and keyboards at the time and Mick was on the accordion so we went down the road as Foster &amp; Allen doing the local pubs and traveling all over the country playing pubs and GAA halls . <p> " At that stage the ballad scene had developed into a sort of cabaret scene . A lot of the bands had broken up and formed smaller groups and the cabaret scene was going great . In 1978 we signed a record deal with Donie Cassidy . We had just released The Blacksmith and then Bunch of Thyme which went to number one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London with Mick Clerkin and it went into the British record charts . We got on Top of the Pops and that really started the whole thing going outside Ireland . It then went from strength to strength and we are still kicking around at it " . <p> In such a long career there must have been many highlights ? " I think for us it would have to be our appearance on Top of the Pops in 1982 , " says Tony . <p> " That changed the whole thing for us . If you think about it , we went from playing the likes of The Prince of Wales in Kilburn or the Irish Club in Birmingham , to doing a concert tour of England -- the big theatres . Our records were being played on all the regional stations . That was a big change " . <p> " Then in 1983 Maggie came out and Mick McDonagh , the man who put the Green Velvet albums together , sent the song to Ken Harding in Australia . Ken released it as a single and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five weeks so that established us over there " . <p> Tony was anxious to acknowledge the importance of the Green Velvet compilation albums that did so well in the British charts . <p> " Because they were backed by a TV advertising campaign they brought Irish folk music into the mainstream . Apart from Foster &amp; Allen tracks they featured De Dannan with Mary Black , The Fureys , Irish Mist and Brendan Grace , who was huge at the time . <p> " It meant people who might not have been too familiar with Irish folk music were now being exposed to it at peak viewing times and they latched on to it . " <p> The importance of national TV advertising can not be overstated in the success of Foster &amp; Allen . <p> In relation to the way that daytime television has changed Tony said : " In the old days you could do something like Pebble Mill at One and the whole country would see it . You could be on all day now and hardly anyone would see it because there are so many stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have the book out now which tells our own individual stories and the story of the band . A new single is also due out shortly plus of course the UK tour coming up . It 's good to be still at it after all these years , which by coincidence just happens to be the title of the book " . <p> Foster &amp; Allen begin their British tour at the end in Tunbridge Wells on October 29 and tour throughout November .
