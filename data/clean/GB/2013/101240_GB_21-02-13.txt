<h> Private prisons ' are run better ' than those in public sector <h> Private firms are better at running prisons than the public sector and all jails should be subject to open competition , an independent think-tank said today . <p> Better staff-prisoner relationships , boosted by the use of first names and mentoring schemes , help rid private jails of hostilitiesPhoto : PA <p> 2:45AM GMT 21 Feb 2013 <p> The Government would be wrong to limit the role of private companies within prisons to small contracts such as maintenance and catering , the right-leaning group Reform said . <p> Some 10 out of 12 privately managed prisons have lower reoffending rates among offenders serving 12 months or more than comparable public sector prisons , Reform found . <p> Meanwhile , the group also called for the end to national pay bargaining for prison officers with pay and conditions to be set locally by governors . <p> The coalition Government denied there had been a ' ' U-turn ' ' on the use of prison competition , while campaigners for prison reform said it was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanner , who penned the report The Case for Private Prisons , said : ' ' Twenty years of private prisons have created an effective market which is ready to grow . Evidence shows that a greater role for the private sector will advance the ' rehabilitation revolution ' which ministers want to deliver . ' ' <p> Private firms have been managing prisons since 1992 , but in November last year Justice Secretary Chris Grayling signalled a move away from wholesale privatisation as he decided four prisons , including G4S-run HMP Wolds , should be run by the public sector . <p> Two contracts to run five prisons -- Acklington and Castington , which have since formed Northumberland prison , and three in South Yorkshire -- will proceed to the next stage of the competition with an announcement expected next spring . <p> Mr Grayling said private firms will be brought in to all public prisons to run maintenance , resettlement and catering to save up to ? 450 million over six years . <p> Policy groups , including Reform , said the decision amounted to the end of competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Mr Grayling insisted it did not rule out further prison-by-prison competitions in the future . <p> Looking at Ministry of Justice data , Reform said this decision was not supported by analysis of prison effectiveness . <p> Some seven out of 10 privately managed prisons have lower reoffending rates among offenders serving fewer than 12 months , compared to comparable public sector prisons . <p> Furthermore , Reform said private prisons outperform their public counterparts in four of the performance measures used by the MoJ . <p> A total of 12 out of 12 private jails performed better than the public sector at ' ' resource management and operational effectiveness ' ' , while seven out of 12 were better at ' ' reducing re-offending ' ' . <p> However , seven out of 12 public prisons performed better than private jails at ' ' public protection ' ' . <p> In the report , Mr Tanner argues : ' ' Private contractors outperform comparable public sector prisons on both cost and quality , delivering better value for money for the taxpayer . <p> ' ' In addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar public sector prisons for both long and short-term prisoners , a key Government objective . ' ' <p> As a result , Reform recommends that all prisons should be subject to competition including the private sector . <p> It also calls for local pay decision-making to be introduced in prisons , with governors taking on responsibility for deciding staffing arrangements , pay and conditions and performance-related pay . <p> This would spell the end of national pay bargaining for prison officers , a move that would spark fury among unions . <p> Mr Tanner said : ' ' Market-facing pay and adaptable staffing arrangements have not only reduced cost considerably but also improved staff-prisoner relationships and internal cultures within prisons . ' ' <p> Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said : ' ' Reoffending rates across the entire prison estate are too high and we are pressing ahead with major reforms to tackle this unacceptable problem . <p> ' ' And let 's be clear -- there has been no U-turn on the use of prison competition . <p> ' ' The cost of running our prisons is too high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new approach for reducing costs and improving services aimed at reducing reoffending at a faster rate involving the private sector . ' ' <p> Mr Wright added : ' ' This simplistic analysis does not tell the whole story -- a wide range of factors contribute to reoffending including previous criminal behaviour , drug and alcohol dependency and the support offenders receive on release from prison . This is why we are committed to introducing significant reforms that will bring down our stubbornly high reoffending rates . ' ' <p> She said : ' ' It is almost impossible to compare the performance and reoffending rates of one establishment with another , partly because prisons hold different categories of offenders and also because prisoners often serve their sentences in a number of different jails .
