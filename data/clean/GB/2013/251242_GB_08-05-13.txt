People who obsessively take pictures of what they are eating or cooking and post them online may be ill , according to a leading expert .  Foodstagramming is a trend which involves taking pictures of your food and posting it on Instagram and Twitter .  The craze has become so popular that some restaurants have stopped customers from taking photos of their meals because the flashes and manoeuvrings of food disrupts other diners .  Craze : A recent ' foodstagram ' shows a person 's birthday cake which they could n't resist eating before taking a picture  In January , Michelin-starred New York chef David Bouley banned customera who foodstagrammed in his restaurant .  But Dr Valerie Taylor , chief of psychiatry at Women 's College Hospital at the University of Toronto , argues that religiously documenting each meal might not only be annoying but the sign of a more sinister problem too .
