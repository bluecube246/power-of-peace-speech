<p> People who obsessively take pictures of what they are eating or cooking and post them online may be ill , according to a leading expert . <p> Foodstagramming is a trend which involves taking pictures of your food and posting it on Instagram and Twitter . <p> The craze has become so popular that some restaurants have stopped customers from taking photos of their meals because the flashes and manoeuvrings of food disrupts other diners . <p> Craze : A recent ' foodstagram ' shows a person 's birthday cake which they could n't resist eating before taking a picture <p> In January , Michelin-starred New York chef David Bouley banned customera who foodstagrammed in his restaurant . <p> But Dr Valerie Taylor , chief of psychiatry at Women 's College Hospital at the University of Toronto , argues that religiously documenting each meal might not only be annoying but the sign of a more sinister problem too . <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> ' I see clients for whom food has become problematic , and they struggle to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction : what they eat , when they ate , when they are going to eat again , ' Dr Taylor told The Huffington Post . <p> Dr Taylor gave a talk at the Canadian Obesity Summit in Vancouver last week about eating disorders and the role that food plays in modern society and culture . <p> ' The concern becomes when all they do is send pictures of food , ' she added . <p> Fast foodstagramming : The trend is even leading people to document the more mundane food they consume <p> ' We take pictures of things that are important to us , and for some people , the food itself becomes central and the rest - -- the venue , the company , et cetera -- is background . ' <p> While Taylor argues that producing such images may signal an unhealthy preoccupation with food and in turn an eating disorder , others have linked the consumption of food photography to weight gain .
