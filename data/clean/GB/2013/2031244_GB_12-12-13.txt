<h> Artist Blog Daniel Green of Laish -- The Congested Noisy Cloud <p> Hi ! Pleased to meet you . In case we have n't met before , my name is Daniel and I am the singer , guitarist and songwriter who goes out under the name , Laish ( lie-shh ) . I 've been kicking around in Brighton and now London for a wee while , bandying this rather awkward band name about on posters in large , bold fonts . I 've released a couple of albums , a few music videos , and played a hundred odd gigs , both solo and with a tremendous band . And all of the music I have created , I have just set as a free download on Bandcamp . <p> Why ? <p> Well , here 's the thing . The most recent album , Obituaries , was released in March . There was a huge spike of interest during the release campaign as I did all the things a switched-on , modern musician does for his/her baby . I spent a load of money getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record label to help distribute the album into record shops and online retailers . I invested some serious cash into a press and a radio campaign . I organised release parties in London and Brighton . I organised a UK tour . I arranged for a couple of wonderful music videos to be created . I Tweeted and Facebooked to my heart 's content .... <p> I coordinated this whole military operation because it was my job to do so and because it feels great to do all these things . It is hard labour , but it is a labour of love . It is very satisfying watching all this work lead to something . People were finally listening to my music and enjoying it and the reviewers were writing very positive reviews . And some people were buying the CD and paying for the download . Hurrah ! <p> But a release has a life span . The sales have stopped . Flatlined . I am still yet to recoup the costs I spent on producing and marketing the album . And now the album is old ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as people discover the songs from that album they can stream it all for free on Bandcamp . You can stream it all for free on Spotify . You can watch all the videos on Youtube for free . It 's all for free ! Everything is free ! <p> So I set them as free download on Bandcamp four days ago and did a few tweets about it . Here 's a stat . A third of every copy of the Obituaries album that has ever been downloaded from my Bandcamp page happened in the last four days . <p> If people do n't want to pay for it , why fight it ? Will those people invest later on in the Laish fund ? Maybe . It 's a risk . Perhaps they will fall in love with the Obituaries album and come and see my next show . Or perhaps they will be ready to spend ? 8-10 on the next NEW album . <p> I decided that I would rather someone download my music from my own outstretched arm than do it sneakily from a torrent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download and gave me their email address so I can tell them about the next gig and new release than listening to it on Spotify , as an anonymous and passive listener . <p> The reverse option would be to remove my albums from as many free services as possible . Take down all the Youtube videos . Remove it from Spotify . Set the Bandcamp album so that only a couple of tracks are streamable and you must buy it to hear the rest . Well I could do that . But doing so would be to fly in the face of the internet . I would only further encourage the torrenters and I would simply reduce any online presence the name Laish would have . We would be invisible . <p> We live in the internet age . As musicians or content creators we are all simply contributing to a congested and noisy cloud . Increasingly people do n't want the physical product of the cd . They just want the music , silly . So we 're asking people to pay for something essentially invisible that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few teething problems with this arrangement . <p> So instead I scream loudly from my desk : " Take it , take it all ! " <p> It would be my honour and pleasure to freely contribute to your iTunes library . Add Laish to a playlist . Find a suitable time to listen to it . It 's definitely not party music , perhaps it 's too intense to listen to when you 're making love . Maybe it 's driving music . You could definitely clean a mean kitchen to it . Why not send one of our videos to that guy on Tinder you want to impress . Or do a Tweet about the varying lengths of my hair on Google images . Come see me at a show and tell me what you think . Buy the cd as a Christmas present for that uncle who still has a cd player . <p> Lend us a tenner . <p> Just do n't ever ask me to play a gig for free . Unless you like emails that contain only one line and are 60% swear word .
