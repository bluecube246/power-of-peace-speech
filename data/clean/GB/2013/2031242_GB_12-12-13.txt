6 global catastrophes that could kill your gadgets forever  Lock up your tech , disaster is on its way  Since the Sony Walkman crashed onto the shelves worldwide in 1980 , consumer technology has slowly been taking over our lives .  From washing machines to digital watches and from electronic word processors to modern tablet computers , the march of technology has been unstoppable .  It now sits at the heart of everything we do , as we manage our schedules with Google Calendar , keep in touch via Facebook and mobile phones and entertain ourselves with games consoles and Netflix .  But it could all change in an instant . The ( atrocious ) NBC drama series Revolution explores what the world would be like if all technology were to suddenly stop working . An appalling prospect , but could it actually happen ? Here are six scenarios for the death of tech .  1 . Financial collapse  Bubbles always burst in the end , and a catastrophic failure of the global markets would certainly stagnate the development of collapse of this nature is certainly not hard to imagine . Indeed , technology itself has often been blamed for financial crisis in the first place . The late Charles P Kindleberger was just one of the historians to lay the blame for many a crash at the door of technological innovations .  The truth is that technology changes the world in ways that are rarely predicted . It brings us back to the well-trodden theory that humans will eventually destroy themselves . But if there 's one looming disaster that could cause the mother of all financial disasters and the end of the connected , technological world as we know it , it 's be the ( hypothetical ) horror story of peak oil ...  Tech that might survive:Bitcoin becomes the de facto currency of the new order ! Litecoin rebels plot in secret for global domination .  2 . Peak oil  Peak oil refers to the exact point in human history where oil production reaches its absolute peak and then begins to decline until it runs dry completely . The theory goes that when this rise as supply diminishes , causing huge and unstoppable price escalations ( sound familiar ? ) , eventually reaching the point where no one can afford oil anymore , bringing the whole industrialised world to a grinding halt .  So why is this relevant to technology ? Well because everything we know and rely on in the 21st Century is entirely dependent on an ever increasing supply of oil out of the ground . This is how we 're able to continue printing money every day without inflation taking over , making tangible oil supplies absolutely critical to sustainable economies . But more than that , oil is used in practically every single aspect of human life , including the , conception , design , manufacture and shipping of our gadgets .  " All plastic is oil . Most paints , all pesticides are made from oil . Everything from toothpaste to toothbrushes is made from oil . There are 7 gallons of oil in every tyre . There is nothing anywhere in any combination that will replace the edifice built by fossil fuels . Nothing . " Michael the manufacture process , it 's used to build cars and planes and ships and to fuel the transportation of products around the world . It 's the most important raw material on our planet and when it 's gone , there will be nothing to replace it . In short , without oil , there would be no way for Foxconn to manufacture Apple 's iPhones , and certainly no way to then ship them around the world . The fact is that oil is a finite resource and one day it will run out . On top of that , we do n't even have any idea how much oil is left , and when it runs out we could see the biggest population crash in human history .  Tech that might survive : Hand made tools and toys . Use them to plough the garden to grow your own food . Pee on everything .  3 . Solar superstorm  Every joule of energy we use on Earth ultimately comes from the sun . But the sun also looms over us as one of our biggest out the hydro-electric power grid in Canada , leaving millions of Canadians and Americans without power .  A massive solar flare has the power to knock out satellites , communications systems and damage the digital technologies we now all use daily  A massive solar flare has the power to knock out satellites , communications systems and damage the digital technologies we now all use daily - phones , tablets , computers , smartwatches . Most of these things did n't exist in the 1980s . Hurricane Katrina cost in the region of $100m to recover from - a solar storm could cost up to $2trillion .  Some studies of solar activity say the risk of a serious event will peak in 2015 , threatening to leave many places without power for months . It might not even be our own sun that bathes us in this harmful radiation . Any star in our galaxy within a few tens of lightyears would cause mayhem beyond imagination if it went supernova or worse , hypernova .  Tech that might survive : Mechanical timepieces . Your digital watch is dead  4 . Cyber terrorism  There are many ways that an unprecedented cyber attack could take down our tech and change the world forever . Computer viruses could , in theory , devastate our infrastructure to the point where every digital device on the planet would be left useless . Stuxnet is one active example of this threat .  Stuxnet is an infamous computer worm and was first detected in 2010 . Of unknown origin , it 's assumed to have been coded by the US and Israel in order to destroy Iran 's uranium enrichment infrastructure . The worm is highly complex and spreads indiscriminately between all kinds of devices , searching for and targeting the very specific computer codes that control the centrifuges inside nuclear power stations .  " We 've connected all of our lives - personal , professional and national , to the Internet . That 's where the bad guys will go because that 's where our lives are , our money , our secrets . " FBI Director James Comey  Whatever its original purpose , the worm escaped into the wild control from device to device all over the world , attempting to find more nuclear centrifuges to destroy ( it spins them out of control so that they disintegrate , while fooling computer systems and engineers into believing all systems are running normally ) .  Now imagine a super-worm that 's designed to do a similar thing to Android smartphones and Windows PCs and you 've got a potentially world-changing technological disaster on your hands . Cyber terrorism has so far been only a minor threat but it 's likely to become a more serious obstacle in the decades ahead .  Nuclear oblivion comes hand in hand with an additional threat , of course - the dreaded electromagnetic pulses which have the same sort of effect as a geomagnetic storm . A large nuclear bomb detonated high in the atmosphere above a developed country could potentially kill every mobile phone , computer , car and power station in the area . A carefully targeted EMP attack could bring a developed country to its knees .  Tech that might survive : The wind-up radio . Unfortunately as transmitters are there 's nothing to listen to except the sounds of the cosmos , natch.  6 . Heat death of the universe  This is some way off , but it 's worth mentioning because there is a fundamental law of physics - the second law of thermodynamics - that says that eventually , every gadget and piece of technology , along with every living organism and every celestial object in the entire universe , will one day disintegrate and die .  The only way to escape this cold fate would be to either travel back in time or escape to another dimension . As the universe expands it will reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium , or maximum entropy , a state of zero thermodynamic free energy . So there would be no stars , no planets , no people and no iPhone 4,569,000 's . Even individual atoms will decay into sub-atomic particles .  " With or without warp drives , the long-term fate of the cosmos can not be postponed or avoided . No matter where you hide , you will be part of a universe DeGrasse Tyson  Of course , for this death to be sealed , every black hole in the universe would have to evaporate through Hawking Radiation which would take about a googol ( 10 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 , ? 000 ) years . So you 've still just about got time to charge your Galaxy Tab before we all head over to Milliways , the restaurant at the end of the universe ( this is , of course , impossible ) .
