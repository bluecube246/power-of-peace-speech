<p> The awkward job of transporting a canoe could soon be a thing of the past after an inventor has designed one that can be packed down to the size of a suitcase . <p> Called a Stakanoo , the boat is made of three sections that slot together in less than a minute to create the 7.6ft vessel . <p> These sections can then be separated and packed inside each other to make the 19kg boat fully portable so that it fits in the boot of a car with one seat folded down , on the backseats or stored in a cupboard at home . <p> A keen canoeist and inventor from Somerset has designed a portable kayak . The Stakanoo , pictured , is made of three sections that slot together and can be stacked together to fit into the back of a car or stored in a cupboard <p> When packed away , the Stakanoo can fit comfortably into a car boot , pictured left , as well as sit across the backseat , right . The boat only weighs 19kg which means it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 seconds without the need for any specialist tools <h> THE ? 800 FOLDABLE ORIGAMI BOAT <p> Last year two design students from London created a foldable boat based on the ones created using origami . <p> The full-size vessel is folded from a 8ft by 5ft piece of plastic and can be transformed from a flat sheet to a rowing boat by a single person in two minutes using only three components . <p> Another model of the ? 800 ' Foldboat ' can be folded up and carried in a backpack <p> The single sheet of plastic can be folded over and over again up to 6,000 times and comes in two designs - one that folds into an easy-to-carry parcel and one that unfolds completely flat . <p> The Stakanoo is the brain child of keen canoeist and inventor Stuart Woodward from Bath , Somerset . <p> Woodward designed the vessel as a solution to motorists stacking canoes and kayaks onto the roof of their cars . <p> He wanted to design a canoe that could be packed into the boot of a car to negate the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel efficiency because there is less drag created as the car drives on a motorway . <p> The Stakanoo is made up of three slottable compartments - the tip of the bow connects to a section containing the seat and the midship , which then slots into the stern . <p> These sections have been designed in such a way so that they fit inside one another . <p> Woodward claims it only takes 60 seconds to assemble the Stakanoo and less time to fold it down . <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> Share this article <p> And because the sections slot together , this can be done single-handedly without any tools . <p> When the three sections are fitted together the full length of the Stakanoo is 7.6ft long and 2.25ft wide . <p> This series of images shows how the three slottable sections of the Stakanoo fit together to form the 19kg portable boat , pictured top . These sections can then be unpacked and fitted together to form the 7.6ft vessel , pictured bottom , with the seat added <p> When it is packed away , the boat can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 46-year-old inventor started on the design in September last year following his trip to the coast and completed his first canoe in May . <p> He has now built two fibreglass Stakanoos , which are on sale with Bristol Boats in Saltford , and has a patent pending . <p> Woodward is then hoping to liaise with a canoe manufacturer and he has two more variants designed in a longer , more traditional canoe shape with splashdecks fitted , which he hopes to make in the future . <p> The Stakanoo is the brain child of 46-year-old Stuart Woodward , pictured in his invention , from Bath , Somerset . Woodward wanted to design a portable alternative to roof-mounted canoes <p> Woodward 's Stakanoo costs ? 465 . Only two models are currently available in Bristol but the inventor plans to sell them across the country soon <p> He said : ' I was in Cornwall last year and saw lots of canoes being transported on the roofs of cars , and thought there must be a better way of doing that . <p> ' I started designing a take-apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more room than a large suitcase to make transport easier . <p> ' It fits in the car , so the car has maximum fuel economy on motorways . <p> ' It 's also much safer as it ca n't fall off the roof and it is easy to park in car parks as there is nothing overhanging . <p> ' It is easy to store when at home - you can place it under the stairs , in the garage or shed , in the loft . ' <p> ' After two designs were not what I wanted , I found a way of making the sections slot together with no bolts , straps or tools . <p> ' I have taken it out on the river extensively and it paddles very well and turns in a tight circle . <p> It is a fun hybrid between a kayak and a canoe and you can you can just pack it up , put into in your boot and away you go .
