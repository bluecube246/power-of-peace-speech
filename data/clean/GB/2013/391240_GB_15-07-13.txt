<h> Hundreds of puffins and pufflings getting ready to leave Scotland <p> Hundreds of puffins and their newborn pufflings are getting ready to leave Scotland as the breeding season comes to and end . <p> The colourful birds have been nesting on islands in the Forth off North Berwick , East Lothian for the past few months . <p> The population has managed to successfully breed despite severe weather conditions which saw around 3500 of the birds die . It also delayed the breeding season by around three weeks . <p> Now they are preparing to return to the Atlantic Ocean and anyone keen to see them before they leave has until the end of July . <p> Tom Brock , from the Scottish Seabird Centre , said : " We were concerned about the large number of puffin fatalities right up the east coast just before the start of the breeding season this year , which was probably due to late spring storms and malnourished birds . <p> " However , I am pleased to say that all indications are that this year 's breeding season has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them carrying sand eels -- always a sure sign that they have chicks to feed - and for the last few weeks , visitors have able to spot the birds nesting with their chicks on Isle of May and Craigleith . <p> " The fact that the breeding season started late does n't mean we can expect the birds to remain in the area for longer than normal however , and the last week in July will probably the last chance to see them this year , until they return to breed again next May .
