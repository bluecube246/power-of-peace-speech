This 59.60 carat stone is simply off any scaleDavid Bennett , Sotheby 's chairman , Europe &amp; Middle East  Sotheby 's David Bennett says the diamond belongs in " the ranks of the earth 's greatest natural treasures " .  It is over twice the size of the 24.78-carat " Graff Pink " diamond that set the world auction record for $46.2m .  The gem , which was mined by De Beers in Africa in 1999 , has received the highest possible colour and clarity rating from the Gemological Institute of America ( GIA ) .  It weighed 132.5 carats in the rough , and was cut and polished over a York-based auction house said in a statement on Wednesday .  " I have had the privilege of examining some of the greatest gemstones in the world over the past 35 years , and I can say , without hesitation , that the Pink Star diamond is of immense importance , " said Mr Bennett , chairman of Sotheby 's jewellery division in Europe and the Middle East .  He said it was very rare to have vivid pink diamonds weighing only five carats , " so this 59.6-carat stone is simply off any scale " .  The diamond , which was previously known as the " Steinmetz Pink " , was sold privately in 2007 but neither the price nor the owner was disclosed .  The auction is scheduled to take place on 13 November .  Sotheby 's will also auction a white diamond and a blue diamond , valued at more than $28m and $19m respectively , in Hong Kong in October .
