<h> Vinyl record sales are at a 10-year high , but feeding the habit these days requires patience , research and stamina , says Joshua Burt <p> Back in the olden days , when I started collecting music , you basically had two options : vinyl or tape ? <p> This proved to be not much of a dilemma at all , considering one option was clearly more lovable and charming than the other - the former being a gorgeous disc of inescapable beauty , the other an unruly plastic rectangle destined to be chewed up and spat out by your crumby hi-fi . <p> Now , years later , the choices facing music lovers are manifold , from iTunes to Spotify , from the countless other digital options to CDs ( wait , can you still buy CDs ? ) . Yet one thing has n't changed : I 'm still pretty much vinyl only . <p> I 'm used to it , I 'm loyal to it and I prefer the look , feel and sound of it -- as , it seems , does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic upsurge in vinyl record sales , which is now at a 10-year high . For many of this new breed of vinyl junkies , record shopping is not the instinctive , practical act that it was for their elderly hunter-gatherer forefathers ; it is an ancient skill to be learnt , like stonemasonry or grammar . <p> Like any ancient skill , the raw materials are not as plentiful as they once were , but that makes it an altogether more satisfying pursuit . However , there are strict rules and guidelines that must be observed if you want to be become a committed vinyl enthusiast , as follows . <h> Related Articles <p> With vinyl you ca n't just type a few words into a search box and almost immediately experience the results . Vinyl is not for those seeking instant gratification : it involves a physical transaction , so nine times out of ten you might even have to venture out of the house . This means there 's going to be jeopardy all around you . Perhaps the record you 're looking for wo n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , in a number of different places . Given the fact that you are probably looking for an unpopular album ( and not the new One Direction release ) , on a relatively unpopular format , and that the days of record shops on every high street are long gone , you could be pounding the pavement for some time . Vinyl enthusiasts need the patience of a JR Hartley , the eyes of an eagle , and possibly the stamina of an Ironman athlete . Stay strong . Nothing beats the moment when you find what you were looking for . <p> Do your homework <p> Unlike the new new wave of vinyl fans , I started getting into music long before the internet was invented . Back in those days if pop was n't your bag you 'd have to home-school yourself by scouring the music press and obscure fanzines , or examining the sleevenotes of albums to find out who the best producers were . I even used to read stock lists from specialist records shops . You need that kind of dedication with vinyl . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can now find most of your information using zany robotronic tools like " the web " . Which is sort of cheating , but let 's not make things harder than they need to be . <p> Always listen to the WHOLE record <p> Digital music has done its level best to murder the long player as a viable artform . Why buy 12 tracks when you can download tracks three and seven only ? After all , they were the catchiest when you previewed the album on iTunes . Records -- real , physical ones - demand that you listen to albums from start to finish . They remind you that most records by artists worth their salt have some sort of narrative structure to them , requiring concentration and an attention span , rather than an itchy fast-forward finger and the brain of an impatient goldfish . With vinyl , even if you wanted to switch between tracks and artists all the time , you ca n't , because it 's such a hassle having to repeatedly change one record for another -- these things were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness for that . <p> Find YOUR record shop <p> Local record shops used to be intimidating places jammed with competitive music nerds trying to out-do one another , and for the most part not much has changed ( except that the shops themselves are fewer and farther between ) . People still argue about great songs , they still ca n't settle the great Phil Spector vs Motown Christmas Album debate , and there will always be a music Nazi stationed behind the counter whose main function is to frighten you into buying " important " experimental jazz records . But they 're also rich , entertaining and rewarding places - perfect for any vinyl novice willing to wile away the hours flicking through empty sleeves while listening to obscure sounds . And do n't worry , before long you 'll be a competitive music nerd just like the rest of the clientele . Find a shop to call your own and soon you 'll feel right at home . <p> Embrace the crackles <p> After years of overplaying , you 'll find that some of your favourite records develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise , but you will soon learn to love these small blemishes . They 're like the laughter lines that appear around a loved one 's eyes as they get older . They eventually just become part of the package , and if anything you 'll love them even more for it . It 's like having your own special version . <p> Make room for your collection <p> Besides the sound quality generally being better than on any other medium , another treat that comes with vinyl is the physicality of it , the lovely pictures , the gatefold sleeves , the amount of space the damn things take up . In a world where possessions have given way to digital files , vinyl records are tangible and tactile . They are mementos of a life well lived and money well spent , and they satisfy the senses . Comparing a vinyl album to a compressed MP3 file is like comparing Christmas dinner with astronaut food . Remember , this stuff is n't clutter , whatever anyone tells you . Think of it as an art installation that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife. )
