<h> Share <p> Efforts to curb the availability of child abuse images online should not be limited to the searchable web , as criminals are increasingly turning to P2P networks and the dark web to distribute content . <p> This week has seen a series of ISPs and web firms talk up the work they are doing to clamp down on the proliferation of child abuse images on the net . <p> Google announced plans to invest millions of pounds in this area , while Talk Talk , BT , Sky and Virgin Media committed to collectively invest ? 1 million over the next four years in tackling the problem . <p> The bulk of their activities seem to be centred on the eradication , tracking and blocking of child abuse images on the searchable web , <p> However , concerns have been raised that not enough is being done to clampdown on similar content being shared via P2P and anonymised web networks . <p> Speaking to IT Pro , Christian Berg , chief executive of NetClean , said criminals are likely to use these alternative networks more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the searchable web . <p> " You can not solve this problem simply by blocking http traffic . It is an important piece of the puzzle , but there are so many ways of sharing this material and http addresses are not the preferred method of distribution , " he explained . <p> " There 's definitely not enough being done to tackle these hidden networks , and I know there is a will by law enforcers to do more , but resources are tight . " <p> He also said it is easy to tell search engines , social networks and the ISP community they need to do more , but the issue is not quite as straight forward as that . <p> " People look at Google and the ISPs and say this is a problem of the internet and you 're a bit part of the internet , you have to fix it , " he explained . <p> " Obviously , the internet is being used to spread it , but child abuse is really not an internet problem . It 's a human one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to approach the issue have centred on URL blocking , but Berg questioned how effective a tool this is . <p> " It is usually employed to protect UK citizens from accidentally stumbling on illegal content , rather than track down criminals , he said . <p> " If you are into this material you do n't have to be very tech savvy to know how to circumnavigate it , " he added . <p> His company develops technologies and software that blocks and tracks the online spread of child abuse content , which is used by law enforcement agencies and enterprises . <p> " We sell our software to organisations that can scan their servers , their laptops and desktops for known child abuse images and videos , " he explained . <p> " We 're not talking about URLs , but actual files , which means we can find things on USB sticks too , and <p> " We then tell the organisation they need to do an investigation and notify the police , " he added .
