Michael Owen 's dream of Melbourne Cup glory is very much alive  Michael Owen 's dream of having a runner in the Emirates Melbourne Cup in on Nov 5 is very much alive despite his gritty stayer Brown Panther finishing only fifth in Wednesday 's Greene King Foundation Stakes over an inadequate mile-and-a-quarter trip at Goodwood .  And so serious is the ex-football star at getting involved in Australia 's showcase race , he is sending Brown Panther 's jockey Richard Kingscote to the important Turnbull Stakes meeting at Flemington , on Oct 5 , in an attempt to get first-hand experience of the track .  Trainer Tom Dascombe said : " I 'm happy enough with that run . You ca n't really complain when you run in a race you never planned for in the first place . He 'd had a setback before the Irish St Leger and we had to run here to make sure he was all right . "  Brown Panther is around 20-1 for the Melbourne Cup , but as far as Dascombe is concerned , " His setback was nothing serious , but it was enough to knock us off stride .  " He ran a temperature and was off his grub for 24 hours . He missed a couple of days and you ca n't go for a big race in those circumstances . But , he 's done well enough with this final run before going into quarantine .  " Richard has probably gone a bit too quick out in front , and we were trying to give 5lb to the winner , so all things considered , I was happy . He 'll go into quarantine here for two weeks and then fly down to Melbourne , all going well . "  As for Kingscote going on an early reconnaissance mission to Australia , Dascombe said : " It would be very useful if Richard could get rides at Flemington in early October . It is hard enough turning up to ride in the biggest race of your career without any previous experience of the track .  " One of our owners has contacts in Melbourne , so we as well . Richard knows the horse , he now has to learn what he can about the course , " he added .  Brown Panther first emerged as a likely prospect for Melbourne when winning the Goodwood Cup in August in which the homebred gave Owen his biggest success as an owner . He bred the five-year-old out of his mare Treble Heights , a Group winner trained for him by John Gosden .  The winner Grandeur is a smart performer in his own right and was getting his season back on track with this convincing success under Ryan Moore .  He put a disappointing effort in the Arlington Million last time behind him with this victory and trainer Jeremy Noseda has some ambitious targets for the autumn , including the Breeders ' Cup at Santa Anita in early November .  " I was very worried about the ground today but I wanted to get another run into him before he goes off to America again , " said Noseda .  " He has a few options out there and I will have to speak Anita , but there are horses like The Fugue going there so we 'll have to see . It will depend if we decide to be brave . "  The Mark Johnston-trained Double Bluff looks to have a bright future after running out a convincing winner of the nine furlong two-year-old maiden .
