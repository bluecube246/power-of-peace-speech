Chelsea 's Eden Hazard : ' I hope to become one of the best like Ronaldo and Messi '  Eden Hazard says he aspires to be as good as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi one day .  The Chelsea winger told the Mail on Sunday : " I hope to become one of the best as that 's what people want to see , like Cristiano Ronaldo , like Messi , scoring goals .  " But that 's not what I am at the moment . I am who I am , with my strengths and weaknesses . It 's up to me to work on the weaknesses I have to improve further .  " I still have a lot of work to do -- but when I 'm enjoying it on the pitch , that 's when I 'm good . "  The attacker , who has 15 Premier League assists since Aug 2012 , with only Gerrard and Rooney registering as many in the same period , also admitted Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is not slow in reminding creative players " That 's normal because that 's his job and if we 're bad , he says so . "  " Sometimes we 're a bit scared of him - but he 's a very sincere manager and is very clear about what he wants . "  Hazard who the Blues signed from Lille in 2012 for ? 35m continued : " It 's not exactly that we 're scared of him .  " It 's just that he 's very clear about what he says and sometimes that can be a little bit shocking .  " But we 're all professional footballers and we 're used to criticism , so it 's up to us to make him happy . "  Chelsea currently sit in fourth place with 33 points , three behind league leaders Liverpool .
