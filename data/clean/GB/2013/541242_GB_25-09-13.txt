<h> Sherlock : The adventure of the expanding fandom <p> The wait is on ! ( Picture : PBS-Hartswood Films for the BBC , Colin Hutton ) <p> Sherlock was a show that originally slipped quietly under everybody 's radar whilst being made . It 's probable the cast and crew look fondly back on the pilot episode ( 2009 ) and the entire first series that followed in 2010 -- for the simple reason that they were created in relative anonymity , free of any pressure or expectations . <p> While both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman already had loyal fan bases after the first airing of Sherlock ( in late July 2010 ) , it 's fair to say that they both suddenly became far more visible in the public 's eye . <p> By the time production rolled around on series two , the first series had been sold to many overseas territories and the international fan base of the show had truly been established . Sherlockology came into existence a week before series two began filming ( in May 2011 ) and enthusiastically followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to visit the location of ' Faker Street ' ( AKA North Gower Street ) in North London while filming was underway . <p> By that point it was clear to the production team that they 'd created something special , attracting a lot of attention from a dedicated group of onlookers from the pavement opposite . Yet even then the crowds were manageable and we were stood with almost nobody around us ( at times ) and were struck by the oddity of seeing an actor disappear and a character you 've seen on television appear before your very eyes . <p> Sherlock has evolved into a show laden with massive expectation . <p> Cut to April 2013 , nearly two years later , and fans are lined six-deep on the pavement . Orange safety barriers pin them in away from the moving traffic in the road , while the crew stop to take pictures of the assembled crowd . Sherlock 's producer , Sue Vertue , also requested that fans not post photos that may reveal major spoilers online via a message on our website . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically in another street ) , stood on a step looking diagonally at the front door that is dressed as that of 221B . A black Jag with tinted windows rolls around the corner and pauses outside the door . Out steps Benedict Cumberbatch in full costume as Sherlock Holmes . Cue the thunderous , titanic screams . With a visible smile on his face , he waves to the mass of fans that have come to see him transform into the Great Detective . <p> It 's fair to say that in these last three years everything has changed . Not just for Benedict or Martin ( who has of course not just gone from ' Tim from the Office ' to John Watson but also Bilbo Baggins ) , but the entire process of producing the series itself has changed . Sherlock has evolved into a show laden with massive expectation . <p> With THAT ingenious series two cliffhanger festering in the minds of the now gigantic worldwide fan base ( it 's been almost two years ) , the best thing is that it 's very nearly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Metro Blogs is a place for opinions .
