forces widows face ' moral penalty ' of lost pensions  image caption the national memorial arboretum in staffordshire honours members of the armed forces killed on duty . currently , spouses of those who die off duty lose pension benefits if they remarry or cohabit with a new partner .  campaigners have called on ministers to change rules that mean 80 service widows a year have their pensions taken away .  currently , if a member of the armed forces dies while off duty , the ministry of defence makes their widow give up their spouse 's pension if they remarry or cohabit .  the rule has been in place since 1973 .  bbc news website readers have been sharing their views on the issue .  patricia crabtree , sleaford , lincolnshire  image caption patricia crabtree with her first husband , warrant officer gb wallis , and with her second husband , peter crabtree . she says : " i think the changes would be one of the best things to happen . "  my first husband was warrant over 30 years and died in april 1992 .  i was left with four teenage sons to bring up and initially i was awarded the basic raf pension .  i spoke to a member of the british legion telling them that my husband had died as a result of a misdiagnosis of cancer when he left the service .  he took premature voluntary release after returning home .  the british legion took up my case with the mod and i was subsequently awarded a war widow 's pension .  i remarried in 1999 and had not realised that i would lose my pension . so when the mod contacted me to return the pension payments made since my remarriage it caused me and my new husband some financial stress .  i now only get about ? 300 per month pension at the age of 71 .  i think the changes would be one of the best things to happen .  they would be recognition of all the work that ex-servicemen and their wives do . having a spouse in the forces means a 30 years of his life to service for his country and it seems rather bad that in return all his family gets is ? 300 per month .  image caption malcolm halliwell with his wife , sheila : " i always believed that there would be something to look after my wife when i die . "  malcolm halliwell , ramsey , cambridgeshire  i served 40 years in the raf and , until i read this article , i did not know that my wife could end up in this situation were anything to happen to me .  i feel genuinely aggrieved that one of the real benefits of my lifetime of service - my pension - does not have the survivor benefits that i had expected .  the fact that my wife might have to face the choice between losing her financial independence or loneliness in later life is shocking .  i left the raf in 2008 and had served since i was a boy apprentice in 1969 , so i 'd built up the maximum possible pension entitlement .  i always believed when i die .  what a terrible choice to have to make , between money or a new loving relationship - it is mean and archaic of the mod .  it is a moral penalty and it needs to be addressed .  i hope that the government listens to this lobby .  amanda oliver , worcester  image caption amanda oliver : " how unfair to pay into a scheme for 26 years and then have to make a choice between a secure financial future or a life as a complete family in a loving relationship . "  both my husband and i served in the british army , he for 26 years . i left after nine years to start a new career and have children .  my husband retired in about 1995 after being commissioned from the ranks in a very successful career .  in 2001 he died at the age of 49 from a brain tumour , just six months after diagnosis . our two daughters were six and 11 and i was just 40 years old .  fortunately we very senior position at work and take some time out to dedicate to the children .  two years later i met my now husband of 10 years and , after a year of dating , we moved in together .  this meant that i lost both my army and government pension , and my new husband had to take on the brunt of our finances while i looked for a new job and returned to the workplace .  he had a family from a previous relationship , so until i could find work he was supporting his family and mine .  during the six months of my husband 's terminal illness , one thing that helped through the madness was the knowledge that the 26 years of paying into his pension would ensure our financial security once he had died .  how unfair to pay into a scheme for 26 years and then have to make a choice between a secure financial future or a life as a complete family in a loving relationship .  when i informed the pension personnel of my changed state was true love as i was giving up a lot of money , around ? 1,500 to ? 2,000 per month .  i said then that i was sure i was making the right choice , but why have that choice forced on me ?
