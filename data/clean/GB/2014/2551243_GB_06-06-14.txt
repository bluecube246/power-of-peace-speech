Dido Belle: Britain's first black aristocrat
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10863078/Dido-Belle-Britains-first-black-aristocrat.html

<h> Dido Elizabeth Belle , the illegitimate , mixed race daughter of an 18th-century naval captain and subject of a new film , was a Lady like no other , discovers Nisha Lilia Diu <p> The amazing thing about Dido Elizabeth Belle is not that she was mixed-race . Who knows how many white men 's children were born to black slave women in the 18th century ? It 's not even that her father was a wealthy English aristocrat -- there were plenty of titled captains tearing around the Caribbean at that time , capturing French and Dutch schooners during the Seven Years ' War and making off with their sugar , coffee and other ( often human ) cargo . The extraordinary thing about Dido Belle is that her father , a 24-year-old Navy officer called John Lindsay , took her home to England and asked his extended family to raise her . And they did . They did it in some style , too . <p> Belle grew up in Kenwood House in north London . It was the palatial weekend retreat of Lindsay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscaped gardens with a view of St Paul 's Cathedral six miles away . Mansfield was Lord Chief Justice , and he made a number of landmark rulings on slavery that were among Britain 's first steps towards abolition . Did Belle 's presence in his home have anything to do with it ? Plenty of his contemporaries thought so , and they did n't admire him for it . <p> " Dido was very , very privileged , " says William Murray , a descendant of the earl and the son of the heir apparent . " She was in the top 5 per cent , perhaps the top 1 per cent , in terms of how she lived , her allowance , her dress , her education . " But Belle 's position was far from clear-cut . <p> At Kenwood , says Murray , " she was treated like the rest of the family -- when it was just the family . Where it got awkward is when they had guests in , " he says . The black , illegitimate daughter of a nobleman occupied a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving classes but too different to be wholly welcome in high society . When the Mansfields were entertaining , Belle did n't eat with their guests . <p> All of this makes Belle , the forthcoming film about Dido 's life from the Bafta-winning director Amma Asante , one of the most unusual costume dramas to hit the big screen . The fabulous gowns , eligible young men and barely suppressed class anxieties of London 's social " season " are all present and correct . But other , rarely registered aspects of Jane Austen 's England are at the centre of the frame : the uncomfortable knowledge of where the fragrant leaves and sculpted sugar loaves at the ladies ' tea parties have come from ; and , in Belle ( played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw , who was Ophelia opposite Jude Law 's Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse in 2009 ) , the evidence of what their men got up to when they were far away at sea or on the plantations . <h> Related Articles <p> We tend to think of mixed-race children as a modern phenomenon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman times . There were around 10,000 black people in the city , and many more of mixed parentage by the time Belle was born in 1761 . Lindsay seems to have met Belle 's mother , a slave named Maria , on a captured ship in the West Indies . He was a young bachelor , but already much-feted by the newspapers back home for his exploits . <p> Their story is recounted in the diaries of Thomas Hutchinson , a former governor of Massachusetts who attended a dinner party at Kenwood in August 1779 . He met Belle during his visit , who was about 18 at the time . " A Black came in after dinner and sat with the ladies , " he writes , " and after coffee , walked with the company in the gardens , one of the young ladies having her arm within the other . She had a very high cap and her wool was much frizzled in her neck , but not enough to answer the large curls now in fashion . She is neither handsome nor genteel -- pert enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continues , " but My Lord mentioned it again . Sir John Lindsay having taken her mother prisoner in a Spanish vessel , brought her to England where she was delivered of this girl , and which was taken care of by Lord M. , and has been educated by his family . He calls her Dido , which I suppose is all the name she has . <p> " He knows he has been reproached for showing fondness for her , " Hutchinson observes , going on to recall one of Mansfield 's cases . " A few years ago there was a cause before his Lordship brought by a Black for recovery of his liberty . A Jamaica planter , being asked what judgment his Lordship would give answered ' No doubt ... he will be set free , for Lord Mansfield keeps a Black in his house which governs him and the whole family . ' " <p> The case was that of James Somerset . A slave who had been brought to England , Somerset escaped , was caught and then forced onto a ship bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued he could do with him as he pleased . But witnesses were shocked by Somerset 's violent capture and commentators horrified that a man 's freedom could be denied on English soil . Mansfield ( played in the film by Tom Wilkinson ) set him free , judging that colony slave laws were not binding in England . " The state of slavery is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it , " he said . <p> Lord Mansfield is played by Tom Wilkinson <p> Dido Belle was n't the only child in the Mansfields ' care . They were also bringing up Elizabeth Murray , the daughter of their nephew Lord Stormont , whose wife had died when Elizabeth was six . The two girls appear in a double portrait that once hung at Kenwood and is now at Scone Palace , Lord Mansfield 's ancestral home in Scotland . It was this portrait that piqued the curiosity of Misan Sagay , Belle 's scriptwriter , and started the decade-long process of getting the film made . " I was amazed to see this black girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the painting was later shown to Amma Asante she had a similar reaction . " For centuries , black people were basically accessories in paintings , there to express the status of the white people , " says Asante . " We were never looking out at the painter but up in awe at the white protagonist . I knew this was something very different . " Esther Chadwick , a member of the History of Art department at Yale University , agrees . " What 's remarkable is that Dido is painted at the same height as Elizabeth Murray , and Elizabeth Murray is shown reaching out to her . But what 's most unusual is her direct gaze . " <p> Kenwood 's accounts show Belle was on an almost-equal footing with Elizabeth . She had a four-poster bed draped in chintz , mahogany furniture in her rooms and costly remedies , purchased when she was ill . She received an allowance of ? 30 a year -- twice the annual salary of the first coachman , but far less than Elizabeth 's ? 100 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seems to have enjoyed a close relationship with her adoptive guardian . Hutchinson recollects that " she was called upon by my Lord every minute for this thing and that , and shewed the greatest attention to everything he said " . Mansfield sometimes dictated letters to Belle ( who had beautiful handwriting ) so it 's entirely possible she would have been aware of his cases . One of these was the Zong insurance claim , which forms the centrepiece of the film . <p> In 1781 , a slave ship bound for Jamaica threw 132 slaves overboard . The ship 's owners claimed the vessel had run out of water and the crew had to sacrifice some slaves to save the 300 others on board . Now , they wanted their insurers to pay up for the lost " cargo " . The insurance company rejected the claim and it found its way to Lord Mansfield . <p> " It is a very shocking case , " he wrote . It appalled English society . The legal argument hinged on whether the slaves had been killed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become diseased during the journey - and therefore worthless - and had been murdered for the insurance payout . In the end , the owners could n't prove necessity and dropped the claim amid a storm of negative publicity . In the film , Belle experiences a political awakening during the trial and becomes involved in the fight against the ship 's owners . Whether or not this happened , how must she have felt -- and how must Mansfield have felt -- knowing that her own mother had been a slave and that she , too , could easily have met the same fate ? <p> The portrait of Dido Belle and Lady Elizabeth Murray is on show at Scone Palace , Scotland <p> For a long time , the double portrait at Scone Palace was labelled with only one name : " the Lady Elizabeth Murray " . As William Murray explains , " It was only when my grandmother was taking some tourists around Scone in the early Nineties that one of them who had heard of Dido questioned who was in this portrait . " The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stringfield , an archaeologist at the University of West Florida , was simultaneously digging the site of the house of one Maria Belle . Her work has only just become known to the Murray family and to British researchers . Stringfield found , among other things , a document , signed by Sir John Lindsay , deeding a lot in Pensacola , Florida , to Maria in 1772 . " It was such an unusual situation , " she tells me . " You would not normally have men conveying property to an ex-slave . " <p> In 1764 , when Dido was three , Lindsay was sent to Pensacola to test naval equipment . Maria Belle probably accompanied him and this is when Dido most likely passed into the Mansfields ' care . " It was not unusual for men in frontier settings to have women with them that were not their wives , " says Stringfield . <p> Once in Florida , Lindsay took his pick of land that had been granted to the British Navy . " The British named the streets after men of importance and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maria Belle 's former house is on the corner of Lindsay and Mansfield streets . Lindsay and Maria returned to London in subsequent years and their relationship continued well into Lindsay 's 1768 marriage to Mary Milner , an MP 's daughter . But it appears to have ended in 1774 , when Maria returned to Pensacola alone . <p> In the deed for the house , Lindsay guaranteed Maria her freedom , and , from Stringfield 's excavations of the site , it looks like he set her up well . Stringfield has found china tea pots and cups , " a beautiful decanter top " and pieces of delicate wine glass . " It was certainly a genteel life , " she says . <p> Frontier society was relaxed , says Stringfield , and Maria " probably had women friends in a similar situation to herself here . " Life at Kenwood could n't have been more different . The Mansfields would have been keenly aware of the furore Dido 's presence in their home caused . In Belle they 're less than delighted when Lindsay turns up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says an astonished Lady Mansfield ( played by Emily Watson ) . " She is my blood , " he replies . <p> " So why did the first Earl take her on ? " asks William Murray . " I think it 's because of his own experience of being an outsider . " Mansfield grew up in Scotland , the fourth son of the Viscount of Stormont . It was a noble but impoverished line and Mansfield was dispatched to London aged 12 to make his own way . <p> Lord Mansfield died in 1793 , aged 87 , and Belle married five months later . He left Belle an inheritance and an annuity of ? 100 for life . In his will he wrote , " I assert to Dido her freedom . " Mansfield 's sister ( played by Penelope Wilton in the film ) also left her money as did Sir John Lindsay . He had no children with his wife but his will mentions a second illegitimate child , John . Maria Belle 's son ? Who knows . <p> Little is known about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a law student in " Belle " but a steward in real life , and the son of the local Reverend in Hampstead . According to Murray , they had known each other , at least by sight , for many years . They moved to what is now Ebury Street in Belgravia and had three children , one of whom joined the East India Company . Belle died of natural causes aged 41 and was buried in the St George 's , Hanover Square , overspill burial ground on Bayswater Road . That was cleared to make way for the redevelopment of the Bayswater area in the Seventies . Nobody 's quite sure where she is now . <p> ' Belle ' is released on June 13 . The portrait of Belle and Elizabeth Murray is on display at Scone Palace as part of ' Dido -- Her Story ' , until October 31 ; www.scone-palace.co.uk
