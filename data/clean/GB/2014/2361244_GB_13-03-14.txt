intel corp . has decided to speed up introduction of its next-generation microprocessors and platforms designed for enthusiasts who demand maximum performance . the new core i7 extreme " haswell-e " chips along with intel x99-based mainboards will be introduced at computex taipei 2014 in early june , several months before planned originally , according to sources with knowledge of intel 's plans .  intel 's " haswell-e " central processing unit will be intel 's first desktop processor to feature up to eight cores based on the haswell micro-architecture with hyper-threading technology . the new chips will integrate 20mb of l3 cache , quad-channel ddr4 memory controller ( 2133mhz maximum clock-speed , up to one dimm per channel ) , turbo boost 2 technology as well as 40 integrated pci express 3.0 lanes . the processor is made using 22nm process technology .  the new core i7 " haswell-e " 5000-series central processing units will be compatible with intel x99 chipset as well as lga2011-3 socket . the platform will be tailored for enthusiasts , so it will support very flexible tuning and overclocking x8 mode ( four graphics cards and one enthusiast-class solid-state drive in pcie card form-factor ) , ten serial ata-6gb/s ports , up to six usb 3.0 ports ( 14 usb ports in total ) , various intel technologies like rapid storage , rapid recover and so on .  previously it was believed that intel will introduce the core i7 " haswell-e " 5000-series cpus in the third quarter of 2014 , in august or september . however , it looks like the company decided to speed up the things quite a bit : the new high-end desktop ( hedt ) platform from intel will be unveiled at computex taipei 2013 trade-show and will reach the market shortly after that .  the launch of the core i7 " haswell-e " microprocessor and intel x99 " wellsburg " core-logic will have a major influence on the market of pc hardware . in particular , makers of motherboards will introduce all-new mainboards based on the latest chipset and feature a bunch of innovations , such as new overclocking and tuning capabilities , thunderbolt 2.0 , 802.11ac wi-fi , advanced integrated audio to roll-out their ddr4 memory sticks earlier than expected . developers of cooling systems will also likely launch their new products in mid-2014 . finally , boutique pc makers will also have to unveil new systems featuring the new hedt platform . intel did not comment on the news-story .  kitguru says : given that the market of pcs remain to be slow , it is surprising to see intel pulling-in hedt introduction by a quarter . while the new flagship core i7-5960x " haswell-e " microprocessor will be rather unique , it will aimed at only a fraction of the market and will hardly bring a lot of revenue to the chip giant . perhaps , intel is shifting its attitude towards desktops in general ?  intel pulls-in launch of core i7 extreme ' haswell-e ' 5000 to q2 , 4.9 out of 5 based on 18 ratings  they certainly needed to move this up . ivy bridge-e was a massive disappointment -- 2012 's cpu technology coupled to 2011 's chipset -- and all for a premium price tag . what on earth was intel thinking not hand-me-downs from the high-end desktop market .  at this point , i 'm not even sure that waiting for an expensive haswell-e system was even a good idea . sure eight cores are impressive but what 's the cost ? and only a few types of applications will benefit -- anything an 8-core processor does noticably better will still be a waiting game for the user , less waiting , but still waiting . an now , many of those applications are starting to be implemented on the gpu with even better results .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : +1 ( from 1 vote )  http : //www.tuskembedded.com aaronk  8 cores is impressive but curious to see how the high-end race plays . working on the embedded side of things i 've noticed a slow down in the race for the top with much more of the emphasis being placed on low-power , size and weight . for embedded applications that require high-end processing like eric states above , we 're starting to see these implemented on the gpu .  va:f 1.9.221171  rating : for god 's sake release it already . i have been waiting to upgrade my x58 and just trying to find a reason , and here is it . and do n't be too greedy , that 's the big part : /  well when it comes out i 'll be upgrading my main / server machine from i7-2600k with 16gb ddr3 to i7-5960x expensive mb and 32gb of 2133mhz ddr4 when it 's out . games box already has an i7-3930k etc. so it 's fine
