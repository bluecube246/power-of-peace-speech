<h> Advertisement <h> Festive jumpers and presents stuck on top of buildings -- Christmas day in the life of a police call handler <p> If you need to call 999 on Christmas Day , one of the voices you might hear is that of Steve Marshall , a team leader in South Yorkshire Police 's call handling department . <p> Steve Marshall will be taking 999 calls on Christmas day Credit : South Yorkshire Police <p> Just as thousands of us are tucking into turkey sandwiches , or even having a snooze on the settee after one too many mince pies , Steve will be setting off for his night shift . <p> Steve retired as a police constable in 2004 and came back in a civilian role . This is his first Christmas Day working since he retired as an officer . <p> Steve said : " As an officer , I caught a few drink drivers on Christmas Day and a few people speeding to get to in-laws in time . <p> " A lot of the more ridiculous calls that come into the call handlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a different experience dealing with calls and hopefully resolving them . <p> " Call Handlers are the first point of contact with the public and on occasions , you feel on the front line as much as some officers . " . <p> " I 've not had a frozen turkey call but it could happen yet . I 'm hoping PC Rain is on duty -- he always helps to keep it quiet . " <p> As a team leader , Steve and other supervisors will be putting on a pie and pea supper for his team and there will also be the obligatory Christmas jumper . <p> Steve and his family will be celebrating Christmas on another day as two of his sons are also working . <p> He added : " There 'll be no Christmas dinner for me as I 'm working Christmas Eve as well but we will make up for it as a family on another day . " <p> Another team leader who has spent the last five Christmas Days at work is Claire Nugent . <p> Although Claire has been lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , she remembers one particular call from Christmas Day . <p> " Every scenario you can imagine , someone will have called police about it . <p> " The most ridiculous Christmas call I took was a woman who said there had been a helicopter crash . <p> " However , when I started asking questions she said it was her son 's toy helicopter and it had landed on top of a shop and was stuck . <p> " I was relieved but could n't believe she thought she should call police about it . " <p> Claire said although there 's no Christmas dinner in the office the team do normally have bacon sandwiches to get in the festive spirit . <p> She added : " There 's always a good atmosphere in here on Christmas Day , we all work together and help each other out . <p> " You have had mega busy shifts in the run up to Christmas so it is usually a bit quieter on the day -- although it 's unpredictable . <p> " The weather has a huge effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can guarantee more calls . <p> " I think people who do n't work shifts can often take it for granted spending Christmas Day with their family . <p> " We make the choice to work in a job that requires us to work over the festive period but I would still like to be at home with my family for Christmas so I will be making the most of being off this year .
