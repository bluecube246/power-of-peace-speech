advertisement  festive jumpers and presents stuck on top of buildings -- christmas day in the life of a police call handler  if you need to call 999 on christmas day , one of the voices you might hear is that of steve marshall , a team leader in south yorkshire police 's call handling department .  steve marshall will be taking 999 calls on christmas day credit : south yorkshire police  just as thousands of us are tucking into turkey sandwiches , or even having a snooze on the settee after one too many mince pies , steve will be setting off for his night shift .  steve retired as a police constable in 2004 and came back in a civilian role . this is his first christmas day working since he retired as an officer .  steve said : " as an officer , i caught a few drink drivers on christmas day and a few people speeding to get to in-laws in time .  " a lot of the more ridiculous calls that come into the call handlers will be a different experience dealing with calls and hopefully resolving them .  " call handlers are the first point of contact with the public and on occasions , you feel on the front line as much as some officers . " .  " i 've not had a frozen turkey call but it could happen yet . i 'm hoping pc rain is on duty -- he always helps to keep it quiet . "  as a team leader , steve and other supervisors will be putting on a pie and pea supper for his team and there will also be the obligatory christmas jumper .  steve and his family will be celebrating christmas on another day as two of his sons are also working .  he added : " there 'll be no christmas dinner for me as i 'm working christmas eve as well but we will make up for it as a family on another day . "  another team leader who has spent the last five christmas days at work is claire nugent .  although claire has been lucky children , she remembers one particular call from christmas day .  " every scenario you can imagine , someone will have called police about it .  " the most ridiculous christmas call i took was a woman who said there had been a helicopter crash .  " however , when i started asking questions she said it was her son 's toy helicopter and it had landed on top of a shop and was stuck .  " i was relieved but could n't believe she thought she should call police about it . "  claire said although there 's no christmas dinner in the office the team do normally have bacon sandwiches to get in the festive spirit .  she added : " there 's always a good atmosphere in here on christmas day , we all work together and help each other out .  " you have had mega busy shifts in the run up to christmas so it is usually a bit quieter on the day -- although it 's unpredictable .  " the weather has a huge effect on the you can guarantee more calls .  " i think people who do n't work shifts can often take it for granted spending christmas day with their family .  " we make the choice to work in a job that requires us to work over the festive period but i would still like to be at home with my family for christmas so i will be making the most of being off this year .
