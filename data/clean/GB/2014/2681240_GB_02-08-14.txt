<h> Save the tiger : Learning to live with dangerous neighbours <p> Another person is lost to the Royal Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans mangrove forests , straddling India and Bangladesh , almost every month . It is the only region in the world where humans are routinely killed by wild cats . <p> " Two more men were killed last month -- one on the 11th of July and the other on the 26th . In both cases , they went very close to the jungle to fish and a tiger attacked and killed them , " says Anil Mistry , 48 , a resident of the village of Bali , in the Indian portion of the Sundarbans . " It 's not uncommon for people to be killed on the river but more often it happens when they venture deep into the forest to collect firewood , crabs or honey . " <p> Joseph Vattakaven , of WWF-India , says : " The Sundarbans is a unique habitat that 's very harsh for tigers and people . These conditions leave the tigers very little prey -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else in the world they prey on human beings . " <p> Nobody knows how many people have died in the hundreds of villages that lie scattered across the Sundarbans , a maze of swamp , islands and mangrove forests described by Amitav Ghosh , in his novel The Hungry Tide , as " the trailing threads of India 's fabric , the ragged fringe of her sari " . <p> Official estimates are sketchy and are generally thought to greatly underestimate the reality because so many of those killed simply go missing . Often the victims are there illegally and relatives fear a fine or the loss of their fishing permit . <p> An unsuccessful scheme to scare off the animals with masks <p> In recent years , tigers and humans have been increasingly thrown together , as climate change combines with years of forest subsistence to put resources under increasing pressure . Fish catches are declining , rivers are silting up , cyclones are becoming more frequent and intense , while rising sea levels result in less fresh water , more floods and faster rates of erosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundarbans are more aggressive than elsewhere because the water in this coastal area is more salty , putting them in a state of discomfort -- but most experts believe this to be a myth . <p> Meanwhile , dwindling resources are forcing communities to go deeper into the " core " of the forests to collect honey , fish , shrimps , crabs and wood for their boats and homes . This makes them more vulnerable to tiger attacks , while the tigers are forced to come out of the forest because they are finding less prey . <p> Belinda Wright , a tiger conservationist and founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India , who also lives in Bali village , says : " You ca n't walk through the forest . You have to crawl -- human beings become four-legged animals and so the tigers treat you like one of their prey . Over the years people have become completely dependent on the mangrove . This is one of the most impoverished areas in India ; there are no roads , no electricity , and only minimal health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat humans , Mr Vattakaven says , and because they are so deep in the forest no one can see them and the tides take away the remains . <p> " The tigers have had a massive impact on villagers ' lives . Just to know that after darkness you could get killed -- that changes the mindscape , " he adds . " It 's always there in the background . Whenever someone goes to fish or collect honey they stage an elaborate farewell because it might be their last trip . People pray for their safety . <p> " Everyone knows someone who has been killed by a tiger -- every village has lost at least one person . And on top of the deaths there are many that have been marked , bitten , scratched -- it is common for people to show their wounds . " <p> Despite the trauma inflicted on the victims and their families , many insist that they do not hate the animals . Instead , they are seen as the forest 's protector , especially against the threat of logging . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save the Tiger <h> 1/9 Save the Tiger <p> Evgeny Lebedev , second left , with rangers from the regional government 's anti-poaching initiative <h> 2/9 Save the Tiger <p> A Siberian tiger stands on a hill in the Hengdaohezi Breeding Center for Felidae in Harbin of Heilongjiang Province , China .

She remembers meeting the father of Rupali Bowlia , a 14-year-old schoolgirl who was attacked and killed by a tiger in 2004 as she sat behind her family 's mud house doing her homework . <p> " A couple of years later I was astonished to see her father , Bimal Bowlia , attending one of our gatherings to celebrate wildlife week . He told me : ' We need to understand and respect what 's out there -- the sky , the jungle , and even the tiger -- if we are to prosper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong sense among those in the Sundarbans that the death-toll has fallen significantly this decade , at least in the Indian quarter . Mr Vattakaven puts this down to an ongoing project to build nylon fences around the forest to contain the tigers , and tightening restrictions on people going deep into the forest . <p> Other measures have been tried with less success , he says , including electrified " human " dummies on boats . The idea was that the tiger would attack , get an electric shock and associate that feeling with humans , making them less likely to strike again . <p> A male Bengal tiger is released deep in the forest after wandering too close to villages <p> " I 'm not sure that one worked , " says Mr Vattakaven . " But the nylon fences and increased restrictions on entering the forest are helping bring down numbers . The fence is primarily meant to keep tigers in the forest but it also acts as a physical and psychological barrier to people going in . " <p> But there is still much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a significant deterrent for tigers who much prefer the dark -- and more fences need to be built . There also needs to be more enforcement of laws preventing people going into the forest core and an increase in people patrolling the perimeter , adds Mr Vattakaven . <p> Most difficult of all , people need to be made less dependent on the forest . New jobs need to be created , for example by developing tourism in the area , he says . But he insists that for most , moving away from the Sundarbans is n't an option . <p> " When you 've been born with the idea that tigers are there you get used to a certain life . People love the place . It 's a unique habitat and rich in culture . People are very passionate about the area so they would n't move unless they had to , " he says . <h> How to help : <p> This is a charity donation service .
