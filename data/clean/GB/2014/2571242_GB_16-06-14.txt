<p> Economic analysis can help policymakers gauge how much action it 's worth taking to tackle future climate change . But some economic models have been criticised for failing to account for the findings of the latest climate science -- resulting , critics say , in significant blind spots . <p> Prominent climate economist , Lord Stern , is one of those critics . He 's previously warned that models " grossly underestimate " the risks of climate change , and consequently the cost of failing to act . <p> In a new paper due to be published in The Economic Journal and released by LSE today , Stern and co-author Dr Simon Dietz try to redress the balance . They suggest informing models with the latest research strengthens the case for stringent action to tackle climate change . <p> Estimating costs <p> There are a number of models that try to work out how much economic damage climate change will cause in the future , and how much we should pay now to avoid that . <p> But the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPCC uses multiple ' integrated assessment models ' ( IAMs ) to estimate the future cost of climate change . The models estimate changes in temperature and economic conditions based on future emissions . They then calculate how much additional damage is caused by emitting an extra tonne of carbon dioxide today . <p> That cost is known as the social cost of carbon and is expressed in dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide -- a carbon price , effectively . <p> But the information you get out of models in only as good as the information you put in . Professor Chris Field , co-chair of one of the groups that wrote the IPCC report , has previously said the numbers produced by economic models are " old fashioned " when you consider " the modern science " . <p> What does that mean ? It implies that economic models do n't capture all the potential impacts of climate change . That means they produce low social cost of carbon estimates , and underestimate the risk of failing to take action to tackle climate change . <p> Updating models <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate insights from recent climate science into one prominent model -- the dynamic integrated climate-economy ( DICE ) model developed by Yale Professor Bill Nordhaus . The thinking goes that by updating what they describe as the models " unrealistic " assumptions , the results should become more useful . <p> For example , recent research suggests climate change could seriously damage some countries ' infrastructure or cause certain assets ( such as coastal power stations ) to be abandoned . That could have a big impact on economic productivity , and so Stern and Dietz include this in the model . <p> They also adjust the model 's climate sensitivity input -- the impact of doubling the concentration of greenhouse gases on global temperatures . The standard DICE model only looks at the economic impact of around three degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels . Stern and Dietz make it consider a range from 1.5 to six degrees . <p> Finally , they adjust the temperature threshold at which the model assumes large economic losses occur . The standard DICE model suggests an 18 degree rise in global average temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 50 per cent . But such warming would likely render the Earth uninhabitable for most species , including humans . The tweaked model allows such damage to occur at much lower levels of warming , to try and better reflect the likely real world impact of climate change . <p> The result of the updates -- perhaps unsurprisingly -- is that the reformed DICE model implies taking much stronger action than previously . The updated model finds that if policymakers are going to avoid warming of more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels , they should try to implement a carbon price of $32 to $103 today -- either through a carbon market or a tax . The price should rise to $82 to $260 in 2035 depending on how great the damage from climate change is expected to be . <p> Useful indication <p> The carbon prices need to be taken with a pinch of salt , however . It 's uncertain how much emissions could reduce as a result of implementing a stringent carbon price . That 's why most models -- including DICE -- give a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated to be . <p> Nonetheless , it 's notable is how the results differ to the model 's previous recommendation and current carbon prices . Even in a best case scenario , the updated model 's carbon price is considerably more than the $12 the standard model recommends . It 's also much more than current carbon prices . The EU 's carbon market currently has a price of around ? ? ? 6 ( $8 ) , and two US markets have prices of $2 to $15 . <p> So even if the updated price range does n't translate into a hard and fast policy recommendation , the discrepancy with current prices will support the argument that policymakers are n't doing enough to curb emissions .
