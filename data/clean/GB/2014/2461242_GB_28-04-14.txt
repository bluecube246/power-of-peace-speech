Mark Cavendish wins second successive stage of Tour of Turkey  Share via  Cavendish was forced to take more than a month off racing , due to illness Tim De Waele  Josh Burrows  Last updated at 3:27PM , April 28 2014  After missing a month of racing because of illness , Mark Cavendish has sprinted back into form with successive stage victories on the Tour of Turkey .  His victory today was achieved in a sprint finish similar to yesterday 's , with the British rider surging clear in the final few metres . Although the competition from other sprinters in the peloton is not world class - Cavendish 's biggest potential rival , Andre Greipel , is recovering from a shoulder injury and not contesting the sprints - the Manx rider will be pleased that the break from competition has not done major damage to his form .
