Poor Patna women volunteer to help ease traffic snarls  Women from underprivileged families have come to the rescue of harried commuters in Bihar to achieve what the Patna police have failed to do over the years .  They are regulating traffic in a smooth way in the most congested area in the city .  As many as 35 women associated with Garib Dusta , a voluntary organisation committed to the welfare of poor people in the state , have come forward to help police manage heavy traffic flow at Patna 's Sahib area where vehicles barely move during peak hours .  Patna 's group of women are coming to the rescue by helping traffic congestion improve  Dressed in blue saris , the ' Yatayat Sakhi ( Traffic buddy ) ' group has already had a positive impact on traffic as drivers have been following their directives ever since the women hit the streets on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr .  " Autorickshaw drivers believe these volunteers have been appointed by the traffic police , " said Ramji Yogesh , president of Garib after an ailing acquaintance got stuck in traffic and died on way to a hospital .  " We met senior officers of Patna police and volunteered to send members of our organisation to help them , " he said .  The women volunteers work in two shifts - 8am to 2am and 2pm to 8pm - to clear bottlenecks .
