<h> First Sports Personality of the Year and then X Factor : The people have spoken ... and they have n't got a clue <p> Ben Haenow is leading the Christmas number one race Syco/Thames/Corbis <p> After a weekend that brought the concept of democracy to its knees , I can no longer resist the urge to confess to this unsettling thought . If the will of the people is this wilfully obtuse , would n't we better off under a benign dictatorship ? <p> Curiously , such alarming speculation has nothing to do with the latest revelations about the political party to which we the people may gift the balance of power next May ( we will come to Ukip elsewhere ) . It was the pair of plebiscites declared within moments of one another on Sunday night . <h> READ MORE <p> Taking them in chronological order brings us first to the popular revolution which concluded another season of X Factor . If you missed the show , I congratulate you . If not , you will have witnessed a popular rebellion against Simon Cowell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cowell clearly intended , the people rewarded a pub and club singer , Ben Haenow , for bravely battling one of two undiagnosed disorders : either the misapprehension that growling every line is cool ( Ronan Keating Syndrome ) or chronic laryngitis . <p> Tempting as it is to applaud a coup d'etat against Cowell and his crude manipulation of the shrinking number of saddos like myself who still watch the stale karaoke-fest , the man who built One Direction out of five solo artist wannabes can discern the marginal talent of a Fleur from the grinding mediocrity of a Ben . <h> 15/31 X Factor 2014 <h> 16/31 X Factor 2014 <h> 17/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Finalist Andrea Faustini performs in a golden costume on the Halloween show <p> Splash News <h> 18/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Contestant Stevi Ritchie performs ' Music Of The Night ' from The Phantom of the Opera on the live X Factor Halloween show <p> Splash News <h> 19/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Finalist Lauren Platt performs ' Dark Horse ' on the Halloween special <p> Splash News <h> 20/31 X Factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform ' Monster Mash ' on the live Halloween show in London <p> Splash News <h> 21/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Lola Saunders performs ' Crazy ' on the live Halloween show <p> Syco/Thames/Corbis <h> 22/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Stereo Kicks perform together on stage during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 23/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Andrea Faustini performs on stage during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 24/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Fleur East performs during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 25/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Ben Haenow performs during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 26/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Lauren Platt performs on Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 27/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Only the Young mixed group performing on stage during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 28/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Jay James performing during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 29/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Paul Akister performs on Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <h> 30/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Lola Saunders seen performing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31/31 X Factor 2014 <p> Jack Walton performs during Movie Week <p> Splash News , Corbis <p> If the ITV1 electorate raised grave questions about the process of what qualifies in our culture as the most vibrant expressions of democratic will , BBC1 viewers who elected the Sports Personality of the Year award immediately answered them by absurdly plumping for Lewis Hamilton over Rory Mcllroy . <p> It is true , of course , that massively embarrassing picks were made before the vote was outsourced to the public a few years ago . We need n't belabour the legendary oxymoron whereby Nigel Mansell was twice awarded a title featuring the word " personality " . Yet in those two years , as in so many others , the choice was sufficiently limited ( if the crown green bowler David Bryant had worked out how to light his pipe , he would have won ) as to be no choice at all . <p> This year , once again , there should have been no real choice . Hamilton won a Formula 1 World Championship in which , with teammate Nico Rosberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the superiority of these cars that my late grandmother Bessie Norman , who celebrated a driving test pass at a precocious 77-years-old by driving into my grandfather 's knee , would have taken a clutch of pole positions and several chequered flags at the wheel of Hamilton 's Mercedes . <p> Lewis Hamilton becomes the first motor racing star to win the award since Damon Hill in 1996 <p> Where there are generally two potential champions in F1 , and at most five in a men 's grand slam tennis event , 40 or 50 golfers begin a major with a realistic chance . This is why winning one is the toughest challenge in individual sport . McIlroy brilliantly won two in succession , the Open and the US PGA . Having established himself as much the best player in the world and a live contender to join Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in golf 's holy trinity , he played his part in giving the Americans the Ryder Cup hiding they richly deserved . <p> In the generally undistinguished modern history of British sport , only Andy Murray ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a 12 months to rival McIlroy 's . The young man is a rampant genius where Hamilton is a very good and quick driver . But thanks to the obsession with pandering to the public voice ( the incessant recitation of tweets on radio shows ; the online message boards shrieking with semi-literate thuggery ) , a crestfallen McIlroy was robbed . <h> READ MORE <p> Motor sport fanatics are not only weirdo fantasists in the Clarkson mould , but compulsive phone voters . Even if such venerable followers of golf as Peter Alliss do master the technology of texting , the tendency to wear stringback driving gloves at all times would frustrate their best intentions . <p> These simultaneous miscarriages of justice make it unmistakably plain that the public , while we may safely be permitted the trivial political choices , can not be trusted with the serious stuff . <p> Whether from Cowell , a group of sports editors or whomever , decisions about the truly sacrosanct aspects of national life need the firm smack of dictatorship . GK Chesterton wrote that " We are the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then . We never stop speaking now , and from us an indefinite period of silence would be greatly appreciated .
