The biggest disappointments of 2014  We 've had enough of talking about everything that 's been good this year , now it 's time to focus on the things that have n't been so great .  As with every year , the last 12 months has seen some disappointments in the world of tech , with unfulfilled hopes and dashed dreams cropping up every now and then to keep us on our toes .  But do n't just take my word for it , here 's what our all-knowing writers thought were some of the biggest disappointments of 2014 .  No new cheap Nexus -- Jamie Hinks  As a Google Android phone owner , it would be very easy to reserve this section for Apple 's " groundbreaking " iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices that do much of what the likes of Samsung and HTC have been doing well for some time .  That 's too simple and nowhere near as disappointing as Google 's decision to stop bringing out low-priced Nexus smartphones with high-end specs and instead hit the In other years Google has released the Nexus 4 and 5 that have both been at the sub- ? 300 price point and the fact they are Google 's own smartphones meant that they were the first to receive Android updates .  Now the only option on the table is to buy last year 's Nexus 5 ( which is often out of stock ) or hit eBay .  The other choice for those of us that want one of the latest handsets with stock Android is to invest in the Motorola 's Moto X Pure Edition , which brings the Nexus 6 specs into a device without a phablet-sized screen .  Apple Watch at 12 O'Clock -- Darren Allen  The biggest disappointment for me this year was Apple 's " next big thing " , the Apple Watch , which was unveiled back in September .  I was expecting great things from Apple with this gadget . The firm 's iPad is on the slide , and we 've seen nothing truly new since , well , the iPad -- just new versions of iPhones the unveiling , my first impressions were that Apple 's smartwatch does n't look as attractive as I thought it might . I was expecting something truly breath-taking in the aesthetics department , with all the assembled ranks of fashion editors invited to the launch to goggle over this new creation .  And while it 's certainly not a bad looking piece of hardware , it 's a little chunkier than I anticipated , and I was really expecting something that looks sleeker on the wrist ( to truly capture that status symbol appeal ) .  But forget looks for the moment . What about features -- it 's those that are really important , right ? Well , the Apple Watch does n't exactly score on that point either .  What exactly does it do that other smartwatches do n't ? Uhh ... well ... umm , okay , so there 's a very smart looking UI system , and some neat trimmings -- but there are no killer features which make you sit up in your seat and pay attention .  Apparently Apple even recognises planning to add further sensors and more in-depth health features down the line , such as sleep or blood sugar monitoring . But this sort of thing should have been in the device from the get-go .  In fairness , there may be more revelations on the feature front next year as the launch nears , but do n't hold your breath for anything spectacular .  And there 's also the price . While nothing is confirmed , even the stainless steel version is likely to be very expensive going by reports ( let alone the gold watch , although we 'd expect the latter to be astronomical , naturally ) .  Is this really the device that will kick-start the smartwatch revolution next year , as many analysts seem to be predicting ? Not from where I 'm stood ...  But then , this is an Apple product , and that 's perhaps all it needs to be .  Amazon Fire fails to set the world alight -- Barclay Ballard  There was much hype in 2014 surrounding Amazon 's first foray into the smartphone the public 's imagination alight .  It 's hallmark characteristic , the " Dynamic Perspective , " which uses four front-facing cameras to give a pseudo-3D impression of depth , came across as more of a gimmick than a must-have feature .  While the handset does boast some decent specs , with a launch price of ? 480 off-contract for the 64GB model , surely consumers could have expected more than that ?  The Firefly shopping app , which enables users to scan items to search for them online , was also reported to have its fair share of problems .  Considering that this is the company that revolutionised the publishing market with its Kindle ebook range , the Fire Phone has been disappointingly similar to other phones on the market , without benefitting from their extensive library of apps .  Amazon has responded to criticism of the device 's poor sales figures by reducing the price and stressing that it is a long-term project . However , I 'm sure the online giant has learned a valuable , if expensive , lesson from the Fire the already congested smartphone market .  It 's hard to pick just one -- Fadil Pa ? ic  As much as there were great technological releases that really made me say WOW ( Still waiting on that Oculus Rift , and Half Life 3 , though ) , there were also some let down 's .  Among the most disappointing things that happened this year , I 'd like to single out Destiny , as probably the biggest let down in the gaming industry this year ( or maybe ever ? ) , along with wearable " smart " gear , especially watches , and the poor , poor , Nokia phones .  Destiny , the " biggest " game to date in which more than $500 million ( ? 320 million ) was invested , turned out to be just a mediocre , generic FPS marred by pointless DLCs , boring gameplay and limited content .  " Smart watches " that everyone thought would revolutionise the way we use our phones , turned out to be just a wearable notification bar that costs a lot still have a chance to prove worthy , so we 'll just have to wait and see .  Nokia phones , the epitome of quality phones , completely lost the battle with Samsung and Apple . Once a phone industry giant , Lumia got sold to Microsoft , which struggles for a piece of the market pie , but offers mediocre phones , and a digital store with little apps .  No star performance from Samsung Galaxy -- David Curry  Samsung has had a poor year all around , and a major contributor to the failure has to be attributed to the Galaxy S5 .  Billed up as the next step for Samsung , the Galaxy S5 did not bring any major improvements over its predecessor , and failed to compete against some amazing smartphones released in 2014 .  The end result is lacklustre sales -- under 15 million in over six months -- and almost nobody considering the Galaxy S5 as a top ten smartphone of 2014 .  Effects of the Galaxy S5 's failure are far reaching , Samsung has changed its mobile smartphones in 2015 and is apparently working on an all-metal Galaxy S6 .  Hopefully , the failure of the Galaxy S5 can spur Samsung 's design team to make something beautiful , to compete with the iPhone 6 and HTC One M8 . Everyone said this was the plan last year , but Samsung is now coming off a huge market loss , so it should push the phone giant to be innovative .
