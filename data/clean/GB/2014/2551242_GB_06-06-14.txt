Photo : SWNS  Staff at Hatton Country World in Warwickshire could n't understand why they suddenly had 100 pregnant guinea pigs on their hands - until they released one of the male rodents had managed to escape his enclosure and infiltrate the female-only enclosure .  They noticed that the exhausted father-to-be , now nicknamed Randy , had lost a little weight , but did not realise why until they discovered he was actually a male rodent being kept busy in the wrong pen .

Manager Richard Craddock said : " One of our male guinea pigs managed to find his way into the looks of it .  " We suspect a child may have placed him back in the wrong pen by accident after stroking him or Randy may have somehow broken out of his enclosure to get to the females . "  " We believe that the newly-named Randy could have impregnated up to 100 female guinea pigs , which have litters of about four , so if you do the maths we could be expecting quite a baby boom .  Randy is going to be seeing many more of these in the coming weeks . Credit : SWNS  " We do n't know how long Randy was in the female enclosure but it could have been several weeks which would have given him time to go round the entire female population .  " Staff did comment he looked a little thinner than before . He has now re-joined his male friends , clearly he 's got a lot of bragging to do . "  Staff are now looking to build an extension to the guinea pig farm to accommodate Randy 's huge brood .
