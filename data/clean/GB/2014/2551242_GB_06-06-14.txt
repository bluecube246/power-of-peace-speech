<h> Advertisement <h> Guinea pig to become father to 400 after breaking into female enclosure <p> Randy escaped his male only enclosure at Hatton Adventure World in Warwick and broke into the female-only area . Photo : SWNS <p> Staff at Hatton Country World in Warwickshire could n't understand why they suddenly had 100 pregnant guinea pigs on their hands - until they released one of the male rodents had managed to escape his enclosure and infiltrate the female-only enclosure . <p> They noticed that the exhausted father-to-be , now nicknamed Randy , had lost a little weight , but did not realise why until they discovered he was actually a male rodent being kept busy in the wrong pen . <p> Randy , centre , pictured alongside some of the female guinea pigs he mated with Credit : SWNS <p> The animal park , which already has 300 male and female guinea pigs , is now readying itself for a population boom in the next few weeks . <p> Manager Richard Craddock said : " One of our male guinea pigs managed to find his way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looks of it . <p> " We suspect a child may have placed him back in the wrong pen by accident after stroking him or Randy may have somehow broken out of his enclosure to get to the females . " <p> " We believe that the newly-named Randy could have impregnated up to 100 female guinea pigs , which have litters of about four , so if you do the maths we could be expecting quite a baby boom . <p> Randy is going to be seeing many more of these in the coming weeks . Credit : SWNS <p> " We do n't know how long Randy was in the female enclosure but it could have been several weeks which would have given him time to go round the entire female population . <p> " Staff did comment he looked a little thinner than before . He has now re-joined his male friends , clearly he 's got a lot of bragging to do . " <p> Staff are now looking to build an extension to the guinea pig farm to accommodate Randy 's huge brood .
