Northern Lincolnshire hospitals show signs of improvement  Hospitals in northern Lincolnshire have improved standards of care , according to a report by an NHS watchdog .  The Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) said Scunthorpe Hospital , Diana Princess of Wales in Grimsby and Goole Hospital now met national standards .  The CQC made unannounced inspections at the hospitals in December .  However , the NHS trust which runs the hospitals remains in special measures after concerns over higher-than-expected death rates .  The CQC raised concerns over patient care , staff morale and issues with medical records after a previous inspection last year .  Inspectors said that the hospitals " had taken action to improve standards of care and was meeting all of the national standards that were reviewed " .  ' Positive comments '  Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Karen Jackson said she was " delighted by the CQC 's verdict " .  She said : " Staff have worked exceptionally hard over the past year to make sure everything we do and training , is done well .  " It 's very rewarding to read some of the positive comments the inspectors have made in their reports , and we are already working on the areas for improvement that they have highlighted . "  In July , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the trust , which serves a population of 358,000 people , was one of 11 to be placed in special measures following the Keogh Review into higher-than-expected mortality rates in its three hospitals .  The trust said it was awaiting an inspection in April by NHS Monitor , which is responsible for assessing the trust 's progress in reaching the targets set under the Keogh Review .
