England must put Alastair Cook out of his misery

<h> If Peter Moores and Paul Downton care about England 's World Cup chances they must make one simple decision : remove Alastair Cook as ODI captain <p> Removing Alastair Cook as captain of the England one-day team just short of a World Cup would not be a gamble . It is a straightforward decision , certainly not the big deal people are making out , and would be in the best interests of the England team as well Cook himself . <p> I feel like a stuck record and this is not about saying " I told you so " . In fact this is not aimed at Cook . <p> It is aimed at the two men running English cricket : Peter Moores and Paul Downton . In one way I applaud them for sticking by their man but it has gone too far and 99.9 per cent of England supporters , as well as current and former players , can see that . The problem is the 0.1 per cent , which is Downton and Moores , do not see it . <p> It startles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a better standard , which has been to win just one of his last nine ODI series . That is a very worrying sign of how Moores and Downton judge the rest of the group . <p> Downton has said he will sit in on England 's selection meeting on Friday - why ? Is it at the request of Moores because he thinks he will need backing up in case the other selectors argue for Cook to go ? Downton is not a selector . He should not be there . <h> Related Articles <p> Ok he does not have a vote but he is the boss of Angus Fraser , Mick Newell and James Whitaker . They have seen from his interviews this week that Paul is backing Cook as captain . <p> The selectors who have not been in Sri Lanka need to have an honest discussion about the best way forward and how England can compete at the World Cup . Having Downton in the room will stifle that debate . How can a selector raise his objections when he knows his boss has already backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just four selectors and four walls . That way they can make the best decision for English cricket . I always say look in the mirror . As a selector ask yourself is Cook one of the best 15 one-day players in England ? I think he 's not in the top 30 . <p> Cook has to do the same by asking himself if he 's doing best thing for the team by hanging around . If he genuinely believes he is , then carry on but if he thinks England are better without him , then step aside . <p> Ultimately it should be a straightforward move . If they sack Cook on Friday it will not have a big impact on the team . It will not set the side back or fundamentally change the team 's approach to one day cricket . <p> But it would put a frazzled Cook out of his misery , allow him to concentrate on Test cricket and winning the back the Ashes in July . It would also allow England to pick their best team and not have to continually move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last 22 matches . <p> Using his record in Australia as a reason for sticking with him is hanging a hat on a peg that does not exist . In one-day cricket in Australia and New Zealand Cook averages 35 with strike rate of 73 . Hardly starting and does not fit this modern era . <p> Last winter he struggled against Australians bowling full outside a fourth stump . Teams have worked out not to bowl short at Cook . They also bowl spin in one-day cricket . He plants his front foot , using a big forward press , which is fine in Test cricket because it helps you defend , but in one-day cricket it makes you static . You ca n't move again and force the bowler to change his length . The best players of spin use their feet so they can sweep and cut . Cook ca n't do that . He is stationary so it is easy to bowl at him and set fields meaning he will always chew up balls . <p> He must be exhausted by all the criticism . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform . You are not unlucky . It is because you are not scoring runs . <p> A golfing analogy sums up where England are at with Cook . When a smart golfer hits the ball into a bush he takes his medicine , hits it out sideways and walks off with a bogey or double bogey but is still in the tournament . A desperate golfer goes for the magic shot , flaps away and keeps thrashing making things worse . He shoots a 10 or 11 and has missed the cut . England are that desperate golfer thrashing around in the bush . <p> But if they take their medicine and move on then there is hope because England have some very talented players and Eoin Morgan can step in as captain . <p> I know he is not in great form . But Morgan 's highest score last summer was when he captained England in a Twenty20 . His best innings on this trip was when he was in charge too . He clearly likes leadership . <p> There have been positives on this trip . Moeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James Taylor has batted smartly at three and Joe Root has shown outstanding maturity and calmness in the middle order . Chris Woakes has improved and Ravi Bopara has had a good tour too which is why I thought it was staggering he was dropped for the final game . <p> England need his bowling . They lack an X-factor fast bowler or mystery spinner so they need clever bowlers who can mix up their pace like Ravi . Why Cook gave him just 15 overs in five matches is a mystery . <p> With Stuart Broad and James Anderson to come into the side England have a chance of surprising a few people in Australia . But only if they make one simple decision over the next few days .
