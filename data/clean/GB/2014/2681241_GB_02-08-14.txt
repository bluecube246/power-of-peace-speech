never forget the bravery and the selfless sacrifice  commentary : as britain prepares to remember , sajid javid , the culture secretary , on why we should never forget  grave of private john parr , who the first british soldier killed in wwi on 21st august 1914 , st symphorien military cemetery , belgiumphoto : rex  by sajid javid , culture secretary  10:30pm bst 02 aug 2014  within the rich earth of st symphorien military cemetery , there is indeed " a richer dust concealed " . the site , just over a mile from the belgian tourist town of mons , is the resting place of 229 british , irish and commonwealth soldiers of the first world war , brave young men who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country .  they include pte john parr , from finchley , who was just 20 years old when he was killed on august 21 1914 -- the first british combat casualty of the war . beside him lie pte jw gladman , who died two days later , and 34-year-old pte the royal irish regiment .  ptes parr , gladman and walsh fought alongside millions of men from every corner of britain and its empire . when the guns finally fell silent after more than four years of bloodshed , more than 700,000 british soldiers , sailors and airmen lay dead . the commonwealth also paid a heavy price -- new zealand lost around 17,000 men , canada and australia 60,000 each , and more than 65,000 members of the indian army never returned . some 200,000 irishmen served in the british army , with 27,000 falling in battle .  not a single british soldier who took part is still with us .  tomorrow evening around 500 people will gather at st symphorien to commemorate the start of the first truly global conflict a century ago , among them descendants of those buried there -- allied and german -- as well as the duke and duchess of cambridge , prince harry and the prime minister .  other events will also mark the centenary . the day will begin with a service for the commonwealth at glasgow cathedral ,  at 10pm , westminster abbey will host a service of commemoration , with similar services held around the uk , including at st anne 's cathedral in belfast and llandaff cathedral in cardiff .  a century ago , as the spectre of war loomed , sir edward grey , the foreign secretary , was said to have remarked that " the lamps are going out all over europe , we shall not see them lit again in our lifetimes " . between 10pm and 11pm tomorrow , the lights out project will see lamps in private homes , public buildings , places of work and places of worship once again extinguished -- with just a single candle or bulb left illuminating one window as a symbol of continuing hope in darkness . i 'd urge you to take part .  british wwi soldiers in a front line trench , 1915 ( rex )  tomorrow 's events are the start of a four-year , ? 125 million programme of commemorations co-ordinated by the department for culture , media and sport .  next april we will mark the the battle of jutland will focus our memories on the war at sea ; in july 2016 we will commemorate the battle of the somme , in which almost 20,000 britons died on the first day alone ; in the summer of 2017 attention focuses on passchendaele ; and in 2018 we will remember the battle of amiens and celebrate the armistice .  alongside these larger events , a huge variety of smaller and more local gatherings will also reflect the way in which the first world war touched every corner of the united kingdom .  of the 14,000 parishes in england and wales that sent men to the front , only around 50 saw them all come home . not a single community in scotland or northern ireland was so lucky .  a british assault on a turkish position ( rex )  the scale and scope of the first world war is almost unimaginable today , the losses impossible to comprehend .  but we must never forget the lessons we learned from those four bloody years . nor must we forget the way the people , above all we must never forget the bravery and selfless sacrifice of men like private parr , private gladman and private walsh .  so today , and tomorrow , over the next four years and for ever after , at the going down of the sun and in the morning , we will remember them .
