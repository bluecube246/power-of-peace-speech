has there ever been a band less likely to be wildly popular than rodrigo y gabriela , who are about to play two nights at the albert hall and have a london arena date in the offing ? the hit parade is not exactly littered with mexican instrumental acoustic duos who delight in energetically plucked tributes to historical figures including fyodor dostoyevsky , norwegian polar explorer fridtjof nansen and eleanor of acquitane . but then , who knows what direction the next justin bieber album will take ?  this is specialist stuff , surely , so what are the pair doing so right ? " it is surprising , " admits rodrigo sanchez , 40 , who is now considered such a major figure in mexican culture that he and gabriela quintero played a white house concert at a meeting between barack obama and the last mexican president , felipe calder ? n . obama told them he had their music on his ipod ; calder ? n did n't know who they were . " it 's a different proposal but people were ready to  " i had a very clear idea in my head : i wo n't be something that i 'm not , " adds quintero , also 40 , in a singsong voice that leaves no doubt that english is not her first language . " i ca n't write a friendly radio song . that requires a certain talent . we are not gon na try to be something else -- we are this . "  theirs would certainly be a tough blueprint for copycats to follow . having begun their music career in the early nineties in a heavy metal band , tierra acida ( " acid land " ) , in mexico city , they moved to dublin at the start of the last decade to busk as a duo . they started covering hard rock songs in a raw latin style , including led zeppelin 's stairway to heaven and metallica 's orion , both of which appeared on their first proper album , a self-titled release from 2006 . it was a number one in ireland , and their popularity swelled to other countries from snaking around each other , often thumping the body of their instruments for percussion . and that 's it . no singing , no drums , bass or electric instruments . " we 've always done exactly the opposite of everyone else , " says quintero . if it sounds simple , you need to see them live , where fingers blur , feet stamp and the pace and intricacy of their work is almost unfathomable . at their big concerts there are no dancing girls , costume changes or fireworks -- the real special effects are the cameras that capture their fiery fingerwork in extreme close-up .  they 've become a big-time band through word of mouth , not media attention . " we 're not a radio band , but we have played a lot . we develop fanbases just by playing and playing , " says sanchez . he 's an earnest , smiley guy who 's long since tidied his heavy metal hairdo , a passionate vegan ( as is quintero ) who runs for fun and swaps recipe tips with his mate , the american n't big in latin countries , which presumably have a wider choice when it comes to flamenco-style guitar sounds , these days sanchez lives in barcelona and quintero is based in ixtapa on mexico 's west coast . they were a couple but split up two years ago . thankfully , the working relationship has continued . " we have a really good relationship . much better actually , " says sanchez .  " i do n't know how we managed to do it , " says quintero of touring as romantic as well as musical partners . " we fought all the time . but music was one of those things that we could agree on . "  united about their musical direction , they 've managed to resist any thoughts of adding lyrics or dance beats to their potent but minimal mix . so they 've had to find different ways of progressing . their last album , 2012 's area 52 , saw them revisiting their earlier songs with a cuban orchestra . they also worked with hans zimmer on the soundtrack to the fourth pirates they 've given their songs on this week 's new album , 9 dead alive , some heavyweight subject matter , dedicating them to eight figures they deem to be of historical importance -- four men , four women . the ninth song , torito , is named after a mexican cocktail .  you may not hear immediately what the chilean poet gabriela mistral has to do with the haunting notes of megalopolis , or why explorer fridtjof nansen is the subject of fram 's rapidfire strumming . rodrigo y gabriela chose their subjects after the songs were recorded , so they 're not directly related to the music , but it 's enough for the duo that you might look them up afterwards and learn something about eight significant lives .  " it 's just part of what we do as part of our expression . we want to make it speak to us on a personal level . particularly in my own imagination , the music we play is very visual . when i 'm playing i have all these images , " says quintero in an it did n't have a subject , it would just be music . but thankfully for those who have n't read any dostoyevsky , it 's very good music indeed .  the strangest full houses in town  rodrigo y gabriela are far from the only musical oddities selling out massive shows . elvis was obviously a major concert draw for decades but that was when he was alive . now the band is real but the star is a projection , singing and bantering in footage lifted from televised concerts . if you 're used to watching the big screen from the back of an arena , it feels surprisingly normal .  you 'll never hear this boston-formed band 's uncool mix of prog and metal on the radio , yet they played wembley arena two months ago and are high on the bill at the sonisphere rock festival this summer . solo piles upon solo in sets of up to three-and-a-half hours .  never mind the songs in the pop charts , what a large number of concert goers apparently want to hear is the soundtrack themes from games old and new such as final fantasy , the legend of zelda and halo , and even accompanies audience members having a go at some arcade classics on stage .  if you got to the end of the year thinking , " hey , how come i have n't been to more belgian rap shows ? " , here 's your chance . stromae , aka paul van haver from brussels , had a hit across europe with alors on danse in 2010 , leading to work with kanye west and will.i.am . now he 's written belgium 's world cup song and is playing this 5,000-capacity venue .  one of the biggest-selling albums of all time is also one of the weirdest , a two-disc orchestral prog take on hg wells 's classic sci-fi tale . in what 's billed as its last arena tour , it will feature an unlikely cast in jason donovan , brian mcfadden from westlife , x factor alumni shayne ward and joseph whelan and a holographic liam neeson.
