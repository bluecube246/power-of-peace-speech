keep william wallace out of it says danny alexander  i am a highlander . i spent my early years on colonsay in the hebrides , then moved to lochaber and went to high school in fort william . one of the most powerful memories of this time was seeing the commando memorial at spean bridge twice a day from the school bus .  this imposing monument commemorates the role played by young men from all over the uk in protecting our freedom during the second world war .  it 's a sight i have in mind as we approach the decision next month on whether scotland should break away from the uk and become independent .  that memorial , a tribute to the extraordinary strength of our family of nations , is something i will think of when i watch this week 's tv debate between alex salmond and alistair darling .  it 's not often you 'll see a liberal democrat rooting for an ex-labour cabinet minister like darling . but now , more than ever , with only a few down party political differences and stand up for the interests of scotland -- and the uk .  expect fireworks , rhetorical flourishes and verbal acrobatics from the scottish first minister .  related articles  share this article  share  but expect the truth from darling , nothing flamboyant -- just the clear , unvarnished facts that scotland is better off staying inside the uk . these dry facts overwhelmingly prove that we are better together . better in terms of being able to continue to use the pound sterling , better by being part of a larger and recovering economy , better by being part a family of nations with a place on the global stage .  by remaining part of the uk we are more financially and internationally secure and the detailed analysis shows that every man , woman and child in scotland benefits by ? 1,400 each and every year as a result of being part of the uk family .  much as alex salmond ( left ) would like it to be , it is a travesty to try to reduce this to from the heart ' for independence versus a ' stay in the uk ' vote after a sober-minded look at the facts  this is no ' head versus heart ' debate . much as salmond would like it to be , it is a travesty to try to reduce this to a trite william wallace-style vote ' from the heart ' for independence versus a ' stay in the uk ' vote after a sober-minded look at the facts .  in fact , i will vote head and heart to keep scotland and england , and the other parts of the uk , together .  our family of nations is bound by the most extraordinary history -- and it 's that history , of more than 300 years , that makes us the family we are .  while our fellow citizens in other parts of the uk do n't have a vote , they are increasingly finding their voice on this issue .  scottish hero william wallace  people from across the uk tell me scotland and our place in the uk is valued and , so many people in scotland cherish their role in the wider uk , it tells a story -- that we are family of nations which does n't want , need , or have cause for divorce .  i 'm proud to be a highlander , a scot and british too .  why , with all our shared history , with all the evidence overwhelmingly showing that we are better together , when we are part of the most successful family of nations the world has ever seen , would we want to break apart ?
