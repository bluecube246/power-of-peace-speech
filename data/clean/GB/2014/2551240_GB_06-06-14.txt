ross mcewan , chief executive of royal bank of scotland , received shares on friday worth almost ? 1.5m in the bailed-out bank .  the new zealander was handed the shares as part of a signing-on deal when he was first hired from commonwealth bank of australia to run the retail operations of the 81% taxpayer-owned institution in september 2012 . he was promoted to chief executive last october after stephen hester quit and sold just under half of the 432,000 shares which were released to him to meet his tax liabilities .  in a disclosure to the stock exchange , rbs also revealed that three members of the executive team assembled by mcewan had also received shares under previous share bonus schemes worth just over ? 1m . the three are rory cullinan , head of the new mini-bad bank inside rbs , alison rose , head of its commercial and private banking division , and donald workman , head of what is left of the investment bank . their pay deals are being disclosed because they have been put in charge of new number of shares of the three , worth just over ? 600,000 . they are the first instalment of a bonus he received in march he is one of only a handful of top rbs managers to be handed bonuses for 2013 .  the latest set of shares being released to mcewan were part of a ? 3m signing-on deal under which he is still due to receive shares , with the final payment due next year . rbs said he would only receive shares to meet his tax liabilities .  the latest revelations about pay come as rbs prepares to hold its annual meeting later this month . it has already been forced to withdraw a plan to pay bonuses twice the size of salaries because of opposition from the treasury . this means the bank will be restricted to paying bonuses of 100% of annual pay as imposed by the eu cap on bonuses .  even so , mcewan will be handed ? 1m a year in " allowances " -- effectively doubling his salary -- in a reaction to the bonus cap .
