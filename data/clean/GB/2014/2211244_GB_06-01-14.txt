<p> At the Garage Grill in an upmarket Tehran neighbourhood , classic rock plays from the speakers , and photos of Paul Newman , James Dean and hot rods line the walls . It could be an old-time American diner , except that its hamburger prices reflect a wealthier target market here . <p> Next door , Dukkan Burger serves its fare on butcher paper , with Heinz ketchup and French 's mustard supplied on request . The clientele includes young women clutching designer handbags , arriving with their dates in European luxury cars . <p> Greasy burger joints have been part of Tehran 's fast-food landscape for decades , even in the years just after the 1979 Islamic revolution , when any symbol of US culture was denounced as an example of " Westoxification " . They were mostly in downtown working-class neighbourhoods , serving labourers or students watching their budgets . <p> Now , though , high-end burger restaurants are popping up across the city , making the gut-busting American institution the latest trend in Tehran dining . <p> Facebook pages dedicated to local hamburger outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In-N-Out , Burger King and other US chains . That fascination with brands has resulted in such blatant rip-offs as McAli 's , Superstar -- conspicuously similar in appearance to Carl 's Jr -- and even a place calling itself Five Guys . <p> After a string of restaurants catering to Tehran 's rich opened and closed in recent years , observers of the capital 's culinary scene say the rise of the quality burger is not surprising , especially given Iranians ' love of grilled meat . " Burgers are very simple . It 's a promise that 's easy to deliver on , " said Payam Kashani-Nejad , the founder of Gumboo Guide , a website devoted to reviews of Tehran restaurants . " And it 's a big market . " <p> David Yaghoobi , until recently creative director at a top Iranian advertising agency and now based in London , noted that the burger is still somewhat exotic to Iranians , boosting its appeal . <p> " In Iran , most things foreign are considered high-end , and as a burger is considered foreign , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> It is no coincidence , then , that most of the new hamburger restaurants are in the affluent neighbourhoods of northern Tehran , in the foothills of the snowcapped Alborz Mountains -- places such as Niavaran , where Garage Grill and Dukkan could dare to open side by side . <p> A neon Route 66 sign hangs in the front door above the back half of a classic Austin Mini . The car 's front half and the front of an orange BMW 2002 double as the grills . <p> " It 's a short escape into a different environment , " Farhadpour-Shirazi said . " Iranians love the American style . The grass is greener in the US . " <p> In nearby Farmanieh , the most popular of Tehran 's new burger joints , Burgerland , was opened last year by members of the Iranian underground band Barobax . Fans line up to take photos with them , but they deny that that is the main reason Burgerland is packed . <p> " Maybe the first and second time people come it 's to see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't come again and again , " said Khashayar Moradi Haghgoo , who owns and runs the restaurant with his bandmates . <p> Across town , in the western neighbourhood of Shahrak-e Gharb , BurgerHouse sees itself as the pioneer of Tehran 's hamburger craze . In business for three years , owner Amir Javadi said no one else was selling quality burgers in the city when he opened , and then " this year , all of a sudden , burger joints started sprouting like mushrooms " . <p> BurgerHouse started out as just takeout and delivery but accidentally became Tehran 's lone drive-in restaurant . <p> " We noticed that people would pick up their orders and then just sit in their cars and eat , " Javadi said . " There are extra costs for delivery , like the packaging , so we started giving the option of bringing trays to customers ' cars . " <p> Every night , even during the freezing winter , the narrow street that is home to BurgerHouse is lined with cars of regulars waiting for their order numbers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of burgers in Tehran is unconnected to any particular cultural trends or preferences beyond the simple pleasures of the food itself . " No one looks at a burger as something American or even foreign any more , " Javadi said . " It 's one of the world 's favourite foods . "
