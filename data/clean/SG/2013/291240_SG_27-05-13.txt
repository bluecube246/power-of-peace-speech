high bunker prices will mean more slow steaming  " stubbornly high " fuel prices and a rate war in east-west trades will force carriers to further reduce speeds , according to an analysis by drewry .  the firm said it believes ocean carriers are currently losing money on the route and surplus capacity is likely to remain a problem .  there are 31 ships with a capacity of 10,000 twenty-foot equivalent-unit ( teu ) or larger due for delivery this year , but drewry said there is n't a corresponding growth in demand .  " either more vessels will have to be laid up , or further slow steaming introduced , " drewry said .  " the latter is the most logical , particularly as it was difficult to justify throughout most of last year due to freight rates being so high . "  "  either more vessels will have to be laid up , or further slow steaming introduced  drewry  currently , drewry found , there is a wide variation in speeds among carriers .  speeds knots for g6 alliance-loop 4 to 22.2 knots for maersk line-ae2 , and variation among companies for service between asia and west coast north america was similar .  drewry said carriers do not seem to get a significant rate premium for faster service , and schedule optimisation seems to be more important .
