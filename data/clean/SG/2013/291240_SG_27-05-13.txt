<h> High Bunker Prices Will Mean More Slow Steaming <p> " Stubbornly high " fuel prices and a rate war in east-west trades will force carriers to further reduce speeds , according to an analysis by Drewry . <p> The firm said it believes ocean carriers are currently losing money on the route and surplus capacity is likely to remain a problem . <p> There are 31 ships with a capacity of 10,000 twenty-foot equivalent-unit ( TEU ) or larger due for delivery this year , but Drewry said there is n't a corresponding growth in demand . <p> " Either more vessels will have to be laid up , or further slow steaming introduced , " Drewry said . <p> " The latter is the most logical , particularly as it was difficult to justify throughout most of last year due to freight rates being so high . " <p> " <p> Either more vessels will have to be laid up , or further slow steaming introduced <p> Drewry <p> Currently , Drewry found , there is a wide variation in speeds among carriers . <p> Speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knots for G6 Alliance-Loop 4 to 22.2 knots for Maersk Line-AE2 , and variation among companies for service between Asia and West Coast North America was similar . <p> Drewry said carriers do not seem to get a significant rate premium for faster service , and schedule optimisation seems to be more important .
