<h> PM Lee : Govt is planning beyond 2020 <p> AsiaOne Tue , Apr 05 , 2011 <p> SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the issue of leadership renewal will be a major one in the forthcoming elections . <p> In his speech at the University Cultural Centre this evening at the Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum 2011 , he highlighted that the People 's Action Party dominance in Singapore 's government came about partly by historical incidence . <p> But the political stability , good government , and social and economic success enjoyed by Singapore today is also because PAP pursued inclusive policies which represented all levels of society in Singapore , and adapted the political system to avoid divisive politics . <p> This has allowed the current government to bring in and groom fourth generation leadership , as well as think beyond that to find good people to serve Singapore . <p> Here is a summary of all the points in his speech : <p> " Leadership Renewal : The 4th Generation &amp; Beyond " <p> 1 . Timely theme a . A vital question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in the forthcoming elections <p> 2 . But by the standards of other countries , it is a luxurya. 3rd generation leadership is in place , and can serve Singa ? pore for another decade <p> b . We are planning not for the next ten years , but for the decade beyond that -- beyond 2020 <p> c . Very few other countries worry about the country 's leadership so far into the future <p> i . Leaders either worried about immediate problems <p> ii . Or preoccupied with staying in power for as long as they can <p> 3 . Why do we in Singapore have the luxury , and the necessity , to worry now about this long term future ? <p> 4 . We have been stable for last five decadesa . PAP in power for over half a century <p> b . Two leadership renewals <p> c . Bringing in and grooming 4th generation leadership <p> d . And thinking beyond that to continue finding good people to serve Singapore <p> 5 . Discuss two areasa . How did current system come about ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years to come ? <p> 6 . PAP dominance partly a historical incident <p> a . There were ferocious battles in the early years , both among political parties and inside the PAP <p> b . Within the PAP , the communists and their sympathisers battled the non-communists over the future of Singapore <p> c . Eventually in 1961 the leftists split off to form Barisan Sosialis <p> d . PAP and opposition were almost evenly matched after the split <p> e . In 1966 after Independence , Dr Lee Siew Choh took Barisan Sosialis out of Parliament onto the streets <p> f . It was a strategic mistake <p> g . In the 1968 elections , the PAP made a clean sweep , and remained dominant ever since <p> 7 . But political happenings in the 1960s not the only factor <p> a . PAP 's actions since 1966 also critical <p> i . Pursued inclusive policies <p> ii . Represented all Singaporeans <p> iii . Adapted political system <p> iv . Renewed its leadership <p> 8 . First , the PAP pursued policies which gave all citizens a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , created jobs and raised incomes for all <p> b . Invested in education to give every child a bright future <p> c . Promoted home ownership for all , giving every household a substantial nest-egg to protect <p> d . Created an egalitarian and meritocratic society , where all are comfortable to mingle in the same hawker centres and parks , and the poorest families can aspire to have their children do well and rise to the top <p> 9 . Second , the PAP sought to represent the interests of a broad range of Singaporeans <p> a . Rich and poor , white and blue collar , all races and religions <p> b . Co-opted all those committed to serving the country to form a broad movement <p> c . Made the PAP a national government , and not a partisan one , that drew support from all segments of society <p> 10 . Third , the PAP adapted the political system to avoid divisive politics and work for Singapore <p> a . Introduced Non-Constituency MPs ( NCMPs ) in 1984 <p> i . Ensure minimum representation of opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( GRCs ) in 1988 <p> i . Guaranteed representation of minorities in Parliament <p> ii . Promoted multi-racial parties and eschewed race-based politics <p> c . Provided for Nominated MPs ( NMPs ) in 1990 <p> i . Widened range of non-partisan views and enriched debated . Created the elected President in 1991 <p> i . To protect our reserves and the integrity of key appointments <p> ii . Promote responsible politics -- prevent parties from winning votes simply by promising more goodies they have to show how they will fund their spending plans <p> b . Each generation , including your own , has to produce people with ability , passion and commitment <p> i . Who will contribute in the community <p> ii . Become leaders in your own right <p> iii . Help build the Singapore you want to see in the future <p> c . Do not wait to be invited to tea <p> d . We are looking for men and women of ability and integrity , regardless of family background <p> i . Character and values are as important as ability <p> ii . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country <p> iii . Be able to connect with people <p> iv . Have a contribution to make : looking after constituents at the grassroots , thinking out national policies , or mobilising a segment of the population <p> e . For the coming GE , we met hundreds of people for tea ; finally we are fielding 20+ new candidates <p> i . We decided not to field many who had outstanding qualifications <p> ii . But we are fielding quite a number who did not excel academically , who possess other important qualities <p> f . We are proud of our new candidates , individually and collectively <p> i . We will give them responsibilities to test their mettle and ability to solve problems for the people <p> ii . Some will be playing key roles over the next 20+ years <p> g . We will continue searching for talent to reinforce the team , in the 2016 GE and beyond <p> h . Within two terms , the new MPs will have to choose from among themselves the new leadership team and PM <p> i . And start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 21 . No system lasts forever ( MM himself acknowledged this in Hard Truths ) <p> a . Do not assume that the PAP will remain dominant indefinitely <p> b . But if not one dominant party , what are alternative configurations ? <p> 22 . Two-Party system ? How could this emerge ? a . First , society splits along race and religion , with parties being based on racial or religious lines <p> i . Worst possible scenario for Singapore <p> ii . We have done our best to prevent it from happening <p> b . Second , society divides along class lines , with one political group representing the rich , and one representing the poor <p> i . One wanting lower taxes , the other calling for more redistribution <p> ii . Working hard to prevent this <p> iii . By aligning the interests of all Singaporeans , and enable one party to represent both the taxi driver and the CEO <p> c . Third , split on policy , with two groups pushing different policies for Singapore <p> i . Unlikely -- PAP a pragmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 . Most important reason why two-party system is not workable -- not enough talent to form two A teamsa . Leadership is a complex and difficult task in any country <p> b . Singapore more than others needs capable leadership to tackle difficult challenges and maximise chances for our small economy <p> c . With a mediocre government , other countries may muddle through , but Singa ? pore will fail <p> d . Most effective way of arriving at a two-party system is to split the PAP into two <p> i . Seriously considered this , but never did it <p> ii . How to produce two teams , each as good as the combined one ? <p> iii . How to find two Finance Ministers , or two Defence Ministers ? <p> ( 1 ) Finance -- to make judgments on taxes , on expenditures , on the budget ( $50 bn a year ) as well as the reserves ( well over US$100 bn ) <p> ( 2 ) Defence -- not just to invest and spend the defence budget ( $12 bn a year ) wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on assessing senior officers for key posts , on threat assessments and deterrent or defensive responses by the SAF <p> iv . Split into two teams , whichever team is in , it will be a weaker government , and we increase the chances of things going wrong <p> e . That is why I ( and the PMs before me ) go out of my way to scour the land for talent to join the team <p> i . Every election we find on average 3 new MPs who make to Minister <p> ii . But we have 14 ministries to fill , so on average Ministers have to serve at least 4 terms <p> iii . SM Goh recently expressed a personal view that perhaps in future Ministers will only serve two terms <p> iv . But I think this is not possible , simply because of the numbers <p> 24 . Opposition parties pitch themselves as offering Singa ? pore a fall-back should the PAP faila . Sounds plausible , but what does it depend on ? Most critically talent <p> b . If the PAP can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier to do ? <p> c . Consider the choices facing a capable person wanting to serve the nation <p> i . Join the opposition , and spend his life waiting ( and maybe hoping ) for the PAP to fail one day <p> ii . Join the PAP , and help it make sound decisions , implement good policies , and avoid mistakes <p> d . Which makes more sense for him , and for Singa ? pore ? <p> 25 . Reiterate : we accept that some people will want to join the opposition and propound alternative policiesa . By all means join the opposition if the government is wrong or incompetent <p> b . But so long as the government is competent and doing a good job for Singa ? poreans , hope you will make common cause with the PAP team , to ensure that things stay right <p> 26 . What we can and must do to assure Singa ? pore 's future is to develop the strongest possible A team , with depth and resilience a . Competent ministers <p> b . People with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job <p> d . So that as the situation changes , we can always find the right person in the team for the right job <p> e . That is how countries contesting in World Cup soccer form and build up their national soccer teams <p> i . That is how Singa ? pore can form one winning team to compete in the international league of nations <p> 27 . I am now putting together the next A team for Singa ? porea . The PAP candidates in this round will form key members of this team <p> b . They need the voters ' full support -- not just to get elected , but to deliver results for you <p> c . This is the way to safeguard our future -- not to weaken the A team in the hope of buying insurance , but to give the A team the best chance of succeeding <p> c . To do that in a secure , stable , and prosperous Singa ? pore , we must maintain the same high quality of government that we have enjoyed <p> d . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this election <p> i . We have to press hard on leadership renewal now , so that by 2020 , we will have a younger team ready , able not only to maintain the present high standards of government , but to build on that and take Singapore even higher <p> ii . Ten years is not a long time to prepare a new leadership for Singa ? pore <p> iii . Ten years is also not a long time in your life -- by 2020 , you will be young adults , about to enter your prime years <p> e . We need Singaporeans to help this leadership renewal to succeedi . Then we will have good policies that bring prosperity and progress to Singaporeii . Then we can maintain the virtuous cycle for Singapore to succeed and scale new heights for another generation
