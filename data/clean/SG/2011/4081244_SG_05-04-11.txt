" the ministry is buying 472 herman miller chairs ( photo ) , each priced at $575 , for general office use for its staff . the chairs , which are not delivered yet , will cost $271,400 in total . "  this is not the first time that government expenditure from the perspective of a taxpayer has started bordering on whether the expenditure is justifiable .  it reminds me of the expensive chairs for the changi airport terminal 3 . please see here .  my concern is that this the beginning of a designer chairs buying frenzy by all ministries .  under normal circumstances , after a ministry has adopted a spending practice without question as to whether it is financially prudent , another ministry will come to view this as an acceptable practice .  a check indicates that there is a total headcount of 123,899 for 2011 in all the government ministries . currently 472 chairs have been purchased for a headcount of 2,388 in mom , this works out as roughly 20% of the total headcount . if we -- assuming a justification based on " ergonomic design , durability and value for money " -- the government would have to procure another 24,307 designer chairs at a cost of around $14m based on our 20% headcount estimate .  $14m may seem a small sum , except that it is also about 50% of the budget allocated for the elderly and the disable . to give you a further sense of proportion expenditure budget allocated for gambling safeguards is only $2.9m in 2011 singapore budget .  it is clear that when the government feels it is justifiable , the cost is not an issue , and the taxpayer 's money is spent . similar instances of being cavalier with taxpayer money includes the yog and the naming of marina bay .  going forward however , singaporeans should start querying such expenditure . the government , for its part , must understand that our silence is not our consent , when it comes to spending the taxpayer money . specifically in this case , we would like mof 's view on whether this spending practice of procuring designer is the sum of money ( $271,400 ) spent part of the fy 2010 budget or fy 2011 budget ? if it is part of the fy 2010 budget , then it must be asked whether the spending is meant to soak up the unused fy 2010 budget before the workyear ends on 31st mar 2011 .  subscribe to blog via email  enter your email to subscribe and receive notifications of new posts by email .  email address  about us  the online citizen is singapore 's longest-running independent online media platform . our aim is to examine the issues that matter , or should matter , to singaporeans and to reflect the diversity of life , of ideas and opinions , that is singapore .  we believe that singapore 's future is best served by having an informed and involved citizenry that has access to a wide range of sources of news and views and an open and vibrant environment in which to share and to debate ideas and opinions .
