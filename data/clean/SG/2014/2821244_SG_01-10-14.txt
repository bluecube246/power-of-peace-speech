<h> Cambodian MPs move to shore up election oversight <p> PHNOM PENH - Cambodian lawmakers voted Wednesday to enshrine the independence of a key election body in the constitution , in a move to clean up polls routinely tainted by allegations of fraud . <p> The National Election Committee ( NEC ) endorsed the last polls in July 2013 which returned strongman Prime Minister Hun Sen to government and prompted months of political deadlock amid accusations of widespread ballot-rigging . <p> The result saw the opposition boycott parliament for nearly a year , accusing the NEC of political bias and allowing Hun Sen to steal victory at the polls . <p> The impasse was broken after the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party ( CNRP ) received guarantees of electoral reform , including over the independence of the NEC . <p> Wednesday 's unanimous vote to fold the NEC into the charter will see the body reshaped to nine members -- four each for the ruling and opposition party and an independent figure agreed on by both sides . <p> The NEC will work " independently and neutrally " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before parliament . <p> " It is a step towards a new NEC which will ensure democracy , free and fair in the next elections , " opposition Sam Rainsy told reporters . <p> " Now it is in the constitution , we all have to respect it , " he added . <p> All 120 lawmakers present , including Prime Minister Hun Sen and Rainsy , voted to amend the consitution . <p> The CNRP took up its seats in the National Assembly in July this year in return for a promise of electoral reforms . <p> Eng Chhay Eang , a senior opposition lawmaker , told the parliament that bringing the NEC into the nation 's charter would " help prevent a political crisis after each election . " <p> Hun Sen , who has held power for nearly three decades , is regularly criticised by campaigners for ignoring human rights and stamping out dissent .
