cambodian mps move to shore up election oversight  phnom penh - cambodian lawmakers voted wednesday to enshrine the independence of a key election body in the constitution , in a move to clean up polls routinely tainted by allegations of fraud .  the national election committee ( nec ) endorsed the last polls in july 2013 which returned strongman prime minister hun sen to government and prompted months of political deadlock amid accusations of widespread ballot-rigging .  the result saw the opposition boycott parliament for nearly a year , accusing the nec of political bias and allowing hun sen to steal victory at the polls .  the impasse was broken after the opposition cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) received guarantees of electoral reform , including over the independence of the nec .  wednesday 's unanimous vote to fold the nec into the charter will see the body reshaped to nine members -- four each for the ruling and opposition party and an independent figure agreed on by both sides .  the nec will work " independently and neutrally " before parliament .  " it is a step towards a new nec which will ensure democracy , free and fair in the next elections , " opposition sam rainsy told reporters .  " now it is in the constitution , we all have to respect it , " he added .  all 120 lawmakers present , including prime minister hun sen and rainsy , voted to amend the consitution .  the cnrp took up its seats in the national assembly in july this year in return for a promise of electoral reforms .  eng chhay eang , a senior opposition lawmaker , told the parliament that bringing the nec into the nation 's charter would " help prevent a political crisis after each election . "  hun sen , who has held power for nearly three decades , is regularly criticised by campaigners for ignoring human rights and stamping out dissent .
