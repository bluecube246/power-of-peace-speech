<p> SINGAPORE -- When 35-year-old Charlene Loh first felt a lump just below her abdomen shortly after delivering her first-born , she dismissed it as a postnatal quirk . <p> Months later , the symptoms -- ? irregular menses , frequent urination , a bloated stomach and a lump that seemed to have increased in size -- became too obvious to ignore . <p> Diagnosed with early stage ovarian cancer in 2014 when her son was only 15 months old , Mdm Loh recounted the shock and fear she had felt at the time of her diagnosis . <p> By then , the 22cm tumour had taken over her entire left ovary , which was surgically removed as part of her cancer treatment . Her right ovary and uterus were spared as she wished to have more children . <p> " I never thought it would happen to me . The word ' cancer ' is frightening enough but what made me even more worried was my child who is still so young . I was so afraid I was going to die . Fortunately , my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mdm Loh , an online baby clothing store owner . <p> Mdm Loh 's brush with ovarian cancer is no longer an uncommon phenomenon here . Local cancer statistics show that an increasing number of women are grappling with gynaecological cancers , which are cancers that affect a woman 's reproductive organs . <p> Between 2010 and 2014 , there were 1,731 new cases of ovarian cancer , a figure that has increased two-thirds from the 1,054 new cases between 1998 and 2002 , according to figures from the Singapore Cancer Registry . <p> Over the same period , the number of new uterine cancer cases has more than doubled from 907 to more than 2,000 between 2010 and 2014 . <p> OBESITY , DIABETES DRIVING CANCER RATES UP <p> Besides typical risk factors such as age and family history , doctors told TODAY the higher incidence of ovarian and uterine cancers here could be partly due to rising obesity and diabetes rates . <p> Affecting about 11 per cent of Singapore adults , obesity is responsible for an estimated half a million cancers a year worldwide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 . It also suggested that cancers are more problematic for women than men due to obesity-related cancers driven by the female hormone oestrogen . <p> Excess fat tissue increases the production of oestrogen , which can stimulate certain cancers in women including ovarian and uterine cancers , said Dr Wong Seng Weng , medical director at The Cancer Centre , a subsidiary of Singapore Medical Group . <p> At the same time , excess body weight also drives the production of insulin , a hormone that controls blood sugar levels . When in excess , insulin promotes the growth of cells in the body , including cancerous ones , said Dr Wong . Higher animal-fat content in diets and smoking have also been found to be linked to a higher cancer risk , he added . <p> Another notable risk factor for these gynaecological cancers are women having fewer or no children , or having children at a later age . <p> " Childbirth is associated with a lower risk of ovarian and uterine cancer . With the decline in fertility rate in Singapore over the years , I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dr Wong . <p> THE MOST PREVENTABLE GYNAECOLOGICAL CANCER <p> But not all gynaecological cancers are on the uptrend . Cervical cancer rates have been on a steady decline , falling from fifth to the 10th most common women 's cancer in the past decade . <p> Dr Timothy Lim , chairman of Singa ? pore Cancer Society 's Women 's Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Campaign 2016 , said this is likely due to an increased awareness of screening for the disease via Pap smear as well as the recent availability of a test to screen for the human papilloma ? virus ( HPV ) , improving the accuracy of cervical cancer screening . High-risk HPV types are the cause for 99 per cent of all cervical cancers . <p> The society 's latest campaign aims to raise awareness of gynaecological cancers . It encourages girls and young women between the ages of nine and 26 to get a HPV vaccination , as well as a Pap smear screening at least once every three years once they cross the age of 25 . <p> About 45 abnormal results , some suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pap smear screenings that the Singapore Cancer Society provided at its Multi-Service Centre from January to April this year . <p> " Cervical cancer remains the most preventable among the three gynaecological cancers , " said Dr Lim , who is also head of the Department of Gynaecological Oncology at KK Women 's and Children 's Hospital . <p> " Furthermore , the HPV vaccine might also lead to a further decline of cervical cancer in the future , but it would require a good uptake of the vaccine among the young to achieve herd immunity . " <p> According to him , the availability of a standard screening test for cervical cancer means that the disease is typically detected in the early stages , when survival rates are better . ? Between 2010 and 2014 , more than two-thirds of cervical cancer cases were diagnosed at Stage 1 and 2 . <p> OVARIAN CANCER THE DEADLIEST <p> By contrast , ovarian cancer is the most difficult to detect or cure among the trio of gynaecological cancers as it rarely has early symptoms , said Dr Lim . With no proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general population at the moment , most patients discover the disease only when symptoms show . <p> A significant proportion of ovarian cases in Singapore is of a type -- known as clear cell carcinoma -- that tends to be resistant to chemotherapy . <p> They make up about 15 per cent of ovarian cases here , compared to the 5 to 10 per cent of cases in Western populations , said Dr Elaine Lim , senior consultant medical oncologist at the National Cancer Centre Singapore . The centre is conducting ? research to better understand the cancer and is looking for more ? effective treatments through clinical trials . <p> While there is no proven method to completely prevent ovarian or uterine cancer , measures such as taking oral contraceptive pills , having more children early and breast feeding , as well as maintaining a healthy weight through a low-fat diet and exercise , may help to lower risks , said Dr Lim . <p> Six months after completing chemo ? therapy treatment , Mdm Loh successfully conceived and delivered her second child -- a baby girl -- two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to go for follow-up checkups . <p> " I consider my little girl a miracle baby . When I was first diagnosed , I thought I could no longer have more children and felt sorry my son could not have any siblings . But I 'm so blessed my doctor was able to help me ? retain my fertility and I was able to grow a healthy baby in my womb , " she said . <p> Mdm Loh advised women to be vigilant about their health , and said a strong and positive mindset helps when navigating the cancer journey . <p> " I now truly appreciate my life , as well as my family and friends , after the hardship , " she said . <p> From now till July 31 , the Singapore Cancer Society is joining hands with 160 general practitioner clinics across the island to provide free Pap smear screening for cervical cancer . It is available to all female Singaporeans and Permanent Residents aged between 25 and 69 who have ever had sex and have not had a Pap smear in the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society 's Multi-Service Centre in Bishan .
