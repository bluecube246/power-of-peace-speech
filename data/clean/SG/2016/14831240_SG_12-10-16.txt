hart was ' gutted ' after euro howlers  joe hart has acknowledged his poor performances at euro 2016 were a major blow for his confidence .  england goalkeeper joe hart says the mistakes he made at euro 2016 left him " gutted " , but he is determined to move on and show the world what he can do .  hart was at fault in his side 's round-of-16 defeat against iceland , having previously made an error in the group stages against wales .  the torino shot-stopper - on loan from manchester city - has now admitted he should have done better , but he has already left the disappointment of the tournament in france behind after helping england to a scoreless draw with slovenia on tuesday , making a string of fine saves .  " i am gutted about how the summer went , " hart was quoted as saying by bbc .  " i would have loved to have saved the two shots that i should have saved during euro 2016 but they are gone .  " in a good place . football moves quickly . you have to move on . you have got to keep fighting . "
