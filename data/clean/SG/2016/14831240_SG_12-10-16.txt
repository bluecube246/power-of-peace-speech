Hart was ' gutted ' after Euro howlers  Joe Hart has acknowledged his poor performances at Euro 2016 were a major blow for his confidence .  England goalkeeper Joe Hart says the mistakes he made at Euro 2016 left him " gutted " , but he is determined to move on and show the world what he can do .  Hart was at fault in his side 's round-of-16 defeat against Iceland , having previously made an error in the group stages against Wales .  The Torino shot-stopper - on loan from Manchester City - has now admitted he should have done better , but he has already left the disappointment of the tournament in France behind after helping England to a scoreless draw with Slovenia on Tuesday , making a string of fine saves .  " I am gutted about how the summer went , " Hart was quoted as saying by BBC .  " I would have loved to have saved the two shots that I should have saved during Euro 2016 but they are gone .  " in a good place . Football moves quickly . You have to move on . You have got to keep fighting . "
