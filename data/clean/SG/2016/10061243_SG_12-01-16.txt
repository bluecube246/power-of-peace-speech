You are here  Latest oil slide triggers more bets against commodity currencies  LONDON Bets against commodity-linked emerging currencies are on the rise again as crude prices fall to around US$30 a barrel , but volatility remains well below the peaks of last year .  Brent crude 's renewed tumble this year has put commodity exporters ' currencies on course to extend last year 's losses and some , such as the South African rand and the Mexican peso , have hit record lows .  The Russian rouble is inching lower too , 4 per cent off record lows struck towards the end of 2014 , and these spot market losses are filtering into options markets where investors can try to hedge against further weakness . " The oil price fall does pose a challenge for commodity exporters as the weakness is n't fully priced into all the fiscal outlooks yet , " said Dominic Bunning , a strategist at HSBC .  He said most exporting countries had calculated their 2016 budgets using much higher oil prices - Russia 's for instance assumes US$40 . " Even if oil stabilises at these levels , fiscal assumptions will be impacted quite dramatically , " Bunning added .  One-month implied volatility - a gauge of expected exchange rate swings derived from options prices - on the rouble has risen off five-month lows touched at the end of the year , having risen around 4 percentage points to around 20 per cent .  Vols on the South African rand have jumped to a three-week high of 23.6 per cent while those on the Brazilian real last week hit 2-1/2 month highs before subsiding Volatility is on the rise across asset classes , ranging from Wall Street 's main fear gauge of US blue-chip volatility to euro/dollar rates and US junk bonds . Among developed currencies , the Canadian dollar has hit near 13-year lows and the Norwegian crown is near its lowest in more than a year . Implied vols on both are at multi-month peaks .  Gulf currencies , pegged to the dollar , are under pressure too , with the Saudi riyal setting record lows in the one-year forward market .  on a currency rising or falling - also show growing bias for dollar strength versus most EM currencies .  One-month risk reversals on the rouble show bias towards the dollar hit six-week highs at the end of last week while dollar/rand reversals were at one-month highs .  Bearish bets on commodity currencies are however well off the peaks hit last August when the Chinese equity market slumped .  Rouble vols , for instance , were around 70 in early 2015 while rand vols remain off four-year highs hit last month after the sudden removal of a respected finance minister . Brazilian vols rose to around 20 last week but are nowhere near last September 's levels around 30 .  Indonesian rupiah vols inched up last week but have slipped back to mid-December lows . " Vol markets have not reacted massively to the latest leg down in oil markets and that 's possibly because ... positioning is already very long vol , " said Luis Costa , head of CEEMEA FX and debt strategy at Citi .  There may also be a sense of many currencies falls versus the dollar .  The rouble for instance has shed 2.2 per cent so far this year , far less than Brent 's 12 per cent plunge . There is also little sign of panic-selling among the public - a factor that influenced central bank intervention in 2014 . " There are arguments why the weakness may not be as acute as last year and that comes down to valuations , " Bunning of HSBC said . " Second , the market is getting used to the idea that the yuan will trade with more volatility . Last August it was like a big bang , now the shock value is not there to the same degree . "
