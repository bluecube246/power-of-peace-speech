Is this the first official look at the Samsung Galaxy S7 ?  A teaser video seemingly posted to YouTube before its time features Indonesian archer Dellie Threesyadinda and her trusty Galaxy sidekick . This is only significant because the next Samsung flagships are due to show their faces to the world in a matter of days at MWC , and this might very well be it .  She never once comments on the features of the phone , but instead hints at the edgy phone being the perfect partner to help take her to the next level . Aside from that really vague aside , we do get some lingering shots of the smartphone itself and clues into its official features .  If not for the date the video was posted , you 'd easily mistaken the phone for last year 's S6 . It looks largely similar to its predecessor . What is unclear is if the rumour about it being a little bigger than its predecessor is true .  We see water resistance/proofiness making a comeback into its specs list , phone stays out of the rain . And wireless charging gets a little time in the limelight , too . What we 're most curious about though is whether the microSD slot will be returning as well .  There 's also a teaser site that features certain aspects of the phone being highlighted - most notably low light shooting excellence which is hardly a surprise considering the pedigree of last year 's snapper .  Will the next Samsung flagship hit the bullseye ? Or is this all a well-crafted PR ploy to distract us ? We 'll just have to wait and see . There 's only a few more days till the big reveal .
