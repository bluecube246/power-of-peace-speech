is this the first official look at the samsung galaxy s7 ?  a teaser video seemingly posted to youtube before its time features indonesian archer dellie threesyadinda and her trusty galaxy sidekick . this is only significant because the next samsung flagships are due to show their faces to the world in a matter of days at mwc , and this might very well be it .  she never once comments on the features of the phone , but instead hints at the edgy phone being the perfect partner to help take her to the next level . aside from that really vague aside , we do get some lingering shots of the smartphone itself and clues into its official features .  if not for the date the video was posted , you 'd easily mistaken the phone for last year 's s6 . it looks largely similar to its predecessor . what is unclear is if the rumour about it being a little bigger than its predecessor is true .  we see water resistance/proofiness making a comeback into its specs list , phone stays out of the rain . and wireless charging gets a little time in the limelight , too . what we 're most curious about though is whether the microsd slot will be returning as well .  there 's also a teaser site that features certain aspects of the phone being highlighted - most notably low light shooting excellence which is hardly a surprise considering the pedigree of last year 's snapper .  will the next samsung flagship hit the bullseye ? or is this all a well-crafted pr ploy to distract us ? we 'll just have to wait and see . there 's only a few more days till the big reveal .
