" it is with this in mind that fast is launching an initiative to train domestic helpers who have a passion in looking after the elderly to become home-based caregiving specialists , " he said .  there are other eldercare courses for maids available , such as those offered by the agency for integrated care . but these are usually just a few days long .  " the specialist certificate in home-based eldercare programme aims to be more rigorous , and will help employment in other areas back home , " said fast executive director william chew .  the course being piloted comprises 40 sessions of four hours each , and will take place every sunday from next month . it costs about $12.50 a class , although fast members can apply for subsidies .  the training will be conducted by medical professionals trained in gerontology from care - a recruitment agency that specialises in training caregivers who help the elderly or people with disabilities .  care managing director satyaprakash tiwari said participants will undergo a rigorous programme that will help them learn , among other things , how to dress wounds , feed the elderly and communicate with non-verbal cues , such as eye contact and head nods .  " there may sometimes be a communication barrier if different languages are spoken , and non-verbal communication cues are important to demonstrate that the caregiver is listening , " said mr tiwari .  ms carene chin , managing director of employment agency homekeeper , said such courses can help maids gain new skills and increase their competencies , which who goes by one name , believes the course could help her take better care of her employer 's 98-year-old father . said ms yumiarsih , who has been working for the same employer for 13 years : " i learnt to care for ah gong by myself , but i hope to learn more about other things which i 'm sometimes confused about , like how to help him move . "  filipina maid rizalia quilicol , 35 , hopes to take the course as she is keen on helping the elderly . for the past four months , she has been spending her days off volunteering at the windsor nursing home .  " i want to increase my knowledge and learn more about the elderly , and with a certificate , maybe i can work in a nursing centre next time .
