watch out for these fitness and weight loss scams in singapore  the best way to stay fit is still diet and exercise . do n't waste your money on these fitness and weight loss scams .  fitness fads come and go in singapore , but one thing always remains : somewhere out there , somebody is looking to cash in on the latest one .  the number of ways to get fit has n't changed for all of human history . it 's always been diet and exercise , just like we did in ancient rome , when the pyramids were being built , or when humans lived in caves .  in spite of that , there 's always new gimmick being marketed in singapore promising fast weight loss .  here are some fitness scams and rip-offs to watch for :  1 . fad routines  the most notorious fad routine ( that 's now been exposed as such ) is p90x . this is a 90 day diet and exercise regime that is extremely intense , and is guaranteed to confused ' your muscles by rotating the types of exercise .  now p90x does work , but see if you can spot the deception : what happens to anyone 's body , if they diet and exercise for 90 days ? that 's right : they 'd lose weight .  all the talk about ' confusing ' muscles is just marketing spiel , and the creator of p90x mostly admitted it in a new york times interview . when terms like p90x are used , it creates branding : the name is used to justify a higher price for coaching , as it 's a ' special ' method . in reality , it 's just the same as any intense workout programme .  so the next time you 're offered a higher priced package , and it involves a lot of diet and exercise , question if you should pay the premium . you 're probably doing the same thing as a regular workout package .  ( an exception to this are exercise methods meant for highly specialised purposes , such as for medical rehabilitation , ) .  2 . ' one day left ' discounts at the gym  one of the most common sales tactics at the gym is to pressure you with a limited time offer . after your free trial , the salesperson will sit you down and talk about the benefits of membership .  this often concludes with an eye-popping sum , but do n't worry : there 's a huge discount right now . it 's almost half price . the condition is , the sale is expiring today .  this is almost always a con-job . anyone can arbitrarily pad their price by 50 per cent , and then put in a 50 per cent discount ( e.g. instead of selling you the package for s$1,200 , i offer it at s$2,400 but with 50 per cent off ) .  the time limit is just to pressure you to sign up on the spot , as they know you likely wo n't come back after their aggressive tactics .  3 . ' tested ' and ' verified ' supplements can be a ripoff  the is fraught with issues , because for every respectable company there are dozen scams .  in 2014 , raw deal inc ( a supplement producer ) demonstrated that even with government checks buyers are n't safe from rip-offs . raw deal inc would add fillers to dilute their supplements . so while the ingredients and quantity were correct during government inspections , they would be diluted to make more product before being sold to consumers .  in 2013 , it was discovered that many supplement manufacturers in the united states have shady backgrounds . some were involved in the creation of illegal drugs , like methamphetamine , before they started brewing supplements .  think about that before forking out a lot of money for supplements . and throughout all this , we are still only assuming supplements work . it is difficult to test whether they fulfill their advertisements , as everyone 's body absorbs the supplements differently .  overall it 's best to rely on your family doctor 's opinion , rather than trying to filter out the sales pitches for supplements .  4 . choice among fitness scammers . these people pretend to start out as being flabby or unfit , and then ' chronicle ' their journey to looking better . they then often sell services as fitness coaches , or recommend supplements or exercise gear .  but the increasing number of expos ? s suggests many of them may be frauds . the images used are often heavily edited , through tools such as photoshop . sometimes , the before and after images are even taken on the same day , and then edited to make them look different .  not all instagram scammers do this for money -- some just enjoy fame and attention . but when they start to plug products or gyms or services , look out . it might be a con-job .  5 . multi-level marketing recruitment disguised as fitness clubs  you may have been approached to join ' free ' clubs , that promise to be a community to help all members lose weight . one company is well known for doing this in singapore .  what you need to understand about they have products that are not . often , the clubs are an attempt to recruit you to join a multi-level-marketing ( mlm ) programme .  you will be asked to buy and then resell supplements , supposedly in a way that also makes you an income .  do n't get pressured into buying or taking part . if you join the club , you will be hemmed in by dozens of people who try to persuade you to sign-up . you 're better off working out on your own .  about us  the online citizen is singapore 's longest-running independent online media platform . our aim is to examine the issues that matter , or should matter , to singaporeans and to reflect the diversity of life , of ideas and opinions , that is singapore .  we believe that singapore 's future is best served by having an informed and involved citizenry that has access to a wide range of sources of news and views and an open and vibrant environment in which to share and to debate ideas and opinions .
