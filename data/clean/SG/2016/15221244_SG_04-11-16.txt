<h> Dinner with TV may be a recipe for less healthy meals <p> ( Reuters Health ) - Families that eat dinner with the TV on tend to eat less healthy food and to enjoy the meals less than families who leave the TV off , according to a recent U.S. study . <p> This was true even for families that were not paying attention to the TV and only had it on as background noise , the researchers write in the journal Appetite . <p> " Family meals are protective for many aspects of child health , " lead author Amanda Trofholz said by email , adding that parents can take this time to check in with children and teach them about setting limits on their diets . <p> " Having the TV on during the family meal may reduce the opportunity for this connection between family members and blunt the protective effects of the meal , " said Trofholz , a researcher at the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis . <p> To explore the link between TV watching during meals and risk factors for childhood obesity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that included a child aged 6 to 12 . <p> The families were recruited from primary care clinics in Minneapolis between 2012 and 2013 and were mostly from low-income and minority groups . <p> The families recorded two of their family meals using an iPad and reported to the research team what they had eaten and how much they had enjoyed it . <p> The study team assessed the health of the meals themselves , whether a TV was being used and the emotional atmosphere of the meal . <p> Only one third of the families left the TV off during both recorded meals . About a quarter had the TV on for only one meal and 43 percent left the TV on during both meals . <p> Of the families eating with the TV on , two thirds paid attention to the TV while the other third only had it on in the background . <p> Families who ate with no TV playing or with the TV on during only one meal enjoyed their meals more than those that watched during both meals . This was true regardless of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't watch TV during meals ate significantly healthier food than the others . Families that had the TV on but did not pay attention also ate more healthy food than families that actively watched TV while eating . <p> Families eating with the TV on also ate fast food for dinner significantly more often than those with TV-free meals . <p> Children of TV-watching families were not more likely to be overweight or obese than children whose families did not watch TV during meals , however . <p> " A non-distracted meal environment , without the TV on , is an opportunity for children to enjoy eating , try novel foods and self-regulate eating when healthy options are provided , " said Eileen FitzPatrick , an assistant professor at The Sage Colleges in Troy , New York . <p> " Having the TV on during dinner is a distraction which may lead to ' mindless eating ' including overeating without realizing it , " FitzPatrick , who was not involved in the study , said by email . <p> FitzPatrick added that advertisements on TV market unhealthy foods to children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . <p> Families should try to view the family meal as a family event rather than just a necessity , Trofholz said . " Families who see the family meal as a time to connect with and enjoy their families may be more likely to turn off the TV , have a higher quality meal , and enjoy the meal more . "
