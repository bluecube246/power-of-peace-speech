<p> Following the death of three miners in the Turamdih uranium mine in Jharkhand on 28 May , the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament and Peace ( CNDP ) has accused the Uranium Corporation of India Limited ( UCIL ) for flouting safety measures and putting the lives of workers at risk . <p> Three workers lost their lives and nine were injured in a major accident at the Turamdih uranium mine near Jadugoda in Jharkhand on 28 May . <p> Criticising the UCIL for functioning under non-transparency and unaccountability , the CNDP has demanded an independent probe into the accident as well as compensation for the deceased and the injured . <p> " We support the demand of the workers and the local community that an independent probe into the accident must be initiated , and the deceased and injured must be immediately and duly compensated , " the CNDP said in a statement . <p> According to the CNDP , the local community and the larger civil society has been raising voices against the safety procedures in UCIL for decades , claiming the company has been comprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in brazen violation of standard norms . <p> " The criminal negligence and contempt for the surrounding population , which is mostly Adivasi and poor , is shocking . Toxic and radioactive waste is left in open tailing dams and uranium ore is transported in open vehicles . A number of peer-reviewed studies have shown high incidence of radiation-borne diseases in the area . India 's present nuclear regulator , the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board(AERB) is entirely unequipped and ineffective owing to its non-independence , " the CNDP statement read . <p> The CNDP has also demanded that the government must put a moratorium on expanding the uranium mines and initiate an independent enquiry into safety and radiation affects in Jharkhand , involving environmental experts , labour unions and the civil society .
