<p> " I told the Prime Minister this morning that due to his conduct in recent developments , and in light of my lack of trust in him , I am resigning from the government and Knesset ( parliament ) and taking a break from political life , " the former armed forces chief of staff said on Twitter . <p> Mr Yaalon 's surprise resignation comes two days after former foreign minister Lieberman said he would be open to bringing his far-right Yisrael Beitenu party into Mr Netanyahu 's coalition if a number of conditions were met , including being named defence minister . <p> Mr Yaalon had been at loggerheads with Mr Netanyahu over his insistence that senior officers be encouraged to " speak their mind " . Reports said Netanyahu had been considering offering the retired lieutenant general the foreign ministry as a consolation , although the offer was never made . <h> Follow ST <h> The Straits Times <p> We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused .
