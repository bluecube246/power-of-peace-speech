<p> Did you know that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday , 7 November ? And that he visited Srinagar and Ramban , and addressed public gatherings there ? You did n't know , did you ? <p> Now go back to that newspaper you thought you had read enough to know about Monday 's biggest developments . What ? No reports in your newspaper ? That 's okay . Your newspaper is not trustworthy enough . Trust only the government 's news and PR wing , the Press Information Bureau . <p> If you logged on to PIB 's website on 8 November , you might have been tricked into believing that the PM finally ended his self-imposed boycott of J&amp;K . <p> " English rendering of the text of PM 's remarks at the public gathering in Chanderkote , Ramban , in Jammu and Kashmir , " said one of the press releases on the homepage . <p> Screenshot of the PIB homepage with the link to PM Modi 's speech highlighted . <p> Clicking on the link took one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 17:49 IST . <p> Screenshot of PM Modi 's speech on the PIB , with the date ( 7 November 2016 ) highlighted . <p> The release was baffling because no other source corroborated Modi 's visit to the state .

There were no tweets on the visit either , including from Modi 's own Twitter handle . <h> What really happened <p> What really happened was that the PIB committed a major blooper by re-posting an old speech . Modi had visited J&amp;K exactly a year ago , and the speech referred to in the PIB release was from that visit . <p> PIB realised its mistake later in the day and quietly removed the post from the homepage . <p> Screenshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modi 's speech was removed . <p> It also changed the date on the transcript from 7 November 2016 , 17:49 IST , to 7 November 2015 17:49 IST . <p> Assistant Editor at Catch , Charu enjoys covering politics and uncovering politicians .
