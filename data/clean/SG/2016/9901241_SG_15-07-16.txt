WASHINGTON : The U.S. Congress on Friday will receive 28 classified pages of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States , House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said .  " The documents are coming to Congress today , " she said at her weekly news conference , adding that she was not sure when the material would be made public .  Some U.S. lawmakers have alleged the 28 pages link Saudi government officials to the 2001 attacks . CIA chief John Brennan said in June that people should not take them as evidence of Saudi complicity .  The still-classified section of the report on the attacks , informally the 9/11 Commission Report , is central to a dispute over whether Americans should be able to sue the Saudi Arabian government for damages . The Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence has been reviewing the material to see whether it could be declassified .  Legislation allowing such lawsuits has been making its way through Congress . President Barack Obama has said he will not sign any a national security threat to the country and is opposed by important U.S. allies .
