the portuguese side had trailed for much of the game through jelle vossen 's early strike , but miguel layun 's strike and silva 's last-gasp penalty completed the turnaround for porto in the champions league group g encounter .  porto remain in third place ahead of the reverse fixture between the sides in portugal next month , but are now level with copenhagen on four points .  and nuno believes his side were well worth the crucial three points .  " we believed until the end , " nuno told rtp .  " we did n't start the game as we wanted but we got up and reacted .  " i want to emphasise the attitude of the players , who fought for this victory which i consider fair .  " we had no margin for error and the team showed great character . we are proud to see the team give a response like this . "  silva 's goal was his eighth in seven games for club and country , but he said that porto 's victory knew it was a difficult and important game for us , " he told ojogo .  " we had the misfortune to concede a goal but we were lucky to be able to get what was a good win for the team .
