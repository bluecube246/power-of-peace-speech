The Portuguese side had trailed for much of the game through Jelle Vossen 's early strike , but Miguel Layun 's strike and Silva 's last-gasp penalty completed the turnaround for Porto in the Champions League Group G encounter .  Porto remain in third place ahead of the reverse fixture between the sides in Portugal next month , but are now level with Copenhagen on four points .  And Nuno believes his side were well worth the crucial three points .  " We believed until the end , " Nuno told RTP .  " We did n't start the game as we wanted but we got up and reacted .  " I want to emphasise the attitude of the players , who fought for this victory which I consider fair .  " We had no margin for error and the team showed great character . We are proud to see the team give a response like this . "  Silva 's goal was his eighth in seven games for club and country , but he said that Porto 's victory knew it was a difficult and important game for us , " he told Ojogo .  " We had the misfortune to concede a goal but we were lucky to be able to get what was a good win for the team .
