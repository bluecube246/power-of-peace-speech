And while this report does not affect the ongoing trial , in which the chargesheet has already been filed and the son of a BJP leader is among the prime accused , it has begun to stir UP politics , less than a year before the state elections .  It may be worthwhile to remember that the initial report about the meat samples had found them to be belonging to a ' goat or its progeny ' . A vetenarary officer , in his report just a few days after the incident , on 28 September 2015 , had said : " Prima facie , it seems that meat found in Dadri lynching victim 's house belongs to goat progeny . "  Politically-motivated questions  On Wednesday , the Chief Minister of UP , Akhilesh Yadav questioned the authenticity of the latest lab report from the Mathura forensics lab .  " Where was the sample sent , who received it ? There was nothing objectionable in his house . All eyes are on this matter . Everyone wants that the victim 's family to " Yadav told reporters in Lucknow .  He added that after this incident : " There was a debate in the world regarding what to eat and speak . I think one should not get involved in such matters . "  On the other hand , BJP MP Yogi Adityanath demanded an FIR against Akhlaq 's family for slaughtering a cow . Interestingly , an outfit related to Adityanath had actually offered to distribute arms to Hindus in the aftermath of the incident .  Adityanath made two other demands from the UP government . " The innocent Hindus arrested in the matter should be immediately released , and the state government should withdraw all facilities given to Akhlaq 's family , " he said .  Akhlaq 's family moved into an Air Force base in New Delhi a few days after the incident , are still living there . The family was given Rs 45 lakh in compensation , and a flat in Greater Noida .  His younger son Danish , who was injured in the mob violence , has also been promised a job as for what ?  A member of Akhlaq 's family , who was asked to react on the latest developments , said : " Let them file an FIR against us , as they 're bragging . On what basis will they lodge an FIR ? They got these meat samples from the street . These samples were never taken from our house . We will not let these people use us as a political instrument . "  The significance  The UP Assembly elections will be the BJP 's biggest poll battle after Bihar , which it lost . The party will obviously be looking to consolidate Hindu votes , and this forensic lab report is likely to provide it with a lot of thrust , especially through hardliners like Adityanath .  Other parties in fray for UP 2017 may have to deal with this report more carefully - by defending everyone 's right to eat and live however they want , just as Yadav said on Wednesday , but sympathising with the emotions with which Hindu voters may be looking at this issue .
