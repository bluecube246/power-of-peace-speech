<h> He 's on list of best business professors in the world - and the only one under 30 <p> If you walk into one of Sam Yam 's classes at the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) Business School for the first time , you may think he is a student rather than the teacher . <p> Not only is he just 27 , but he also often shows up for lectures dressed more casually than his students , at times even wearing shorts . <p> Despite his youth , Assistant Professor Yam , who specialises in business ethics , has authored and co- authored dozens of research papers and delivered presentations at universities all over the world . <p> Since becoming a professor last year , he has already had six papers published in the best journals of his field , including the Academy of Management Review and Journal of Applied Psychology , said Professor Michael Frese , head of the Management and Organisation department at NUS Business School . <p> " Sam 's research has won two Best Paper Awards in the Academy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just last month , Prof Yam was named in a list of the 40 best business professors under the age of 40 by Poets and Quants , a website that covers business school news . He was the only one under 30 in the list which included scholars from Harvard , Yale and Oxford . <p> FOR ARGUMENT 'S SAKE <p> I like to argue with people . If I 'm not arguing , I like to watch people argue with each other . <p> ASSISTANT PROFESSOR SAM YAM <p> Born and raised in Hong Kong , Prof Yam did his university studies in the United States - his taxi-driver father had worked hard to send him there when he was just 16 . <p> He spent the next 10 years there , picking up degrees including a bachelor 's in psychology and a doctorate in organisational behaviour , both from the University of Washington . <p> Last June , he moved to Singapore with his wife Cindy , 27 , also from Hong Kong , and a former bank branch manager at JP Morgan , to be nearer their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in less than two weeks . <p> What may prove surprising is that Prof Yam had no background in business before he began teaching at NUS Business School . <p> " I 've never taken a class in business , " he said with a laugh . <p> " My interests are really in religion , philosophy and politics . But as much as I like ethics , the philosophy of ethics is very abstract . I like something more applied , something I can see . <p> " Business ethics seemed like a good way to make an impact , too . " <p> In a recent paper , he explored the effects of companies forcing employees to take part in Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) practices , such as volunteering , donating to charity and helping at welfare groups . He found that a process called moral licensing may cause such practices to backfire . <p> " The idea is that when you force employees to be pro-social people , they gain a sense that they 're doing something really good , even though they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensated for it , so they gain that sense of psychological entitlement and they feel freer to engage in unethical behaviour later on , " he explained . <p> The study , for which he is credited as the lead author , took nearly four years to finish . <p> His research achievements may be impressive , but his approachability and personal touch is what his students remember him for . <p> Mr Andy Lua , 23 , a second-year business student who took his class on Leadership and Ethics , said he once sent him an e-mail on assessment criteria . <p> Mr Lua was pleasantly surprised when Prof Yam started having a conversation with him and attached a research paper for him to read , after noticing that he was interested in a particular topic . <p> Said Mr Lua : " It was these little acts that make me feel that he is an exceptional educator . " <p> Prof Yam , in turn , feels that students here are easier to teach than those in the US . " US students tend to ask more questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not as much as students from China and Hong Kong , " he said . <p> Despite his prolific research output , he also finds time for hobbies such as basketball , video games and board games . <p> " I do n't really work long hours as people might assume . I work eight hours a day , I come to office around 7 and I leave by 3 or 4pm , " he said . <p> " I think my professional interests do affect my personal life . Yes , I like to argue with people . If I 'm not arguing , I like to watch people argue with each other . " <p> If he had not gone into academia , he said he would have become a taxi driver like his father . <p> But he appears to be more successful at writing research papers than getting to be a taxi driver in Hong Kong . He said : " I even tried to apply for the licence in Hong Kong , but I failed . You have to score at least 96 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult .
