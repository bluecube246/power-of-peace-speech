TODAY file photo <p> SINGAPORE -- Two new statutory boards will be formed to drive the SkillsFuture movement and help Singaporeans find the jobs they want , a move welcomed by observers , who cited better alignment across the wide variety of training programmes available and improving quality in the private education sector as among the likely benefits . <p> The first statutory board , SkillsFuture Singapore ( SSG ) -- overseen by the Ministry of Education ( MOE ) -- will focus on the implementation of SkillsFuture , coordinating both pre-employment training ( PET ) and continuing education and training ( CET ) for workers . The Council for Private Education ( CPE ) , currently the regulatory body for the private-education sector , will be subsumed under the SSG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Workforce Skills Qualification scheme , which was under the Workforce Development Agency ( WDA ) , would also come under SSG 's purview . <p> The WDA will become Workforce Singapore , overseen by the Ministry of Manpower ( MOM ) . It will retain the WDA 's functions of employment facilitation , career services and industry engagement . <p> MPs interviewed by TODAY noted the benefits of having SkillsFuture programmes come under the purview of one entity . " It makes absolute sense that if learning is lifelong , then there should be one ministry promoting and coordinating both PET and CET . Working in silos does not make sense , " said Ms Denise Phua ( Jalan Besar GRC ) . Currently , oversight of both PET and CET initiatives is split between both the MOE and MOM . <p> Ms Phua , who is also Chairperson of the Government Parliamentary Committee ( GPC ) for Education , added that the reorganisation would also bring about " greater alignment and porosity across the various training qualification systems -- in academics , vocational , adult learning and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be missing input about the industry that MOM could provide , she noted that Acting Minister for Education ( Higher Education and Skills ) Ong Ye Kung , who will be in charge of the SkillsFuture movement , was the chairman of the Employment and Employability Institute ( e2i ) " for many years " and many of the higher education institutes had links to industry . <p> Mr Ang Wei Neng ( Jurong GRC ) said SkillsFuture would still very much be " a tripartite relationship " involving , among others , MOM , MOE and the Ministry of Trade and Industry , ensuring the links with industry are maintained . <p> In a joint press release announcing the reorganisation today ( Jan 12 ) , the MOE and MOM said that by bringing the SSG under MOE 's , the Government can tap both institutes of higher learning -- such as polytechnics and universities -- and private training providers " to move SkillsFuture efforts forward as part of a holistic system of lifelong learning " . <p> In a Facebook post today , Mr Ong called the restructuring " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lifelong Learning will be one and integrated , " he said . In October last year , Mr Ong had pointed that the increasing array of higher education credentials -- ranging from qualifications from vocational institutions , to university degrees and industry certification -- must be aligned to " speak the same language " , and this included ensuring quality .
