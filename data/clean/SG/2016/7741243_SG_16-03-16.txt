<h> You are here <p> Apple is about to take the covers off a new ( sorta ) kind of iPhone . It 's a still unexplained bit of sorcery that could only come from a company staring at its first ever down year for iPhone sales . <p> PHOTO : REUTERS <p> Mar 17 , 2016 7:29 AM <p> NEW YORK Apple is about to take the covers off a new ( sorta ) kind of iPhone . It 's a still unexplained bit of sorcery that could only come from a company staring at its first ever down year for iPhone sales . <p> Breaking from its typical September smartphone launch window , Apple is holding an event on Monday to show what is expected to be a new iPhone that flashes way , way back - to 2013 . This new model , perhaps called the iPhone SE , is likely to have the same basic dimensions as Apple 's two-and-half-year-old iPhone 5S , but with updated computer chips and features to make the throwback feel fresh . <p> The big question is why this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device essentially slides in as a replacement for the 5S , which Apple continues to sell for a base price of US$450 - or US$200 less than the latest iPhone 6S . The iPhone Throwback may even have the same price as the 5S . <p> It 's not likely to pad iPhone sales by much . UBS expects the tweener phone could add about 12 million incremental iPhone units to Apple 's total this year . That 's roughly 5 per cent of total expected iPhone sales for the fiscal year ending in September . <p> But the new/old phone does expose Apple 's soft underbelly : Too many iPhone owners have n't been swayed by the latest and greatest ( and most expensive ) models and have stuck with their old devices . Apple is smart to try every trick it can to budge the Un-Upgradeables , who have blown a hole in the company 's revenue this year . <p> About 18 months after the introduction of the larger-screen iPhone 6 line and its successors , about 40 per cent of existing iPhone owners have bought one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was the most momentous and anticipated change to the iPhone ever . The Un-Upgradeables are n't only in economically troubled countries , either . In the US , at least 55 per cent of iPhones are models that are least two and half years old , according to January estimates from research firm Kantar Worldpanel . <p> UBS analyst Steven Milunovich recently conceded he was too optimistic in forecasting that 70 per cent of existing iPhone owners would trade up to the 6 or 6S line by the end of Apple 's fiscal year . The upgrade canyon has a huge impact on Apple , which sells the majority of new iPhones to people who already have one . <p> Share of existing iPhone owners who stuck with 2013 or earlier models is 60 per cent , and luring the Un-Upgradeables is critical to Apple for three reasons . <p> One , the newest models have higher average price tags , helping Apple gobble roughly 90 per cent of the profits in the smartphone hardware world even with just 15 per cent market share . <p> Two , spurring people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives Apple a stockpile of devices it can resell at manageable prices in places like India , where more than a billion people are just starting to catch the smartphone wave . <p> Third , and most critically , selling new iPhones is essential to Apple 's effort to change the company 's complexion . More people with shiny new iPhones mean more happy Apple loyalists who give the company more chances to squeeze money from them in the form of more app downloads , Apple Music subscriptions and payments to store photos and files on iCloud . <p> Apple CEO Tim Cook has emphasized how important Apple 's US$20 billion-a-year " services " business is to the company 's future . The strategy hinges on Apple making sure the iPhones its customers carry are as new and awesome as possible . If it ca n't persuade people to buy a brand new US$650 iPhone 6S , maybe it can interest them - yes , you , the guy with the iPhone 4 held together with duct tape - to pony up US$450 for a new iPhone SE . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because of money troubles or preference for a phone that is smaller than a slice of toast but because each year the new and improved smartphones are n't that much of an improvement . <p> What if we 've switched into a period when people hold on to their phones for longer ? AT&amp;T executives have said they noticed this phenomenon . Longer replacement cycles crushed companies that made personal computers , and more recently Apple has acknowledged iPad owners are sticking with older versions for longer than the company expected . In part because of this trend , iPad sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters . <p> The end of carrier smartphone subsidies in many countries has also exposed that the true price of a new iPhone is n't US$200 but US$650 or more . AT&amp;T has said more than two-thirds of its smartphone subscribers now are on contracts that make them pay full freight for a new phone . So Apple is wisely experimenting with a hybrid iPhone that has many of the hallmarks of a new edition , but without the painful price tag . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's time for Apple to change its increasingly untenable naming conventions for the iPhone . Please , please , please . The same rationale is behind Apple 's iPhone financing and trade-in programs , which let people spread out the payments for an upgraded phone . <p> Jan Dawson , chief analyst at industry research firm Jackdaw Research , said the iPhone SE also helps prop up iPhone sales between now and when the next iPhone model ( presumably iPhone 7 ) will be introduced in September . A smaller screen iPhone also has the added benefit of lower component costs , and therefore higher margins for Apple . <p> This column does not necessarily reflect the opinnion of Bloomberg LP and its owners .
