Online Islamic portal launched  An online portal aimed at ensuring that the Muslim community gets religious knowledge from recognised sources was launched yesterday by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore ( Muis ) .  Besides being able to access articles from accredited religious teachers , users on LearnIslam.sg can also sign up for Islamic education programmes run by mosques and other Islamic education providers .  The site , targeted at young adults , was unveiled by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim at the Al-Iman Mosque in Bukit Panjang . Asked if LearnIslam.sg was created to counter websites which may have radical messages , Dr Yaacob said this would narrow the potential of the site .  " We must use our efforts to try and enlarge and deepen the understanding of Islam.The positive narrative is important for our young people - that Muis is here to assist them if they have any questions , " he said .  " Along the way , they understand what are the values we hold dear in Singapore , what are the things they can do what we have here , " he added .  Ahead of the Ramadan fasting month , the website will have prayer schedules and recipes for pre-dawn and break-fast meals .  Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir , deputy director in the Office of the Mufti , said the site would be a repository of Islamic knowledge from the right sources . " This is part of Muis ' ongoing effort to develop structured Islamic learning platforms and further enhance services to the community , " he said .  Dr Naziruddin said it would help ensure the rise in religiosity in the Muslim community would be guided by recognised religious teachers .
