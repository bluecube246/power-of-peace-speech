TRAI begins review of telecom interconnect charges  Sectoral regulator TRAI ( Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ) has started the review of interconnection charges - paid by one telecom operator to another for connecting phone calls - against the backdrop of 4G and Internet telephony changing the way consumers communicate .  At present , the termination charges for a mobile to mobile local and national long distance call is pegged at 14 paise per minute , while the termination charges for international incoming call to wireless and wireline stands at 53 paise per minute .  In its consultation paper on IUC Friday , TRAI has sought public view on how domestic termination charges should be computed - cost based or Bill and Keep ( BAK ) - for " maximisation of consumer welfare " , adoption of more efficient technologies and growth of the telecom sector in the country .  Put simply , in BAK method , each telecom operator bills its own subscribers for outgoing traffic that it sends to other interconnecting network and keeps the revenue received from its subscribers .
