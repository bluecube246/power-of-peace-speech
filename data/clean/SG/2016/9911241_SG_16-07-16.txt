singapore - when the opening chords of the national anthem are struck at this year 's national day parade , audiences can expect to see the state flag soar past the national stadium before making its way across the skyline of the city 's southern coast , from the domes of gardens by the bay to the three towers of marina bay sands .  this is the first time that the state flag flypast will be taking this route - and those who are watching the parade at home will also be able to see the breathtaking vistas during the flypast , which will be captured on screen .  preparations for the flypast involved a team of about 300 active and operationally ready national servicemen in the lead-up to the ndp . even the task of rolling up the flag - which measure 27m by 18m , is a mammoth one that takes 25 people about two hours to complete .  while only one flag will be seen during the actual flypast , back-ups are prepared in case of damage , with rolled flags sembawang air base .  the task of rigging the flag to the helicopter is also a tricky one . ballasts , cable slings and a release rope are first attached to the flag . the flag weighs a whopping 1,247kg after it has been rigged , with close co-ordination required to ensure that the rolled flag unfurls fully and remains in good condition when the ch-47d chinook helicopter carrying the flag leaves for the flypast from the air base .  lieutenant colonel liao ming hao , the 35-year-old pilot of the chinook helicopter , said that one of the key challenges is the level of precision that is required .

" before the flag is actually picked up ... my heart beats very fast because at the end of the day , it is still our national flag , " he told reporters at a media event last week ( july 9 ) , outlining how pains are taken to prevent damage to the flag at every stage of the process .
