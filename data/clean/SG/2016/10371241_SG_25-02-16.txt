he may not have the powers of marvel superhero ant-man , who can shrink himself to the size of the insects . but aspiring ant researcher mark wong has such a strong passion for studying them that he often spends his weekends crouching close to the ground in nature reserves , eye to eye with his favourite bugs .  " i find them incredibly fascinating ; there are so many different species , each with its own unique behaviour , " said mr wong , a 25-year-old civil servant .  trap-jaw ants , for instance , can open their mandibles ( mouthparts ) very wide and snap them shut rapidly at over 2,300 times faster than the blink of an eye .  this action not only helps the ants capture prey , but is also an escape mechanism - it can catapult them into the air away from potential threats , mr wong said .  " the amount of force generated by that movement is very large , and it is intriguing how these ants evolve and utilise such a unique ability . he set up a makeshift laboratory in his bedroom , complete with field and lab equipment borrowed from other scientists . he also has a cupboard stocked with ant specimens , some of them soaked in ethanol for preservation .  " when i was young , i used to take other insects home , including grasshoppers and praying mantids , " said mr wong .  when he was 11 , praying mantids swarmed the balcony when he did not close a breeding tank properly .  on another occasion , a centipede that he rescued from school escaped from a container with holes into his parents ' bathroom . " i 've given my parents several scares over the years , but i am thankful that they 've grown accustomed to my insect idiosyncrasies now , " he said .  recently , he discovered a new ant species while looking at the diversity of native ants , which have not been well-studied .  as he is not a full-time researcher and has little access to traditional sources of funding , he is hoping to raise money via more than $500 has been pledged to his project , titled discovering the ants of singapore , since it was listed last week .  he hopes to raise $3,000 by next month , and intends to use the money for scientific journal publication fees and to buy better equipment .  he notes that insects are not as well-loved as other animals , but hopes to draw more attention to them through his instagram account , @antsofsingapore , where he posts close-up photographs of singapore 's ants .  the need to be careful about money has spurred him to innovate . his close-up shots of dozens of different ants are not shot with state-of-the-art equipment , but achieved by aiming the camera on his iphone through the eyepiece of the microscope . it is not always easy to get the right distance and angle between the phone and the microscope , he said .  although the quality of his photographs does not comparewith those captured by a dslr or an imaging station , the beauty of ants and interesting facts about their biology still shine through , mr may look just like red or black dots , but , up close , you start to see a variety of unique body shapes and beautiful structures , which i 'm sure more people would appreciate if only they got the chance to see them .
