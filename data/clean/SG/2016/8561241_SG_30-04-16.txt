Speaking to the media after a visit to Bukit Batok -- his first since 2009 -- Mr Lee acknowledged that in a multi-racial society , race would be an issue on people 's minds . " But I think when they vote for somebody , they should not be voting on the basis of race , but they should be voting on the basis of his ability to contribute , his sincerity , the heart , the colour of his heart and his commitment -- which is red -- regardless what race or religion he may belong to , " he said .  RelatedNews  Apart from word going around the constituency - which Minister for Culture , Community and Youth Grace Fu also alluded to during the People 's Action Party 's ( PAP ) rally on Friday - Mr Lee said he has seen some comments online making the point about race in " a quite open way " . In particular , such comments were made in response to Facebook postings by Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP ) chief Chee Soon Juan , Mr Lee pointed out . Dr Chee is up against PAP long-time activist Murali Pillai in the Bukit Batok by-election .  He noted that it is not unheard of for racial sentiments to emerge and be exploited during election campaigns . He recalled how the race issue came up during the campaigning period for the 1984 General Election , where PAP candidate Chandra Das was up against SDP 's Mr Ling How Doong in the Chong Boon Single-Member Constituency ( SMC ) . " They did n't say vote for ( Mr Ling ) , they did n't say the other chap was no good . They just asked , ' Has that Indian man come yet ? ' Everybody knew what it meant , there was a special UHF signal there , so you say one thing , what you mean is another thing , " he added .  Referring to Mr Murali 's performance in last year 's General Election as part of the PAP 's Aljunied GRC team , Mr Lee said that Mr Murali has shown that he was " able to connect with voters Lebar division . " If Paya Lebar had been an SMC , Murali would be their MP by now . But it was a Group Representation Constituency , so overall , we missed winning by a very narrow bit , " he added .  On Friday , Ms Fu warned voters against those playing the race card by " asking Chinese residents to vote for Chinese only " . " We know some people have gone around saying this , " she said . She added that she hoped the SDP was not resorting to this and called on the opposition party to clarify its position .  Speaking to reporters during the walkabout on Saturday , Mr Murai acknowledged that racial issues are present in society . " But ultimately I am confident that if I can show to our Bukit Batok people that I 'm sincerely interested to solve their issues , I can overcome their language issue , the race issue together with my committed group of volunteers , " he said .  In response , Dr Chee - who was greeting residents in the constituency was " absolutely appalling " and called on the ruling party to " stop playing politics " . " If the PAP wants to talk about racism , then I refer you back to some comments PAP leaders have made about Malays , " he said . Regarding the comments made on his Facebook page , Dr Chee said it was impossible to go through every comment posted by netizens but he called for parties to stay away from personal attacks -- be they on race or personal indiscretions -- during the campaign .  Following his visit to Bukit Batok , Mr Lee said Mr Murali stands a " good chance " in the by-election . " From the reports from our activists , from what I can see and what the residents show , I think that they know Murali , they recognise him , they know ' Ah Mu ' which is important , they remember him because he 's gone house visiting , and he 's done things for them from the last time when he was here as branch secretary , " he added .  , Senior Minister of State ( Home Affairs and National Development ) Desmond Lee and Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling ( Education and Trade and Industry ) were also present during the walkabout to lend their support to Mr Murali.
