REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg <p> NEW YORK : A U.S. judge on Wednesday declined to throw out the alleged confessions from two nephews of Venezuela 's first lady , ruling they knew what they were doing when they spoke to U.S. agents after their arrest on narcotics charges . <p> Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas , 30 , and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores , 29 , are scheduled to go on trial next month in federal court in New York City on charges they conspired to import cocaine into the United States . <p> Their statements to agents , as well as other material they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutors as key pieces of evidence . <p> Lawyers for the two men , who are nephews of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 's wife , Cilia Flores , had argued they were in custody for hours before agents identified themselves and that they did not fully understand their U.S. right to remain silent . <p> In a written opinion , U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty said the men were informed of their rights and had signed waivers of those rights before confessing to agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . Campo Flores even told agents he was an attorney , the judge said . <p> " There is no credible evidence that the DEA agents used mental or physical coercion in eliciting defendants ' waiver or statements , " Crotty wrote . <p> The judge also declined to suppress secretly made audio recordings of the two men , who are cousins .

Flores in January called their arrest a " kidnapping . " <p> The nephews were arrested at a hotel in Haiti in November 2015 and flown to the United States . They are fighting U.S. charges that they worked with others to try to send 800 kilograms of cocaine from Venezuela to Honduras for importation into the United States . <p> The case , which arose from a DEA sting operation , is one of several U.S. investigations that have linked individuals connected to the Venezuelan government to drug trafficking . <p> ( Reporting by David Ingram ; Additional reporting by Nate Raymond ; Editing by Alan Crosby )
