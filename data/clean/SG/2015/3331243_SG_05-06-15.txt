<p> Bangalore-based Tracxn , which provides research on startups and emerging sectors to institutional investors , has launched a curated fundraising platform called Tracxn Syndicate to help startups raise capital from angels . The team will pick one or two of the most promising startups from upcoming sectors after thorough analysis . The platform will then showcase up to two startups every week on the Syndicate platform to all registered angels . <p> Neha Singh , Co-founder of Tracxn <p> " Unlike traditional syndicate platforms , the core focus will be on curation of startups and matching them with relevant value-added angels . We use our extensive startup data analytics platform and an army of sector-specific analyst team to provide a curated flow of early-stage deals for angels , " says Neha Singh , Co-founder of Tracxn . <h> Addressing the problem of discovery of startups <p> Indian startups end up wasting a lot of time and effort in approaching the right investor and the entire fundraising process might take more than six-seven months . Tracxn Syndicate aims to address the problem of discovery of startups by angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co-founder of Tracxn <p> " With a boom in the number of startups and the growth of an active angel investing culture , there is a lot of disorganisation in the manner in which startups reach out to potential angels and , in turn , angels seek out good investment prospects . Given the expertise built with Tracxn research , we realised that we can do a significantly better job at bringing together angels and startups where angels get to see highly curated startups in upcoming sectors . Similarly , founders can choose the angels with relevant background who they think can truly add value to their companies , " says Abhishek Goyal , Co-founder of Tracxn . <h> Who are the angels ? <p> The investment process begins with the filling up a sign-up form . Once an investor signs up , the Tracxn team reaches out to verify if he/she is an accredited investor . After complete verification , one can become a part of an exclusive group of investors . <p> " Our platform will appeal to the more regular lot who are looking to invest outside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a significant amount of time to bring angels who can add a lot of value to the startups -- strategic and operational , and have not been investing as regularly now , " adds Singh . <h> What is the process ? <p> The startup fundraising process lasts over a three-day window where angels get to interact with founders digitally and offline to understand the opportunity . Investors can apply to join the process and those selected will get exclusive access to the pitch . <p> This is followed by a video presentation by the founder where investors can post their queries and get responses . Following this , investors can also set up one-to-one calls with the founders . <p> Interested investors showcase their interest with an amount and highlight the value they will add to the startup . Founders can choose which investors they want on-board and the formal agreement and documentation is taken care by Tracxn . <p> " The aim is to cut down the entire process of raising an Angel round to less than a week for startups . We want to make the investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our process will be more biased towards angels who can add a lot of value to the startups in their early building process -- strategic and operational , " shares Singh . <h> Curation is the key differentiation <p> Many online fundraising platforms have been launched to speed up the fundraising process and help startups connect to the right investor . The key differentiation that Tracxn Syndicate wants to bring is curation . <p> " Earlier angel investors were primarily investing in their network where they had the advantage of knowing the founders personally . As angels are evolving and investing outside their direct network , they need tools and research as sophisticated as that of institutional investors . Given our core competency , we thought we could build something which is significantly better than what exists in the market today , " Singh adds . <p> According to her , each of the analysts is focussed on tracking specific niche sectors . So there is a lot of effort being spent on thesis building for each vertical , and curation of startups within each sector . " Given that returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curation can play a very critical role . Also , given our bandwidth on research , we aim to provide a very high coverage on interesting startups being created in India , " she explains . <h> Expansion plans <p> The company claims to have tracked more than 10,000 technology startups in India alone and adds 50 new startups every day . <p> By the end of next year , its goal is to help more than 300 startups every year from India to raise capital through the platform . " By end of 2015 , we expect our analyst team to grow from 40 to 150 people , so one expects a lot of effort being spent around research of sectors and curation of startups . We also plan to launch in more geographies soon and you can expect us to be present in five-six interesting countries by the year end , " concludes Singh . <p> TracxnUnited States of AmericaTracxn is the research partner for Venture Capitalists and Corporate Development offices powered by the largest Startup Data platform tracking over 10m companies globally .
