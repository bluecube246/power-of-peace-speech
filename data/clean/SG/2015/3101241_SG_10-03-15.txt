Singapore Budget 2015 : Pritam Singh calls for more scrutiny on Bills in Parliament  SINGAPORE - Workers ' Party ( WP ) MP Pritam Singh ( Aljunied GRC ) called for more Bills to be sent before a Select Committee , saying this will raise awareness about legislation .  Speaking on Tuesday during the debate on the budget for Parliament , he said such committees " add much needed civility to the public discourse through the active engagement of issues ... and present a good opportunity for the Government to deepen discussions and generate greater public support for laws " .  Replying , the leader of the House , Dr Ng Eng Hen , said various Bills had been sent before such committees over the years .  Dr Ng , who is also the Defence Minister , said it was done when the Government " judged it necessary and beneficial to refer specific Bills to a Select Committee of MPs instead of the Committee of the Whole Parliament after the second reading " .  After Bills are debated , Parliament will move which MPs can go through the Bills line by line , and propose changes .  But some Bills are referred to Select committees - made up of MPs who can solicit public feedback , call witnesses , hold hearings and suggest changes to legislation - for extra scrutiny .  The last time a Bill went before such a committee was in 2004 , with the Building Maintenance and Management Bill .  Mr Singh argued that MPs ask for a Bill to be sent before a select committee when they agree with its objectives , but are " concerned about its implementation or its provisions " .  His party and the Singapore People 's Party , through its Non-constituency MP Lina Chiam , had called for two Bills to be committed to a select committee last year , he said .  Both times they were rejected as feedback garnered through the Government 's feedback channel , Reach , was " deemed to have been sufficient " , he said .  He added : " While I accept citizens have an opportunity to engage issues through the 's role in scrutinising Bills through select committees is minimised or rendered unnecessary . "  Mr Singh also said that while participating on select committees would take up more of an MP 's time , this was " rightfully so " .  Responding , Dr Ng noted the various Bills that had gone before such committees over the years . He cited nine , including the Parliamentary Elections Amendment Bill in 1988 , the Goods and Services Tax Bill in 1993 and the Advance Medical Directive Bill in 1996 .  This was to allow a smaller group to " further examine the details of implementation for complex issues or seek views from experts and other focus groups on matters related to the Bill " he said .  But he added that there are other ways to scrutinise Bills and improve on legislation .  Government agencies routinely carry out exercises to get feedback from the public before new legislation is introduced in Parliament , and the Government Parliamentary Committees also weigh in , he said .  He pointed out that many Bills introduced in Parliament have the Human Organ Transplant Amendment Bill in 2009 , the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2012 , and most recently , this year 's Liquor Control Supply and Consumption Bill .  After Bills are introduced and debated in Parliament , he added , MPs can further scrutinise the Bills during the third reading when the House moves to become a committee to do it .  Citing Nominated MP Chia Yong Yong 's proposed change to the wording of the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill during such a session last November , Dr Ng said it was a " positive example of how members in this House have contributed to improve legislation " .  " On the whole these public consultation exercises , second and third reading in this House , select committees for some Bills , have allowed the Government to obtain views from the members of the public and MPs and pass legislation in a timely and responsive manner to meet the needs of our society , " he said .
