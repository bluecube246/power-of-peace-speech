<h> Early Bird <p> The manager of an amateur football team playing in a private football tournament in India is furious with the country 's national team head coach Stephen Constantine . He is furious because Constantine recently turned down his request to allow some of the Indian internationals in his team from playing in a match of the said tournament , four days prior to India 's crucial World Cup qualifier against Turkmenistan in Ashgabat on 8 October . <p> The behaviour of the manager may sound ludicrous to you . After all , why would Constantine allow the players in his squad to play an inconsequential match in Delhi four days before a must-win game thousands of miles away in Ashgabat ? Surprisingly , the manager in question here is Brazilian football legend Roberto Carlos , who has been in top-level professional football for well over two decades , and is currently in charge of Indian Super League franchise Delhi Dynamos . <h> " Do n't want to speak about the Indian national team because of the way he spoke to me . " <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , 4 October , Roberto Carlos seemed upset at having missed the services of three of his players who had left for national team duty earlier in the day . In a lacklustre game of football which saw Delhi go down tamely away from home in Fatorda , Goa , Carlos ' team looked short of ideas throughout the 90 minutes . <p> Later on , he was asked about the three missing players in the team . " Yes I spoke to him ( Constantine ) and asked if I could keep them ( players ) . I did not like the way he spoke- at all , " he was quoted as saying by Goal.com . " I do n't want to speak about the Indian national team because of the way he spoke to me . Good luck to him , " Carlos added . <p> Earlier , Delhi Dynamos had requested the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) to allow the three Indian players to stay with the team till 5 October . The proposal was rejected by AIFF , as FIFA guidelines clearly state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least four days before international games . AIFF , however , said that they would have no problem if Constantine heeded to Dynamos ' request . <p> Constantine understandably turned down the request , with the Indians required to travel for thousands of miles for the games in Turkmenistan and Oman on 8 and 13 October , respectively . A planned training camp ahead of the two World Cup qualifying games had already been cancelled because of opposition by ISL franchises , and Constantine needed all the time he could afford with his players . <h> Carlos ' comment displays a complete lack of respect <p> There is no doubting Roberto Carlos ' status as one of the modern days greats of football . During his prime years , he went on to establish himself as one of the greatest left-backs in the sport 's history . Even as a manager , he has done relatively well during his brief stints with Anzhi Makhachkala and Sivasspor . <p> Now that he has come to India to earn his daily bread , one would expect him to at least respect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only displays a complete lack of respect for both Stephen Constantine and the Indian national team , but also shows his ignorance of the FIFA regulations , which is baffling , given his experience in the sport . <p> Perhaps the Brazilian legend could put himself on Constantine 's shoes and try to understand the other side of the story . Today Indian football stands in a very precarious position . Professional clubs are disbanding , the I-League is dying a slow death , the national team lies at 167th in the FIFA World Rankings . On top of that , the national team is robbed of a precious training camp ahead of two World Cup qualifying games away from home . <p> In such a scenario , it is probably not entirely logical to expect an amiable reply from the national team coach when you are making an irrational and unfeasible request . <h> Does ISL need to follow FIFA guidelines ? <p> ISL , although not recognised by FIFA , falls under the jurisdiction of AIFF . With AIFF directly answerable to FIFA , the ISL has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to the national team . <p> However , there seems to be a misguided sense of entitlement on the part of ISL franchises and its organisers IMG-Reliance , which is very well reflected in Robert Carlos ' statement . The fact that the stakeholders of ISL managed to highjack the national team 's preparations for the two World Cup qualifiers this month , is a stark reminder of the dangers posed by ISL to Indian football interests . <p> While preparing the schedule for the second season , the organisers of ISL completely disregarded India 's involvement in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers , holding games on the same day the Indian team plays its matches . This itself is enough to show where exactly the priorities of the organisers lie .
