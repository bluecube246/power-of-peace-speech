<p> Compared to the $1.5 billion funding raised by Internet firms Facebook in 2011 and Airbnb in June 2015 , this marks the largest private equity investment in an internet firm to date and backs up Didi Kuaidi 's claims to be a record breaking deal . <p> By comparison , Uber , its largest international competitor , has abandoned the practice of raising incrementally larger rounds and is opting to raise funds in a mixture of loans , debt funding or equity with millions to billions from banks , venture capital ( VC ) firms and large corporate internet firms . As of May 2015 , it is seeking to raise a $1.5 billion round at a valuation of $50 billion . <p> Uber entered China in 2014 and began aggressively promoting its peer-to-peer ( P2P ) tier " People 's Uber " , which is branded as UberX in the US and UberPop in some parts of Europe . This was achieved by granting massive trip bonuses to drivers , in order to acquire users and drive growth . This growth strategy provided expensive , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered China earlier than Uber , , with a significantly larger market presence in mainland Chinese cities . Didi Kuaidi owns an estimated 99 per cent market share when it comes to taxi hailing . However , Didi Kuaidi and Uber are now competing for the P2P casual chauffeur market , which remains relatively untapped and has far more potential . <p> Both are intensely marketing themselves , with claims by Uber -- of booking 1 million daily rides in China across both P2P and chauffeured services for the 13 cities it has a presence in . <p> Didi claims that Didi Shunfeng Che , its latest P2P service , is booking 600,000 daily rides across 148 cities . While significantly cheaper , that is still fewer bookings than by Uber . With this in mind , the question of who will win arises -- the international firm or the local player ? The last time a major Internet firm made a local China play was Google Inc . <p> This investment also comes amidst calls for reforms of the taxi sector in China , which has been described as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and strict market access . <p> DEALSTREETASIA is a one-stop source for the generally opaque dealscape across ASIA .
