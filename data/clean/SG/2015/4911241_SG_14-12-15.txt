cameron ' recklessly disregarded ' on eu welfare plan - mayor johnson  david cameron 's plans to curb welfare payments to eu migrants have been " recklessly disregarded " by other leaders in the bloc , an ally of the british prime minister said in an article published on monday .  london : david cameron 's plans to curb welfare payments to eu migrants have been " recklessly disregarded " by other leaders in the bloc , an ally of the british prime minister said in an article published on monday .  london mayor boris johnson , tipped as a successor to cameron , said eu leaders had to set out other ways for britain to regain control of its borders after the leader met opposition to a proposal to curb numbers of eu migrants by making workers wait four years before getting access to some welfare benefits .  officials and diplomats say the proposal would discriminate between eu citizens on national grounds , jarring with basic eu treaty law - a blow to cameron 's push to renegotiate britain 's eu ties  johnson wrote in the telegraph newspaper : " these people are radically and dangerously misreading the prime minister if they think he wants to stay in the eu at any price . the david cameron i know is much more eurosceptic than some of his senior colleagues . "  cameron has said he wants to stay in a reformed eu but rules nothing out if he can not get the changes he is seeking .  johnson said that if denmark , another eu member , could require foreign nationals to live in the country for at least five years before being allowed to buy a property , britain should also be allowed to make similar exemptions .  " the pm 's suggestion was modest , and sensible . it has been recklessly disregarded . this country could have a viable and exciting future outside the present eu arrangements . if we are going to stay , we need reform ; and if the danes can have their special circumstances recognised , so can britain , " he said .
