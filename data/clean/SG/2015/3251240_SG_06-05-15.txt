the rivals met late tuesday and talks were expected to continue wednesday , as protests continued in some areas of the capital .  bujumbura , burundi : government and opposition rivals in burundi have held talks on ending deadly demonstrations against a third term bid by the president , officials said wednesday ( may 6 ) , as international concern mounted over the crisis .  protesters have defied calls to end demonstrations , after more than a week of running battles in which over a dozen people have been killed . un refugee chief antonio guterres said he was " extremely worried " as tens of thousands fled the small central african nation .  president pierre nkurunziza , a former rebel leader from the hutu majority who has been in power since 2005 , has come under intense international pressure to withdraw from the june 26 presidential poll .  " this is a last chance meeting , they have to come up with concrete solutions so that elections can be held in acceptable conditions , " a diplomat said of the talks , deal was not struck .  us secretary of state john kerry said on monday he was " deeply concerned " about nkurunziza 's decision to stand again , which he said " flies directly in the face of the constitution " .  the rivals met late tuesday and talks were expected to continue wednesday , as protests continued in some areas of the capital .  east african foreign ministers , from neighbouring rwanda and tanzania , as well as kenya and uganda , have also arrived " to propose ways out of crisis , " foreign ministry spokesman daniel kabuto said .  clashes between rival groups took places in parts of the capital wednesday , with witnesses reporting at least two grenade explosions . burundi red cross spokesman alexis manirakiza said 16 people were wounded .  however , burundi 's foreign ministry said that " peace and security reigned " across the country , apart from " a few districts of the capital ... shaken by illegal demonstrations and violence triggered by certain political opponents . "  the meetings come after furious protesters dismissed a decision made after the court 's vice-president refused to sign the judgement and fled the country instead .  vice president prosper bazombanza has pleaded for protests to end , offering to release demonstrators who have been arrested , lift arrest warrants issued for key civil society leaders and reopen independent radio stations - provided " protests and the insurrection stop " .  ' enough crises '  a government source , speaking on condition he not be named , confirmed the government had " agreed to talk with some partners in civil society and the opposition to find a solution " . but one of leaders of the campaign against nkurunziza 's third term said they were doubtful the talks would result in a deal .  " i 'm afraid we wo n't succeed - because the government does not want to discuss the third mandate of nkurunziza , and this issue is non-negotiable for us , " he said , asking not be named .  burundi , where a 13-year civil war between tutsis and hutus ended only in 2006 , has been rocked by violent critics say is in defiance of the constitution and the arusha accords which ended the war .  nkurunziza 's supporters say he is eligible to run again since his first term in office followed his election by parliament - not directly by the people as the constitution specifies .  last week the east african community ( eac ) - the five-nation bloc that includes burundi - warned leaders to " ensure that the electoral process does not lead to humanitarian crisis " . over 30,000 burundians have already fled into neighbouring nations , mainly into rwanda .  unhcr chief antonio guterres , speaking in nairobi , said he was " extremely worried " at the political crisis .  " we thought burundian refugees were something we would never have to discuss again , unfortunately we are back to having a significant outflow of burundians , " guterres told reporters . " it must stop . we have enough crises in the world . "  rwanda has warned burundi it must protect civilians saying it was concerned at " reports " violence was linked to ethnic hutu ( fdlr ) , who fled rwanda into democratic republic of congo after the 1994 genocide of mainly tutsi people there .  rwanda has previously sent troops into dr congo to target the rebels .  burundi 's foreign ministry dismissed the reports , saying such forces would not be " tolerated on burundian territory .
