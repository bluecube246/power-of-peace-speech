<p> PRAGUE - The Czech prime minister criticized the country 's president , Milos Zeman , on Monday for instigating a public spat with the U.S. ambassador , saying he wished the president was more professional in diplomatic affairs . <p> On Sunday , Zeman told a local news site he had " closed the door " of his official residence to U.S. Ambassador Andrew Schapiro following the envoy 's comments the president perceived as critical of his decision to attend a World War Two commemoration in Moscow in May . <p> European Union leaders are boycotting the ceremony over what they say is Russia 's role in the conflict in Ukraine but Zeman - who has frequently departed from the EU line and criticized sanctions against Moscow - has said he would attend . <p> Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka made clear his view that it was crucial for the security of the former Soviet-bloc nation to remain in lock step with NATO and the EU . <p> " I would of course welcome if Mr. President 's approach to foreign policy and diplomacy in general was somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . <p> The Czech presidency is largely a ceremonial role but Zeman - who was the first president directly elected when he took office in 2013 - has frequently drawn the ire of government leaders for his public comments on domestic and foreign affairs . <p> Sobotka said Zeman reacted disproportionately to the U.S. envoy 's comments . <p> Schapiro had told Czech television it would be " awkward " if Zeman attended the ceremony as the only statesmen from an EU country . He later said he had no intention of telling a foreign statesman where to travel . <p> " I understand the desire to honor all who sacrificed in World War Two , but I think it would be unfortunate for President Zeman to be there as perhaps ? the only EU head of state , watching a military parade , at a time when Russian troops are destabilizing a neighbor in violation of international law , " Schapiro said in a statement . <p> " I regret that President Zeman was offended by that ; as someone who claims to value blunt talk , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeman , a former prime minister , has frequently departed from the common EU line on Ukraine and has criticized sanctions against Moscow . The government , which is responsible for foreign policy , however , has held the EU line fully . <p> Moscow has backed the rebels in eastern Ukraine but denies Western accusations that it provides them with money , arms and troops .
