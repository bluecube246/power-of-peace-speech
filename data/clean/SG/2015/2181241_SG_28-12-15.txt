<h> Archive <h> Search This Section <p> Keyword <p> SINGAPORE banks are set to close 2015 with their shares down 15-20 per cent from the start of the year , as concerns of slow growth in the Republic and the region outweigh hopes of gains from higher interest rates and fee income . <p> One indicator is bank lending in Singapore .

Fitch ranked the Singapore lenders " stable " in the outlook for both their ratings and the overall sector . <p> " A key risk lies in banks ' exposure to the commodity sector , which has been hit by low commodity prices . We expect modest risk from this sector , given Singapore banks ' diversified loan portfolios and steady asset-quality track record , " it added . <p> Nomura is also sanguine , noting that concerns over the Singapore banks ' exposure to China and commodity are overblown . It noted that risks have been manageable , and the credit costs have not been significant . <p> Meanwhile , the three-month Singapore interbank offered rate ( Sibor ) - of which many floating-rate mortgages are based - has more than doubled this year . " We expect loan growth to be modest at 5 per cent year-on-year but we think earnings could grow at 12 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Both DBS Group Holdings and United Overseas Bank ( UOB ) have lost about 20 per cent in stock price since the start of the year , with DBS closing at S$16.65 on Monday and UOB at S$19.44 . <p> Shares in Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation ( OCBC ) - which earlier suffered from an overhang over its Wing Hang purchase - have fallen about 15 per cent , standing at S$8.82 on Monday . <p> Bank stocks have been a drag on the benchmark index , with the Straits Times Index down about 15 per cent since the start of the year .
