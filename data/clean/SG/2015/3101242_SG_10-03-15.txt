Singapore Budget 2015 : New library at Punggol ; upgrades to four existing libraries  SINGAPORE - A new library , the Punggol Regional Library , will be built over the next five years , along with upgrades to four existing libraries , said Minister of State for Communications and Information Sim Ann on Tuesday in Parliament .  " The National Library Board is embarking on a masterplan that charts the expansion and development of the library network for the next decade , " said Ms Sim during the debate on the Ministry of Communications and Information annual budget .  " Some libraries that are exceptionally popular will be expanded . This is necessary as library visitors are expected to grow and more space is needed , " she said .  For example , the Pasir Ris library at White Sands mall will be expanded and refurbished . A dedicated teen space , which will have a " chillax lifestyle " theme , will also be set up at the library .  The new Tampines Regional Library , relocated to the upcoming Tampines to help combine learning through reading and practice of culinary art .  The Bedok Public library will be relocated to the Bedok Integrated Complex , while the Bukit Panjang library at Bukit Panjang Plaza will be expanded .
