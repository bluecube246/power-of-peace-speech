<p> Each site is equipped with a 2 kW off-grid system that is now operational and is providing its occupants with access to electricity . The school is located in Phongasavang and the health clinic is located in Lad Khammune . <p> Personnel from these organisations supported the laying of electrical wiring and installation of lights , fans and solar system . For social work volunteers , it was a component of their social voluntary program , with a similar solar power project conducted last year at another rural school in Lad Khammune . <p> The Phongsavang and Lad Khammune communities were chosen by the YMCA of Singapore for these projects , as the municipal authorities of the area were not in a position to facilitate electrical supply during the next five years . Solar panels , system equipment , installers and manpower were transported five hours by boat from Luang Prabang to this remote location . <p> The Ban Phongsavang school has over 120 students who will benefit from the clean energy system , which will provide lights for the night classes and fans for cooling classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into educational lessons and enrich the learning experiences for students in these schools . <p> The Lad Khammune Health centre serves the medical needs of seven surrounding villages , serving approximately 3000 people . The access to solar energy will allow the health centre to extend its operating hours and facilitate a more comfortable environment for patients via fan use . <p> Angie Koh , managing director of Yingli Singapore and Southeast Asia operations , said " It was a pleasure to once again partner with such strong organisations and successfully bring solar power to these rural communities . The project is reflective of Yingli 's larger efforts to improve the lives of communities around the world with clean , affordable solar power .
