<h> TOPICS <h> E is for Evolution : The next stage of LTE <h> E is for Evolution : The next stage of LTE <p> LTE has reached mainstream status with over half of the world 's operators already running live commercial LTE services - over 420 , according to the latest numbers from the Global mobile Suppliers Association ( GSA ) . But with mobile data traffic continuing to surge exponentially , cellcos are already looking towards the next stage of 4G evolution to meet upcoming demands . <p> We 've already seen plenty of buzz this year over " 5G , " which is n't a straight technology upgrade but more of a technology concept incorporating multiple technologies that will work together to deliver ubiquitous and dynamic capacity anywhere and anytime to everyone and everything . <p> But 5G wo n't replace LTE , which will evolve in its own right and serve as linchpin holding various 5G technologies together . That 's essential - first-generation LTE offers vast improvements in capacity , modulation and spectral efficiency over 3G , but it 's still not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boost data rates , add capacity and maximize use of spectrum . <h> See Also <p> That 's where LTE-Advanced comes in . A number of operators are already moving to the next stage with LTE-A - the GSA counts close to 90 commercially launched LTE-A networks as of August 2015 - with a particular focus on carrier aggregation ( CA ) . <p> But there 's much more to LTE-A than that . The 3GPP has number of technological tools in the LTE-A toolbox for cellcos to take their networks to the next level . Operators that have not yet deployed LTE-A or are still in 3.5G mode must take stock of that toolbox as they plan their evolution strategies . <p> Carrier aggregation . Of the tools currently available for LTE-A , the most talked about at the moment is CA , which allows cellcos to combine up to five Release 8-compatible carriers to increase transmission bandwidth and boost downlink data rates . Aggregated carriers can be adjacent or non-adjacent at different frequency bands to include FDD and TDD bands . Currently up to two bands can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Release 12 together with Cat 9 handsets reportedly supports up to 60 MHz worth of bandwidth aggregation delivering peak downlink rates of up to 450 Mbps . <p> There have already been high-profile deployments and trials of CA technologies in Korea , where SK Telecom , LG U+ , and KT have launched commercial LTE-A with three aggregated carriers . As of August 2015 , the GSA estimates that 20% of all LTE operators have already launched LTE-A with CA in various combinations . <p> Advanced MIMO . Today 's LTE networks are usually running on 2x2 MIMO ( i.e. the base station uses two transmit-and-receive antennas , although current Release 8 devices only transmit with one antenna while receiving with two antennas ) . With LTE-A , cellcos can deploy higher MIMO configurations such as 4x4 and 8x8 , which generally promises increased cell throughput and enhanced user throughput . <p> Higher order modulation . Release 12 allows for 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation ( QAM ) in the downlink , which can increase data rates by a factor of 1.3 compared to 64QAM - according to Nokia Networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 256QAM yielded 390 Mbps on 40 MHz of aggregated spectrum . Ericsson recently announced its own demo in which 256QAM was combined with CA to produce peak downlink data speeds of up to 600 Mbps , while boosting the uplink modulation scheme from 16QAM to 64QAM provides a 50% increase in uplink data speeds . <p> Coordinated Multi Point ( CoMP ) . This component aims to improve the network performance at the cell edge by leveraging the connectivity of the device to two or more cells and coordinating inter-cell interference . CoMP can be applied to uplink or downlink transmissions . UL CoMP is particularly useful for " mass event scenarios " for dense multi-cell deployments ( stadium events , for example ) , with cell edge performance gains for UL transmissions potentially exceeding 200% to 300% , while DL CoMP can realize performance gains at the cell edge of up to 50% . <p> Heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) . This involves macro and small cell deployments spread across multiple radio access technologies ( mainly Wi-Fi , LTE , and 3G ) . Release 8 supports features to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interworking and traffic steering between different layers , technologies and domains .
