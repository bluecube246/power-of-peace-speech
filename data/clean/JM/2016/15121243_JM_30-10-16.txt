<h> News <h> Accolades galore in regal farewell to Brian George <p> " My father was a man who could , in the words of Rudyard Kipling , talk with crowds and keep his virtue , or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch , " Christopher George , Brian George 's older son , said in his tribute at the service of thanksgiving for his father yesterday . <p> This was evident by the fact that individuals from all walks of life filled the St Andrew Parish Church in Half-Way-Tree to pay their last respects to the late business mogul who died suddenly last Sunday after suffering a heart attack . <p> Current and former members of Government and the Opposition , including Prime Minister Andrew Holness , former Prime Minister PJ Patterson , former Minister of Finance Dr Peter Phillips , Cabinet ministers and members of the public and private sectors packed into the church to celebrate George 's life and his contribution to Jamaica . <p> Christopher , in relating an excerpt from a letter to the family written by Patterson , noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's truly amazing that one who lived and worked in Jamaica for 30 years has left such an indelible impression on our national landscape . Since the arrival of Brian George here as president and CEO of Supreme Ventures Limited ( SVL ) , his energy and superb managerial talent extended well beyond the development of a corporate enterprise to embrace dedicated service to all members of our sporting organisations and several of our country 's institutions , " George related in his tribute from Patterson 's letter to the family . <p> The former president of SVL was also described as a compassionate individual who made an effort to assist all he could . <p> " Daddy left a lasting impression on everyone , " Christopher stated . " There was never a problem too small for my daddy to solve . He was so generous with giving his time and energy ; friends and family often saw a different side -- soft , kinder and a comedian . When I asked many about how you met my father it often involved him telling you a joke , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement . <p> " He was our king ... he made us feel safe no matter how far we ventured , and allowed us freedom to explore and discover , and was always there to give advice and subtly guide us in the right direction , " Christopher remembered . <p> A torn Matthew George -- his younger son -- remembered his father as a friend and mentor . <p> " My father was the most loyal friend , as many of you all know . This made him the consummate social worker , always smiling , always ready to have conversation and openly talk ; he really had the gift of that , whether serious business or ' old talk ' as the Trinis say , " he noted . <p> Though a talker , Matthew quickly pointed out that his father was also " always willing to listen " . <p> " My father lost his father at the young age of 17 and always indicated that he would have loved to have more time with him , so my brother and I are totally thankful that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our dad . We do feel that one more minute would have changed our lives , but are grateful for the time we had with him , " he said in-between sniffles . <p> " Brian possessed a most brilliant mind , a mind grounded in arithmetic , science and logic , but expanded by literature , poetry , prose and a breathtaking mental agility . The quickness and speed of his mind was Bolt-like . <p> " Brian was one of those very rare human beings who had an intellectual breadth and depth that was awesome , yet he was neither pompous nor arrogant with this supremacy . He would engage in discussions on any topic , with anyone , at any time . He respected all views even if he strongly disagreed with them , such was the character of the man , " stated Scott with pride . <p> Matthew and Christopher both expressed gratitude to Jamaicans who embraced and supported their father -- a Trinidadian . <p> " I would like to thank Keneea , especially , that my dad was able to find someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and thin you were there , " Matthew said of George 's widow just before he broke down in tears . <p> The ashes of Brian George will be inurned on a date to be decided . The 59-year-old was serving as president and CEO of SVL when he died . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 . We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day .
