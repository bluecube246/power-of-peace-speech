News  36 years after  Friends , 36 years ago today , Jamaicans had a sigh of relief as the bloody ( 4 ) election campaign finally ended with a big victory for the green ( 16 ) party .  I know that some do n't want to remember those dark days , but it was that sad period in the 1970s to 1980 that saw hundreds dead ( 3 ) , houses burnt ( 2 ) and the distribution of guns ( 27 ) to the youth that caused the political division that led to the creation of these big ( 33 ) exclusive zones called garrisons .  A whole heap a people had to pack their belongings in small ( 10 ) trucks and vans and take flight . Then the political police ( 13 ) did not help the situation .  I am happy that there have been positive changes in the electoral system that put an end to the madness . But , sadly , Jamaica is still paying the price . Is n't it sad ? We were violence set us back forever .  Anyway , as the struggle continues for a better life , you walk good until such time .  ADVERTISEMENT  POST A COMMENT  HOUSE RULES  1 .
