news  36 years after  friends , 36 years ago today , jamaicans had a sigh of relief as the bloody ( 4 ) election campaign finally ended with a big victory for the green ( 16 ) party .  i know that some do n't want to remember those dark days , but it was that sad period in the 1970s to 1980 that saw hundreds dead ( 3 ) , houses burnt ( 2 ) and the distribution of guns ( 27 ) to the youth that caused the political division that led to the creation of these big ( 33 ) exclusive zones called garrisons .  a whole heap a people had to pack their belongings in small ( 10 ) trucks and vans and take flight . then the political police ( 13 ) did not help the situation .  i am happy that there have been positive changes in the electoral system that put an end to the madness . but , sadly , jamaica is still paying the price . is n't it sad ? we were violence set us back forever .  anyway , as the struggle continues for a better life , you walk good until such time .  advertisement  post a comment  house rules  1 . we welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day . some comments may be republished on the website or in the newspaper -- email addresses will not be published .  2 . please understand that comments are moderated and it is not always possible to publish all that have been submitted . we will , however , try to publish comments that are representative of all received .  3 . we ask that comments are civil and free of libellous or hateful material . also please stick to the topic under discussion .  4 . please do not write in block capitals since this makes your comment hard to read .
