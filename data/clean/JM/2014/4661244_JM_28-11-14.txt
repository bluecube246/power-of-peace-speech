doctor 's advice:defeating premature ejaculation  q. hello . i 'm a guy of 20 , and i have been having a serious problem of late . you see , i have been masturbating from quite a young age ( maybe 14 ) , and i think i 'm now a ' premature ejaculation ' patient . doc , i would love you to help me in any way you can - preferably suggesting a form of medication that would help me with my problem . it is causing difficulties in my relationship .  a. i 'm sure it is . premature ejaculation ( pe ) makes having satisfactory sex very difficult . it makes women feel frustrated , and it has wrecked many young people 's romantic relationships .  let me just get that business of masturbation out of the way . as i have stated in this column before , the only way in which masturbation can harm your sex life is if you get in the habit of doing it very quickly . that tends to kind of ' condition ' a lead to premature ejaculation .  so if you are still masturbating , you should take care to do it only slowly , always making sure that you do not climax in less than 15 minutes . experts say that this ' re-trains ' a guy , so that he starts to feel in control of his own orgasms .  now , today , at the age of 20 , you are in a relationship with a young woman and are trying to have successful sex with her . but you say that you think that you are a premature ejaculator .  are you really ? if you can ' last ' for 10 or 15 minutes , then you are not . but if you find yourself accidentally climaxing after only a minute or two inside the young lady , then you definitely are .  so if you have pe , what can be done about it ? well , in my view , the two best ways of defeating it are :  the ' stop-start ' technique ;  the masters-johnson squeeze grip .  , but essentially , they are ways of helping a guy to get full mental control of his ejaculations so that he does n't have to discharge until he is really ready to do so .  now , you ask me to suggest a form of medication . that is quite tricky because there is actually no medication that will genuinely cure a guy 's pe .  however , there are quite a few medications that a man can use that will ' delay ' him on that particular day . they are :  antidepressant drugs : some doctors in jamaica will prescribe these pills to guys with pe because of the fact that certain antidepressants make it difficult to reach a climax . the one that is most frequently prescribed is called anafranil ( also known as clomipramine ) . please bear in mind that its effect lasts only for a day or so , and it does have side effects .  dapoxetine is a drug which is related to the antidepressants . the idea is that you take it two or three hours before sex , dizziness , and ' operations ' . there are now some pharmacies in jamaica that will obtain it for you , but it is expensive .  local anaesthetic creams and sprays : the idea is that you put them on your penis before sex , thus dulling the sensation you feel . that sounds like a great idea , but there can be problems . first , you may develop a painful ' sensitivity reaction ' to the drug .  second , the local anaesthetic may dull your partner 's sensation , too ! and it could give her a sensitivity reaction .  condoms containing local anaesthetic : these are slightly preferable , in my view , because at least the local anaesthetic is inside , so it is unlikely to affect the girl . to find out more , type the words ' long-last condoms ' , on google .  i wish you well , young man !  q. doc , last week i had sex with a guy for the first time in my life , and i did not enjoy it at it hurt me a little and i was slightly sore for the next few days . it certainly as was n't exciting as i had expected . what does all this mean , doctor ? am i , perhaps , a lesbian ?  a. i very much doubt it . like a lot of young women , you have now discovered that ' first sex ' is n't as wonderful as it 's alleged to be .  often , it is painful , damp , and frustrating . very frequently , it is over before you know that you 've started !  but cheer up ! in some years from now , when you have established a loving relationship with a guy who knows what he is doing , you will find sex a delightful experience .  just at this moment , there are two things i would like you to remember :  1 . you may be pregnant , so if your menses do n't arrive , please do a pregnancy test ;  2 . the guy may have given you chlamydia , or any doubt , go and get yourself tested for stis.
