CWC company acquires small wifi rival DEKAL  LIME Jamaica announced the acquisition of DEKAL Wireless , an Internet service provider whose services are mainly focused on rural Jamaicans , but declined to identify the specific buyer , said only to be " a member of the CWC Group " .  LIME , which is owned by Cable &amp; Wireless Communications Plc , will take over operation of the business immediately , even while the deal to purchase the shares of DEKAL 's parent awaits regulatory approval .  The acquisition price was not disclosed , because DEKAL is a private company , LIME Jamaica said . The purchase comes amid the pending merger of CWC and Columbus International , which , too , is awaiting regulatory approval across several Caribbean markets .  DEKAL , which is run by CEO David Lee , offers wireless broadband services out of Port Antonio .  The acquisition gives LIME an additional 15,000 customers served by DEKAL , but LIME indicated to Wednesday Business that it would now be able to deli-ver service to more than 10 times " The value of the business is equal to our capability to deliver wireless high-speed broadband Internet service to at least another 200,000 persons in rural Jamaica , " the telecom said last night .  " This is a unique opportunity for LIME to connect more Jamaicans and play our part in bringing Jamaica 's Internet penetration level to global standards . This initiative ensures that no one is left behind as we move towards becoming a more connected society , " said LIME Jamaica CEO Gary Sinclair in a joint press release on the acquisition .  DEKAL Wireless utilises SuperWi-Fi technology to deliver service nationally . Its business model and market strategy were built on servicing areas of Jamaica that the big telecoms do not or where network penetration is low .
