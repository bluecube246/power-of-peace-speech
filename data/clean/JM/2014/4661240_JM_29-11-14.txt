Put Privy Council to referendum

<h> Put Privy Council to referendum <p> In 1970 , the Jamaica Labour Party ( JLP ) formed the Government of Jamaica . At a regional heads of government meeting , the JLP Government proposed the Caribbean Court of Justice ( CCJ ) . There was conceived the organisation that has continued to occupy our thoughts and generate conflicting opinions to this day . It was , however , not the first proposal that we leave the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the UK . <p> On April 16 , 2005 , the CCJ was born and took up residence at 134 Henry Street , Port-of-Spain , Trinidad . For the CCJ to have substance , 14 countries , including Jamaica , contributed to the trust fund that assures the financial viability of the CCJ . Jamaica paid in US$27 million . Only Trinidad and Tobago paid more , some US$29 million . <p> There has been the argument made that this court reflects ' us ' - this mythical being called the Caribbean person - yet , from its inception , this has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ' foreigners ' sitting on the court . The irony of trumpeting the necessity to leave the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is that the CCJ is part foreign-leaning and does not understand life in Jamaica . <p> David Hayton , a judge , one of seven , is from the UK . Jacob Wit , a judge , is from the Netherlands Antilles . The court did not , in 2005 , have a Jamaican jurist on the panel . It has one now . Imagine , Jamaica paid more than 25 per cent of its cost and had no representation . CARICOM certainly made it clear from day one that it did not need us , but needed our money . <p> STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT <p> The court is structurally deficient . What recourse is open to an aggrieved party where the court , in its original jurisdiction , rules and the defaulting state refuses to enforce the decision of the CCJ ? Answers ? NONE ! Haiti and Suriname are civil-law jurisprudence . How will it be all right to stretch the jurisprudence of this court to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as Haiti and Suriname ? Grenada and Antigua &amp; Barbuda must have a referendum to make the final decision . Others have super majorities of their Parliament as the final arbiter . Trinidad has announced it will have a referendum . Jamaica is having the debate . <p> The PNP administration has a phobia of referenda . The events of 1961 gave rise to this . However , the old dear departed of the PNP has left an infection which accounts for its fear of a politicised referendum for Jamaica . All referenda are politicised . This is particularly pronounced in cases where the competing political forces align to different sides of the referendum question . <p> Currently , we have the PNP stating that money is an issue for us to establish our own final appellate court . Does this imply that the Jamaican economy does not have real prospects for growth and viability to afford an instrument of national significance ? Let the people decide . <p> NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT <p> We are nominally independent , and at the time of Independence , we deferred the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must move forward with full independence , not southward to Port-of-Spain and Georgetown . We have been forced-fed this CARICOM drivel . Notice , it has not benefited us . Trinidad breaches the rules regarding the origin for petroleum products , the single largest dollar value of our imports from them , yet that republic ignores attempts at resolution . They forget the money rather than engage . They treat Jamaica with scant regard . <p> I declare that I am totally anti-CARICOM . I want to see its final and total demise . Do not respond with the red herring that small island states can not survive alone in this geopolitical world . I never said we would go it alone . Just not go with CARICOM . <p> I am prepared to take the fight to the diaspora . I want the people to say , once and for all , if they want to be governed in Jamaica or Georgetown , or Port-of-Spain . You were handed a CARICOM Community passport . You were assessed a charge for the court . You have been refused entry and deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of being major contributor of crime in Trinidad , and the breaking up of relationships among individuals in Barbados . <p> Let the people decide . <p> I am a democrat . The collective wisdom of my people will be sufficient for me to fall in line if the CCJ is approved . I will be a most vigorous opponent at this stage . Let the people decide . <p> The British have hinted that we should leave the Privy Council . Let us , in response , set a timetable for the creation and funding of a reserve for a Jamaican final appellate court , should it be five or 10 years . <p> Set the date for the referendum . Put the sole question to the electorate : Let the voice of the people be heard . Have faith in the collective decision . This is my plea to Portia Simpson Miller and the reluctant PNP . Have some pride in Jamaican sovereignty .
