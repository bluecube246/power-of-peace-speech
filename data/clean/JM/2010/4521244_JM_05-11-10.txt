Cocktail dress code  Cocktail attire means short , elegant dresses for the woman and dark suits for the man . Here 's how contributor Chris Bank describes the code for cocktail dressing as was intentioned for the evening with Mr Clinton during his visit last week .  Cocktail dress is usually required for evening events more than daytime ones , and the evening cocktail attire is quite distinct from other evening attire . Although the categories of attire for evening social .  In defining cocktail dress , Bank refers to it as dress-up attire for social occasions like holiday parties to singles get-togethers . Cocktail dress is sometimes referred to as ' creative black tie ' . Accessories , women 's hairstyles and jewellery for cocktail dress are typically more flashy and distinctive than for other types of dress-up attire .  Men : The cocktail dress for the men is similar to semi-formal attire . However , the differences are that semi-formal attire is a suit or jacket , often with a vest , and a tie ; while cocktail attire for men consists of a jacket with or without a tie , and slacks . Cocktail attire for men is usually more fashion-forward , and with bolder colours and patterns than semi-formal attire , which calls for tuxedos or morning coats . If an occasion calls for cocktail attire , formal attire should not be worn . You leave yourself to be ridiculed if you wear a tuxedo or a floor-length dress . .  Women : Cocktail dress for women creates more appeal to the opposite sex than the knee but above floor length .

Changshan - a long male version of the qipao . It can be cotton for ordinary wear , or silk for those within aristocratic families . Beneath the changshan , the male generally wears white mandarin-collar , long-sleeved shirt and a pair of dark-coloured long pants . Like the qipao , this changshan male gown has slits on both sides ( at least knee level ) as well . It is worn nowadays either by Chinese men in the martial arts world , or as attire for weddings to match the qipao the bride wears .
