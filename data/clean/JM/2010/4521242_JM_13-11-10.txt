courting local wood furniture makers  in any home , elegant wood furniture is functional and makes it inviting .  jamaicans , known for their hospitality the world over , as well as their creativity , have expressed these two traits through their craftsanship for the home . for centuries , jamaican artisans have excelled at providing items that are creative , distinctive , unique , and durable .  to this day , these artisans are described by manufacturers and retailers alike as naturally gifted craftsmen .  courts jamaica limited managing director hayden singh recalls that decades ago , jamaican mahogany furniture - the heritage range - could be found in leading retailers in the united kingdom such as john lewis and debenhams .  today , signature distinctive jamaican pieces are found in local homes , antique stores , from individual furniture makers , and from courts , the largest retailer of locally made furniture nationwide .  catering to the typical jamaican consumer , courts provides a full range of furniture options for the home . wherever they operate , it is economic activity .  in jamaica , the dynamics of the local furniture industry have made courts far more than just a retailer .  the company starts very early in the value chain supporting training and apprenticeship programmes and providing scholarships for artisans to get the best training .  these are , for example , the manufacturers apprentice devel-opment programme and junior management programme .  bulk buying  to assist with procurement of materials , courts undertakes bulk buying and sells to manufacturers at cost .  working closely with manufacturers , courts has brought canadian executive services overseas to jamaica for knowledge sharing on finishing techniques , effective use of materials , and operational efficiency .  courts ' buyers visit factories and work with the 30-plus individual manufacturers to ensure they meet quality standards with respect to raw materials used and the method of construction . quality-control measures are undertaken upon receipt as courts may randomly strip down furniture as well .  when it comes time for payment , courts pays within days of being invoiced , rather than the customary 30- 60- or 90-day 29 locations nationwide , courts provides direct employment for 1,000 persons and another 2,500 contracted persons .  throughout the recession , courts has had no redundancies , and in fact , courts has hired additional staff beyond filling positions left vacant through attrition .  improved experience  the stores have been recently redesigned to improve the retailing experience for customers , and expansion is under way for the bogue store in montego bay , as well as the savanna-la-mar and falmouth locations .  overseas , the company has successfully opened the first location in new york for jamaicans to buy furniture for family and friends here . expansion will be determined by diaspora demand .  but with all this support to manufacturing and retail expansion , singh notes that sales of locally made items have declined from 80 per cent of total sales to about 60-65 per cent .  why ? because with globalisation , it is challenging for local products to compete effectively on price , and moreover , globalisation has brought a change in consumer taste preferences .  which leads us to the the challenges of globalisation ? singh will tell you yes .  having made a us$200-million investment , the el salvadorean parent , known for buying local whenever invested , is here for long term .  the manufacturers will also tell  you yes . in fact , singh believes export potential is possible , and he should know , with courts ' reach with 400 stores in central america and the caribbean .  how can jamaica capitalise on opportunities to truly develop a viable furniture industry to continuously supply a global retailer like courts ? industry experts suggest a public-private partnership could be created to enable the private sector to invest in the sector , with necessary equipment to enable economies of scale .  sharing of equipment maximises utilisation and allows for recouping the investment for that equipment .  eliminate problems  currently unutilised empty government-owned factories could be converted to incubators providing the infrastructure to house various manufacturers who could share the equipment required to make commercial quantities and items that can be flat-packed for export .  with a public-private partnership , demand could to the market could better identify what the consumer wants and would pay for .  with greater assurance of markets and pooled resources , there can be better scheduling to eliminate the problem of missed deadlines - a perennial problem in a fragmented industry long on talent but short on resources .  as for changing consumer preferences , there are a few jamaican contract manufacturers who do produce to meet these tastes . different wood types - teak , cedar , wild tamarind , jatoba , and more modern designs can be found in leading hotels in jamaica and exported to the caribbean .  customised and unique . for indoor and outdoor . and all could easily stand tall in the finest international periodicals of home design and decor .  jamaica 's competitive advantage in creativity is evident in the work of our gifted craftsmen . with a partnership , this advantage could result in steady employment and increased growth potential for jamaica .  deika morrison is managing director of mdk advisory &amp; consulting limited . she is compiling a catalogue of jamaican-made products and support @ @ @
