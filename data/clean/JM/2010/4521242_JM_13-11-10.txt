<h> Courting local wood furniture makers <p> In any home , elegant wood furniture is functional and makes it inviting . <p> Jamaicans , known for their hospitality the world over , as well as their creativity , have expressed these two traits through their craftsanship for the home . For centuries , Jamaican artisans have excelled at providing items that are creative , distinctive , unique , and durable . <p> To this day , these artisans are described by manufacturers and retailers alike as naturally gifted craftsmen . <p> Courts Jamaica Limited Managing Director Hayden Singh recalls that decades ago , Jamaican mahogany furniture - the Heritage range - could be found in leading retailers in the United Kingdom such as John Lewis and Debenhams . <p> Today , signature distinctive Jamaican pieces are found in local homes , antique stores , from individual furniture makers , and from Courts , the largest retailer of locally made furniture nationwide . <p> Catering to the typical Jamaican consumer , Courts provides a full range of furniture options for the home . Wherever they operate , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic activity . <p> In Jamaica , the dynamics of the local furniture industry have made Courts far more than just a retailer . <p> The company starts very early in the value chain supporting training and apprenticeship programmes and providing scholarships for artisans to get the best training . <p> These are , for example , the Manufacturers Apprentice Devel-opment Programme and Junior Management Programme . <p> bulk buying <p> To assist with procurement of materials , Courts undertakes bulk buying and sells to manufacturers at cost . <p> Working closely with manufacturers , Courts has brought Canadian Executive Services Overseas to Jamaica for knowledge sharing on finishing techniques , effective use of materials , and operational efficiency . <p> Courts ' buyers visit factories and work with the 30-plus individual manufacturers to ensure they meet quality standards with respect to raw materials used and the method of construction . Quality-control measures are undertaken upon receipt as Courts may randomly strip down furniture as well . <p> When it comes time for payment , Courts pays within days of being invoiced , rather than the customary 30- 60- or 90-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 locations nationwide , Courts provides direct employment for 1,000 persons and another 2,500 contracted persons . <p> Throughout the recession , Courts has had no redundancies , and in fact , Courts has hired additional staff beyond filling positions left vacant through attrition . <p> improved experience <p> The stores have been recently redesigned to improve the retailing experience for customers , and expansion is under way for the Bogue store in Montego Bay , as well as the Savanna-la-Mar and Falmouth locations . <p> Overseas , the company has successfully opened the first location in New York for Jamaicans to buy furniture for family and friends here . Expansion will be determined by diaspora demand . <p> But with all this support to manufacturing and retail expansion , Singh notes that sales of locally made items have declined from 80 per cent of total sales to about 60-65 per cent . <p> Why ? Because with globalisation , it is challenging for local products to compete effectively on price , and moreover , globalisation has brought a change in consumer taste preferences . <p> Which leads us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenges of globalisation ? Singh will tell you yes . <p> Having made a US$200-million investment , the El Salvadorean parent , known for buying local whenever invested , is here for long term . <p> The manufacturers will also tell <p> you yes . In fact , Singh believes export potential is possible , and he should know , with Courts ' reach with 400 stores in Central America and the Caribbean . <p> How can Jamaica capitalise on opportunities to truly develop a viable furniture industry to continuously supply a global retailer like Courts ? Industry experts suggest a public-private partnership could be created to enable the private sector to invest in the sector , with necessary equipment to enable economies of scale . <p> Sharing of equipment maximises utilisation and allows for recouping the investment for that equipment . <p> eliminate problems <p> Currently unutilised empty government-owned factories could be converted to incubators providing the infrastructure to house various manufacturers who could share the equipment required to make commercial quantities and items that can be flat-packed for export . <p> With a public-private partnership , demand could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the market could better identify what the consumer wants and would pay for . <p> With greater assurance of markets and pooled resources , there can be better scheduling to eliminate the problem of missed deadlines - a perennial problem in a fragmented industry long on talent but short on resources . <p> As for changing consumer preferences , there are a few Jamaican contract manufacturers who do produce to meet these tastes . Different wood types - teak , cedar , wild tamarind , jatoba , and more modern designs can be found in leading hotels in Jamaica and exported to the Caribbean . <p> Customised and unique . For indoor and outdoor . And all could easily stand tall in the finest international periodicals of home design and decor . <p> Jamaica 's competitive advantage in creativity is evident in the work of our gifted craftsmen . With a partnership , this advantage could result in steady employment and increased growth potential for Jamaica . <p> Deika Morrison is managing director of Mdk Advisory &amp; Consulting Limited .
