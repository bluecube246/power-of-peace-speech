Psychiatric nurses in Ghana strike over dangerous working environment  In a statement issued by their chairperson , Jamilatu Hussein , the nurses at the Accra Psychiatric Hospital said they were compelled to put their safety above patient care .  This , they said , was after several fruitless attempts to get a lasting solution to the problems that had persisted at the hospital for years , thus exposing both patients and staff to high risks of infection .  They said as a result of the shortage of essential medications required for psychiatric management , most patients had relapsed , with many of them demonstrating serious aggressive behaviors towards staff and other patients .  These physical assaults have resulted in varying degrees of injury and disability , spreading fear and panic among the staff and even the patients to the extent that the focus now was on staff protection rather than patient care .  " Effective Monday 31st October 2016 , no nurse will subject him/herself to the danger posed by the workplace until such a time when we have reasonable cause to the nurses ' statement .  The psychiatric hospital in September shut down its outpatient department due to financial challenges .  Meanwhile , Chief Executive Officer of the hospital Dr. Pinaman Appau has told local media that several attempts to address the facility 's challenges had failed .
