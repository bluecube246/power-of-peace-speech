<h> Power crisis cost Ghana $3 billion -- Bawumia <p> The running-mate of the opposition New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , Dr Mahamudu Bawumia , has claimed that Ghana lost over $3 billion to the power crisis ( ' Dumsor ' ) , which rocked the nation between 2011 and 2015 . <p> According to him , the power crisis led to the loss of many jobs and even caused the death of some Ghanaians . <p> Dr Bawumia , who was speaking on Accra-based Joy FM on Tuesday , disagreed with President John Mahama 's assertion that his administration engineered the fastest mobilisation of emergency power of 820 megawatts in the country 's recent history . <p> The NPP bigwig said the President did not deserve praise for the prevailing stable electricity because it was his government which inflicted ' dumsor ' on Ghanaians in the first place through what he termed bad economic and financial management of the economy . <p> Dr Bawumia said the current stability in power supply was due to temporary solutions the government put in place at high cost .
