power crisis cost ghana $3 billion -- bawumia  the running-mate of the opposition new patriotic party ( npp ) , dr mahamudu bawumia , has claimed that ghana lost over $3 billion to the power crisis ( ' dumsor ' ) , which rocked the nation between 2011 and 2015 .  according to him , the power crisis led to the loss of many jobs and even caused the death of some ghanaians .  dr bawumia , who was speaking on accra-based joy fm on tuesday , disagreed with president john mahama 's assertion that his administration engineered the fastest mobilisation of emergency power of 820 megawatts in the country 's recent history .  the npp bigwig said the president did not deserve praise for the prevailing stable electricity because it was his government which inflicted ' dumsor ' on ghanaians in the first place through what he termed bad economic and financial management of the economy .  dr bawumia said the current stability in power supply was due to temporary solutions the government put in place at high cost .
