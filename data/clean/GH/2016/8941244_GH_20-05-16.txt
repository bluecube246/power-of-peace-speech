ivorian refugees want gbagbo released before they return home  some ivorian refugees in ghana have demanded the release of their former president , laurent gbagbo , who is standing trial at the international criminal court on charges of crimes against humanity .  the charges pertain to the post-election violence the country experienced when he refused to leave office despite claims that he lost the november 2010 election in a run-off .  there have been calls for the refugees from cote d'ivoire , who have settled at the fetentaa refugee camp at berekum in the brong ahafo region to return home .  but the refugees say they will only do so when their former president is released .  the refugees have even rejected pleas from the ivorian foreign affairs minister who was there to convince them to return to their home country since peace had returned .  in an interview with citi news , a leader of the refugees , who gave his name as alex herve , said peace could only return to cote d'ivoire if their current president , alassane laurent gbagbo , who is on trial in the hague .  " they should bring back lauren gbabgbo from holland , they should free him because the authorities sent him there and secondly the put in jail many innocent ivoirians because they are bagbo followers , " mr. herve said .
