<p> President John Dramani Mahama has provided $6 million ( GH ? 23m ) to cater for the expenses of his Presidential Special Task Force set up to " pursue the release of the outstanding balance of $2 billion " from the controversial $3 billion Chinese loan . <p> According to a Cabinet Memo in possession of the Daily Statesman , the $6million covers three main cost components , with the areas of expenditure listed to include " Catered breakfast for Ghana team and visiting guests at negotiating venue ; catered snacks for day-long meeting breaks ; catered lunch for Ghana team and visiting guests as ( sic ) negotiating venue ; courtesy dinner for visiting CDB team upon closure of negotiation meetings . " <p> Chinese fried rice is the most popular food served for lunch and dinner in a typical Chinese restaurant , while among the popular snacks is prawn crackers . <p> Other important areas of expenditure for the Task Force 's travel to Beijing include " Hotel costs in Beijing for team members , as well as per diem for subsistence ( DSA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDB scheduled events or trips , comparable projects familiarization visits , etc. , that tends to be mandatory in the course of negotiation visits . " <p> The mandate of the taskforce is principally to see to the release of the $2 billion . They are to first of all see to the release of the $500 million for the three projects already agreed and also for the release of the remaining $1.5 billion , which , according to a May 2016 ' Decisions Memorandum ' , " The President would determine the utilization of the $1.5 billion that will remain after the commitments above are made . " <p> It was in March 2016 that the President agreed to pay the amount of $6 million . He instructed that the Ghana Infrastructure Fund should be responsible for " the funding of the work of the Task Force established by the President to pursue the $3 billion loan , and as a consequence of GIIF taking over GoG obligations , for GIIF to allocate an amount equivalent of $6 million to fund the work of the Task Force . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese will agree to reactivate the Chinese Development Bank facility . <p> In October 2015 , the President set up the Task Force " to re-engage CDB with the aim of utilizing the remainder of the US$3 billion CDB loan . " <p> The $3 billion commercial loan was hastily signed , against the advice of the Parliamentary Minority , under a master Facility Agreement between the Government of Ghana and the CDB on December 16 , 2011 , following parliamentary approval in July 2011 . <p> Since then , $1 billion has been released . $850 million was used for the Ghana Gas project in a deal that was awarded to Sinopec , a Chinese firm , without a competitive tender . <p> In addition , a whopping $150 million was also awarded to the Chinese to install " IT Enhanced Surveillance Project to provide aerial security for the oil and gas enclave in the Western Region . " Experts say the entire ICT infrastructure could have been done with $50 million , if it was not sole-sourced . <p> The agreement meant Ghana allowing the Chinese to lift 13,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jubilee Fields everyday . Even then , the Chinese saw that as insufficient . <p> The hastily signed facility , as was warned by the opposition New Patriotic Party , suffered persistent disagreement between GoG and CDB , with the Chinese refusing to release any more funds . <p> Finally in 2015 , the Mahama Cabinet approved a recommendation to reduce the facility to $1.5 billion to cover the two projects already under development and three , pending subsidiary agreements . <p> The three were : ( 1 ) spending $200 million to build just 12 fishing landing sites , ( 2 ) using $100 million in a dangerously discretionary manner as loans for SME Projects Incubation and ( 3 ) spending another $200 million on a scheme described as ' Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project . ' <p> However , CDB did not agree to the Cabinet decision and refused to disburse any funds beyond the $1 billion . <p> " When Cabinet 's decision was transmitted to CDB , CDB in turn decided to reduce the facility to US$1.0Billion to cover the two projects that were under development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDB 's opinion , the 13,000 barrels per day of crude oil that GoG had committed to the repayment of the Facility was not even sufficient to support the repayment of the committed US$1.0Billion , " a Cabinet Memo signed by Finance Minister Seth Terkper discloses . <p> Several other offers from the Ghana Government in 2014 went unheeded , until last year when Government saw a glimmer of hope , leading to the set up of the special Task Force . <p> The Mr Terkper confirms this in his memo to Cabinet : " At a meeting in Beijing in July 2014 , GoG offered other resources such as LPG for CDB consideration ; however , this was turned down by CDB . In April 2015 , however , CDB by letter dated 30 April 2015 , informed GoG that they would consider the suitability of LPG only after their own due diligence to determine its suitability as security for repayment of the Facility . <p> Further communication between GoG and CDB stalled at that point , until the appointment of the new Presidential Special Task Force , which revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Peacefmonline.com .
