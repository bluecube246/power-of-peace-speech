<p> " Jose did n't change . He did n't change the way he prepared the game , " the 32-year-old told the Daily Mail . " He did n't change the way he treated us . He did n't change anything . He was the same . <p> " Football is about players . The managers are not on the pitch . It is 11 against 11 . You have to be better than your opponent and , at the beginning of the season , we were n't . <p> " The players were more responsible for that situation than the manager . Of course it is difficult in football to change 25 players halfway through the season . <p> " But I think at this club if Abramovich could have , he would have changed all of us as well . It 's difficult to say it was only one guy 's responsibility . " <p> Ivanovic claims the players were all mentally prepared for the beginning of the new campaign , with Mourinho emphasising to the players how difficult it would be to retain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going wrong around us , " he said . " No-one inside the club knew . We finished brilliantly last season . We won the trophy . We knew how difficult it was . <p> " Jose told us the hardest season in football is the year after you win because everyone else has extra motivation . We were ready for that , but we did n't start well and we lost control of our game , of our minds . <p> " For me that period of three or four months was one of the most disappointing moments in my career . Player by player , we could not deal with the pressure of what being champions of England means . <p> " Your opponents have big motivation and they look at you differently , they start to be scared of you . <p> " But when we did n't win for six or seven games , people realised we were not as strong as last season . They could use that . And then they were n't scared of us . This was our problem as players .
