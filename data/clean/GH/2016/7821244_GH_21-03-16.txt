The Executive Director of Cocoa Health Extension Division of the Ghana COCOBOD , Dr Francis Baah , has urged cocoa farmers to plant high yielding cocoa varieties , instead of relying on aged trees with fertilizer .  Speaking at the inauguration of the ten-member Cocoa Task Force for the Nkwakwa district , Dr Baah said 60,000 cocoa seedlings will be distributed this year to cocoa farmers .  Government has step up measures to boost cocoa production through the distribution of free seedlings to cocoa farmers .  However , cocoa farms in mining areas are being destroyed by illegal miners .  According to the Chair of the Supreme Consultative Council ( SCC ) of Ghana Cocoa Board ( COCOBOD ) , Alhaji Idriss Alhassan , the cocoa sector could face a major setback if the environmental impacts caused by illegal miners is not addressed .  He said large cocoa farms are being destroyed in search for gold , calling on government to stop granting licence to small scale miners operating in cocoa growing areas .  Ghana is struggling to meet its targeted beans from neighbouring Ivory Coast in the 2014/2015 crop season , according to the finance minister , Seth Terkper .  Ecobank predicted cocoa production in Ghana to fall to between 730,000 and 750,000 tonnes following an outbreak of fungal black pod disease last year .
