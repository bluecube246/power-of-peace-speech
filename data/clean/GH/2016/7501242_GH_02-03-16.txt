"  " we wish to indicate that we share in the grief and trauma the late member of parliament 's family , constituents and indeed the nation are going through . therefore it would be insensitive and unsympathetic on the part of the ndc leadership and followers to actively participate in such by-election . "  he said , " the ndc does not want to be beneficiaries of a criminal act and , our supporters , because the abuakwa north happens to be one of the constituencies which ndc considers winnable.  #pulseelections2016  author  emmanuel tornyi reporter - pulse . category editor for politics and campus . i 'm a motivated and enthusiastic journalist who provides support to managers . i love writing because the pen is mightier than the sword .
