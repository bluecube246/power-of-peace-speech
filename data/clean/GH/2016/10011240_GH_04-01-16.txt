In an interview with Pulse Business , the law lecturer at the University of Ghana said the granting of 1% tax holidays to businesses and 15% on services could be counterproductive .  Under tax holidays , companies are given time limits typically between 5 to 15 years from the start of their operations in Ghana where they are exempted from paying taxes . It gives special dispensation to companies to recover investment costs before coming into tax payment position .  Addressing the issue , Abdallah challenged the rationale for the new law . " Was it that government thinks the tax holiday was too much ? , " he asked hypothetically .  On the 15% tax rates on services , he described the increase " as way too high . " According to him , increasing it from 5% to 15% can be counterproductive . He wondered if government actually considered the net margins of people before the imposition .  Government is already backtracking on 1% imposition of tax on local investors . In a statement today , the Finance Ministry said , tax on interest earned by individuals , Government has already submitted proposals to Parliament to reverse the position . "  A new tax on petroleum products has resulted in a 28% upward adjustment of petrol prices . Commercial drivers are meeting to announce hikes in transport fares .  Mr. Abdallah however hailed the 75% of corporate tax rate on businesses operating outside Accra and Tema . He said the move will motivate companies to move outside the two cities to take advantage of this tax law .  He said the new tax regime achieves the idea of consolidating all taxes , and bringing out clarity .
