in an interview with pulse business , the law lecturer at the university of ghana said the granting of 1% tax holidays to businesses and 15% on services could be counterproductive .  under tax holidays , companies are given time limits typically between 5 to 15 years from the start of their operations in ghana where they are exempted from paying taxes . it gives special dispensation to companies to recover investment costs before coming into tax payment position .  addressing the issue , abdallah challenged the rationale for the new law . " was it that government thinks the tax holiday was too much ? , " he asked hypothetically .  on the 15% tax rates on services , he described the increase " as way too high . " according to him , increasing it from 5% to 15% can be counterproductive . he wondered if government actually considered the net margins of people before the imposition .  government is already backtracking on 1% imposition of tax on local investors . in a statement today , the finance ministry said , tax on interest earned by individuals , government has already submitted proposals to parliament to reverse the position . "  a new tax on petroleum products has resulted in a 28% upward adjustment of petrol prices . commercial drivers are meeting to announce hikes in transport fares .  mr. abdallah however hailed the 75% of corporate tax rate on businesses operating outside accra and tema . he said the move will motivate companies to move outside the two cities to take advantage of this tax law .  he said the new tax regime achieves the idea of consolidating all taxes , and bringing out clarity .
