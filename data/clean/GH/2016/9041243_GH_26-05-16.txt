<h> Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture Dr Ahmed Yakubu Alhassan has blamed external factors for cassava shortage in the country . <p> A shortage of cassava has been reported across the country prompting a sharp rise in the price . <p> A bag of 250 kilogram of cassava which used to sell for GHC 200 now sells at GHC 600 and beyond in Accra . Same kilos which used to sell for GHC20 in parts of the Brong Ahafo region now sells at GHC 100 . <p> According to Alhassan , the problem is wider than the ministry 's mandate . <p> " There are transport issues , there are infrastructure issues , " he said in an interview with Citi FM . " So you know that it is a distribution problem which is wider than the mandate of the ministry . " <p> " There are remoteness of production areas in relation to markets ... " These are all things that are outside the mandate of the ministry , he said . <p> " I do n't build roads , " he noted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <p> " This country as at last year produced17 million metric tonnes of cassava and we need just 10 million tonnes to feed the population , " the minister added . <p> Cassava traders have rubbished claims by consumers that they have taken undue advantage of the situation to further increase cassava prices on the market . <p> Some cassava sellers who spoke to Pulse.com.gh indicated that it has become a waste of time and resources moving from village to village and town to town in search of cassava to sell since the commodity is so scarce . <p> The situation has compelled traders in the Brong ahafo and surrounding villages such as Ampoma , Amoma , Anyima and Suamere know for the best quality of cassava to inflate the prices of the little cassava that are available for sale . <p> " I use to buy a bag of cassava from Ampoma for as low as GHc 20 but it is now expensive and I now buy the same bag at GHc 100 so I have to inflate it in order to make profit , " Maame 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get just one bag of cassava , you have to reach Agbogbloshie market as early as 2am . You should have the strength to climb the truck that brings the cassava and also to struggle with others over the tubers , because the traders are more than the bags of cassavas that are brought to the market , " another cassava seller at Lapaz market in Accra recounted . <p> This scarcity has been largely blamed on the weather pattern . The rains have not been favorable affecting the tuber which used to be the cheapest product on the market . Transport hikes in transportation fares is also another factor . <p> " I also consider the cost of transport fares when pricing , " another cassava seller at the Madina market said . <p> The sad thing is the little cassava one is able to buy is not wholesome after cooking in many instances . <p> At this point fufu lovers will have to keep their fingers crossed and hope the weather is favorable the next cassava season .
