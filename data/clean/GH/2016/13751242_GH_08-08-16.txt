Girls in Volta region declare war on early marriage  More than 200 girls from four districts in the Volta Region have stated their resolve to resist attempts by their parents to force them into early marriage .  The girls said , " it is no for early marriage , we have rights to sexual health and our parents must support us or face the law " .  They made the pledge after a two-day regional camp on teenage pregnancy , sexual reproductive health and child marriage in Ho under the auspices of the Department of Gender with support from the Regional Coordinating Council and UNFPA .  The girls selected from junior and senior high Schools in Ho , Ho-West , Adaklu and Agotime-Ziope said they are not comfortable with increasing cases of early marriage and teenage pregnancy in the region and promised to lead exemplary lives and educate other girls on the subjects .  They said they assumed the roles of watchdogs in their communities and would report attempts to force any girl into early marriage to the Commission on Human Rights and Victim Supports Unit ( DOVVSU ) of the Ghana Police Service .  Ms Comfort Ablometi , Regional Director , Department of Gender , asked the girls to take good care of themselves and choose their life partners when ready for marriage .  She urged them to be resolute and avoid pre-marital sex , abortion , teenage pregnancy and early marriage to keep their hope of brighter future alive . Mrs Millicent Aidoo-Buameh , Agotime-Ziope Girl- Child Officer said the camp had built the confidence of the girls and given them the necessary exposure to take the campaign to their homes and communities .  Unconfirmed reports indicate that the region is leading in teenage pregnancy cases in the country with increasing number of child marriages .
