<h> 10 exclusive ways to make your partner love you more . <p> Love , they say is endless . So says the Holy bible too but have ever wondered that this same love could fade ? To think that love can kill is also another debate . That is why we need basic tips to spice up our love relationships . <p> The following are 10 tips to make your partner love you more . <p> 1. *change communication pattern* : Some partners always quarrel about little issues that should not generate in such , but it does because of the way issues are confronted . For instance , asking to go out with a partner may not be said properly and a fuss is made out of it . <p> A good communication pattern will go like " darling , can we go out today , I feel like outing " ? Whiles a bad one will go like " take me out today , I feel like outing " . <p> In the same way , sexual communication is also important . The approach used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm than good . For instance , waking one you rudely to demand sex will rather kill a person 's libido . On the other hand , a notice could be given earlier to prepare one 's mind and just before the act , a signal could follow . <p> Again , preparing the bed with clean sheet and straightening nicely is also a good way to communicate sex to your partner . <p> 2. *Smell fresh always* : Strong scent from the mouth , from the armpit , from the genital areas could affect the love of a partner . <p> These put people off and would n't want to be close to their partners . The old paste could be changed , the roll-on could also be change for a good scented ones . <p> If in any case a partner thinks , " oh , If you love me , you should learn to appreciate however I am , if u do n't then it means u do n't love me " , your partner will leave you . Some behavioral patterns also have to change . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , try twice a day . <p> *3 . Learn to say sorry when necessary* : saying sorry heals wounds . Sorry can make an extremely furious person calm down . If you do n't believe me , try it now and see the difference that make . It wo n't cost a thing to say , " Baby , am sorry , it was n't intentional " or " I did n't mean to offend you , am sorry " when one does something wrong . <p> If you do n't say sorry and someone says it outside , your partner wo n't come back . I remember offending my partner but did n't want to say sorry because I believed it was not my fault . It generated into a heated argument which nearly broke our relationship . A simple sorry revived the relationship . <p> *4 . Be fashionable : * A change in ones wardrobe matters . If your old clothes are still what you wear , it might push your partner aside . Whatever happened to fashion ? <p> There are a lot of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fashion , on the other hand , does not mean dressing ' wild ' or being ' nude ' but following the right trend of fashion that you think your partner loves . <p> When one fails to appear nice before a partner , he/she will find someone else attractive and that is not healthy for a relationship . <p> *5 . Be humble* : Humility does not mean ' total submission ' . I say total submission to mean that you do n't have to succumb totally because one partner is the ' breadwinner ' or ' abusive ' . <p> Grant respect the best way you can and also Say ' please ' when you have to so that a lasting relationship could be built . <p> *6 . Be serviceable* : Being serviceable in all areas matter most in ever relationship . <p> Running errands for your partner is such a romantic feeling . It should n't be a bother at all . In the same way when it has to do with lovemaking , it is a service which should be offered to each other with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : As the saying goes , " bad friends corrupt good manners " . Too many friend means that there may be bad nuts among them . Be careful of the friends you make and bring home , they can cause you heartbreak . It is said that if a friend comes to pick your partner out and stay late in the night before coming home , then watch out for that friend . The same friends may also give you both good and bad advice . Choose the few good ones but wise up . <p> 8. *Give gifts* : Learn to shower gifts on your partner to make him/her feel that you care . <p> Little gifts are very important and it could be given not just on birthdays , christmas and anniversaries but any given time . Do this just to surprise your partner . I love surprises and I know you do too . Even if you do n't , those little gifts wo n't hurt . <p> *9 . Show gratitude* : Learn to appreciate and recognize the value or significance of something your partner does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest attitude one can acquire is that of gratitude . <p> If you do n't appreciate what someone does , you ca n't be grateful for it too . Showing gratitude relieves your partner from guessing whether you like a gift or not . <p> *10 . Use pet names* : Special names like darling , sweetheart , babe , honey , sugar , dear , etc. , help spice up relationships . They bring about fondness , build intimacy and help remind you of who your partner is to you . Even if one party is angry at the other , mentioning the name alone brings the feeling of " oh my gosh , he just called me babe " , or " oh my gosh , she called me honey " . <p> Your relationship will not be the same after going through this .
