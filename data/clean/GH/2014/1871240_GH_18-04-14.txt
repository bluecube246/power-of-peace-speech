ghana loses ? 2.43m to fire in january , february 2014  fire disasters that keep striking the country have caused damage to life and properties worth gh ? 2,427,911.00 .  this colossal amount , which is the total of various values placed on properties destroyed across the country , merely covers january and february 2014 .  according to statistics made available by the ghana national fire service ( gnsf ) , accra tops the list with a total damage valued at gh ? , 168,260 , followed by western region ( wr ) with gh ? 96,680 , then brong ahafo region ( bar ) gh ? 80,621 while that of volta region ( vr ) stands at gh ? 60,270 .  the northern region ( nr ) recorded gh ? 14,780 while tema ( tr ) had gh ? 7,300 . the cost of items which were salvaged was gh ? 7,070 .  currently , there has been 300 domestic fires , 71 bush fires , and 107 commercial fires all totalling 779 . the number of persons who got injured  it is expected that the figures for march and april would increase as the country keeps recording rampant fire outbreaks .  for the whole of 2013 , the cost of damage from disasters across all the 10 regions of the country was gh ? 25,081,919.05 .  meanwhile , there was a total of 5489 fire outbreaks across the nation last year which injured 1,128 persons and caused 213 deaths .  although the year has just hit the quarter mark , the country has been already whacked by fire disasters of various levels of intensity .  among them was the conflagration that devoured 200 shops in the secondhand clothes market in accra and rendered 2,000 traders jobless in march .  in addition , more than 500 traders lost their sources of livelihood when an inferno engulfed sections of the kumasi central market in february , while the timber market in accra was also gutted by fire early this april .  just last saturday , over 5,000 wooden stores and accommodation units at the konopka market at agblogbloshie in accra , got destroyed by fire . , have been rendered homeless .  apart from the properties , a mother and her four children were also killed by fire at kwabriem , a suburb of ejisu in the ashanti region .  unfortunately , although there has not been substantive prosecutions to prove that such disasters are arsons ( despite the assistance of a crack us fire investigative team last year to identify the cause of the fires ) , the major causes of the fire outbreaks have been generally and collectively identified as non-observance of basic fire safety regulations offered by the gnfs , a conclusion similar to what the us team observed .  very often these fire disasters start from seemingly innocuous sources that we may sometimes be tempted to underrate , such as inappropriate disposal of the stubs of smoked cigarettes , gas leakage , mishandling of electronic equipment and illegal electricity connections among others .  but not until we become wary of these things , it would indeed be an arduous task to nip fire outbreaks in the bud .  for example , last year , president john mahama disclosed makola market , experts traced its genesis to an illegal electrical connection .  while in the past , markets were hubs of activity only in the daytime , increasingly , they have become shanty towns characterised by hundreds of unauthorised residential structures of different shapes and sizes .  it is not unusual to find residents operating propane gas stoves and electrical equipment at night , which sometimes trigger fires that the fire service is helpless in extinguishing because of the complicated way of siting structures that impede speedy access to the fires .  outside of urban areas , bush fires are a common fire disasters in the country and have also been identified as the largest single cause of the ecological degradation and fast decreasing productive capacity of the environment .  apart from the effects of bush fires on crop production , their effects on livestock production are rather worrying .  bushfires became a significant part of public discourse in the early 1980s when they exacerbated drought conditions and worsened the famines that ghana experienced in those times , forcing the promulgation of laws to prevent pndc law 46 ) .  however , not even these legislative interventions were sufficient in preventing the behaviours that result in bushfires , despite provisions that punish the breach of these laws , hence the establishment of the national wildlife policy in 2005 to provide a more holistic methodology for preventing bushfires .  this includes more emphasis on public education on the causes and effects of bush fires .  in the end , public education might be the key to preventing the fires that have become a frightfully constant feature in ghana .
