Ghana Needs a National Research Foundation - Prof. Buah-Bassuah  Prof. Paul Kingsley Buah-Bassuah , Professor of Laser and Optical Physics of the University of Cape Coast , has advocated the institution of a National Research Foundation to support research .  He said the nation as a matter of priority should support and equip research laboratories to improve upon research and development and that research work should be the immediate technological transform , since most developed countries adopted these strategies to come out with new products .  Prof. Buah-Bassuah said this during his inaugural lecture in Cape Coast on the Topic " Tailoring Light to Discovery : The Potential Factor . "  He said for any meaningful research to go on , there was the need for funds in terms of scholarship for the training of upcoming scientists , equipment for research work as well as exchange programmes among universities .  The lecture , which was to showcase some achievements of Prof Buah-Bassuah with regards to capacity building through the establishment and acquisition of equipment for Laser and Fibre Optics Centre of the , Prof. Dabire Domwini Kuupole .  The lecture was interspersed with musical interludes , cultural display and video shows and was attended by traditional authorities , professors , deans and heads of departments and faculties , heads of senior high schools and the clergy .  The Lecture explored the modalities of discovery using any form of light to explain the fundamental concepts and technological implications derived from the investigations stretching from agriculture to industry .  It also explored the use of liquid drop dynamics to explain in terms of surface tension , how the drop after fragmentation breaks up into fractals before diffusion .  Light is said to scatter on both smooth and rough surfaces and in applying such phenomena of light scattering , the sun is used to monitor pollutants from industries and the laser is used to monitor soils nutrients .  Prof. Buah-Bassuah also stressed the need for the government and other stakeholders to ensure that basic incentives that are given to researchers in terms of monies to pay for their publications , books and register their patent should be maintained with the necessary .  " The Government should provide ways to maintain our intellectual property right from research to equip our laboratories with our own state funds to safeguard us from our frustrations , " he said .  Prof. Buah-Bassuah explained that research work gave new ideas for technological build-up and strengthened teachings , adding that most work done by researchers is owned by the university and could give additional income to the state .  He said there was the need to strategize to protect people 's intellectual property right from research , as well as their discovery , , noting that the state miss-out a lot of ideas since some of these discoveries can not be translated into technology now in Ghana .  " All our universities should have patent and publication officers to streamline both inflow and outflow of knowledge from research work , our knowledge from research can put us in different arena of progress " he added .  Prof. Buah-Bassuah said the way forward with research findings should aim at the immediate benefit to the society .  Prof. Kuupole commended Prof Buah- Bassuah for LAFOC ) at UCC which marketed the university in the international market .  Prof. Kuupole called for a collaborative effort from professors and lecturers to come out with works that would impact on societal development and take people out of poverty .  Prof. Buah-Bassuah who was born 62 years ago had his basic education at Twifu Wamaso in the Central Region and has gone through the academic ladder to be a professor of Laser and Optical Physics .  He has to his credit Lensmeter to measure the power of a lens , fluorometers and optical digital system for track analysis . He has also organized 15 international conferences and training courses in Cape Coast and attended 96 international conferences and has 75 publications .
