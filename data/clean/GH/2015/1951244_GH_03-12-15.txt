Prince Narkortu Teye  The four-time African champions finish the year on a low , but go four places better than they did a year ago  Ghana have dropped three places in the latest edition of Fifa World Ranking released on Thursday .  The December version sees Ghana tumble to 33rd on the monthly assessment behind the Republic of Ireland and the USA , having occupied the 30th position for the month of November .  The Black Stars also dropped from 793 accumulated points for the past month to 778 on the current standing .  This is the second successive slump on the path of the three-time World Cup participants following a similarly fall in November .  The Blacks Stars ' goalless draw and 2-0 win over 172nd-rated Comoros in the 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifying double-header in November could have accounted for the decline .  Ghana started the calendar year on the 37th position in January , the lowest over the 12-month period , and achieved their highest ranking in March rising to 24th on the ladder .  On Africa behind Cote d'Ivoire ( 19th in the world ) and Algeria ( 28th ) . Cape Verde ( 39th ) , Tunisia ( 40th ) , Senegal ( 44th ) , Congo ( 48th ) , Guinea ( 50th ) , Egypt ( 57th ) and Cameroon ( 59th ) comprise the top 10 .  Back on the global stage , Belgium maintain their hold at the summit of the table , while Argentina , Spain , Germany , Chile , Brazil , Portugal , Colombia , England and Austria complete the top ten in that order .  Ghana 's highest ever performance since the ranking 's introduction in August 1993 remains a 14th place in February 2008 , while its worst placement was an 89th position in June 2004 .  The Black Stars return to competitive action in March 2016 when they take on Mozambique -- currently ranked 111st - in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying double-header.
