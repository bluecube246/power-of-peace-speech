SC petition on appointment of EC Chair ; hearing adjourned  The Supreme Court has adjourned the hearing of a petition brought by a broadcast journalist , Richard Dela Sky ; over the appointment of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission ( EC ) .  The adjournment is to allow the Attorney General time to file a statement of case in reaction to the suit and also give ample time to both teams to file a joint memorandum of issues for adjudication .  The applicant , a journalist with Citi FM ; is invoking the jurisdiction of the highest court of the land , to interpret certain provisions of the 1992 Constitution in relation to the appointment of an Electoral Commissioner .  According to him , upon a true and proper interpretation of the constitution , it is the responsibility of the Council of State to choose who becomes the EC boss , a decision which shall be binding on the president .  There has been intense pressure on President Mahama to consult political stakeholders and other personalities before a replacement is named tenure expires sometime next week .  In view of the divergent views that have so far been expressed ahead of the much expected Presidential announcement of the next Chairman for the Commission , Mr. Sky filed the petition to help define a clear path that the President and all future Presidents must navigate in making appointments to the Electoral Commission .
