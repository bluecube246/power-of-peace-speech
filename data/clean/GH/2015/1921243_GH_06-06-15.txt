<p> During the latter part of the twentieth century , I got admitted into Prempeh College . My decision to attend Prempeh College that time was based on myriad of factors which included the quality of learning environment , discipline and for my dad , the location factor . I found the school-the learning environment and landscape to be academically uplifting . Ruben Tetteh Sackey ( aka Tusker or R.T ) , who a decade earlier had taken the tutelage of the school from M.K Atiemo as the headmaster , had the onerous task of a " system restore " of the school to meet the designs of the Founding Fathers . He worked hard as a headmaster to raise the profile of the school and it became like a city on a hill . Today , Prempeh College continues to produce more science and engineering students for universities than any school in the country . When I first entered the school in 1993 , Prempeh College was more than a military camp . Strict enforcement of rules and regulation was a daily staple . All school gatherings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion/assembly and those tutors who absented themselves were penalized . He was present at every official gathering of the school and he would seize the opportunity to talk to his " gentlemen " and garnish his admonitions with some maxims in Latin . One particular saying which is still green in my mind which I would not forget even on my deathbed is : " memento te mortalem esse " -meaning , " remember that you are mortal " . <p> During his time at Prempeh College , the schedule for morning assembly was designed in such a way that every Monday morning was " courtesy campaign " where ethics , etiquettes , and rules for good living were preached and taught . His two favourites hymns which never got missing during a major events were " How Sweet the Name of Jesus " and " Jesus Shall Reign Where'er the Sun " At Prempeh College during the time of R.T Sackey , cheating in end of term or year examinations was tantamount to dismissal . Such letters were common during his days . He was someone who would never bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving campus without an attracted suspension at the first instance and the second offence was dismissal . Prempeh College during R.T Sackey 's time was very nostalgic . My best moments growing up in life were at Prempeh College . It became a watershed for me . It was the place where I picked the best friends I have . He inspired us . R.T Sackey was phenomenal . The school won the first then Brilliant Science and Mathematics Quiz in 1994 . When the first batch of Senior Secondary School results became a national opprobrium , he provided a leadership which put Prempeh College results among the best in the following year . He told us that he did not only want to raise men who were great in minds , but also men who were strong . Every student during his time was required to come to school with a well sharpened cutlass and a hoe . That was to say that weeding of lawns also become part of the integrated training at Sofoline . He was a strong man . He had the courage to take decisions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of R. T Sackey lied in the fact that he was both tough-minded and tenderhearted . He was characterized by incisive thinking , realistic appraisal and decisive judgment . His strong austere qualities made for his firmness of purpose and he achieved a lot for the school . It was Martin Luther King Jr who once said in life there are some sad moments which can not be completely explained by those symbols called words . Their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart . Such is the moment we are experiencing-the death of R. T Sackey . Like Robert Kennedy , he braved the disapproval of his fellows and the censure of his colleagues . He had a moral courage to do what was right and he was convinced of the same . Death has punctuated the great sentence of the life and times of R.T Sackey . Again , Martin Luther King Jr reminds us that " death is not period that punctuates the sentence of life but a comma that punctuates it to a lofty significance . " Anytime I visit Prempeh College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , R.T Sackey lives with us in time , hearts and minds . The boys he groomed are an eternal reminder about the great feat he achieved for Ghana and beyond . Today as we celebrate the life of R.T Sackey , I would quote a requiem verse he liked to quote from the Greek New Testament : " I tell you this , brothers : flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God , nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable . " It is sad to lose a loved one . It is sad to stand before the bier of great man like R.T Sackey . To the family , I know that nothing that I say or write can bring comfort to you . Nothing that anyone else can say can bring comfort . But the words of a Galilean peasant : " peace I leave with you ; my peace I give you . I do not give to you as the world gives . Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid " . Certainly our hearts are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in the noon time of self-actualization and fulfillment but in the midnight of despair and sorrow . We are overcomers . The solemn words of Isaac Watts so wonderfully assures us : Our God , our help in ages past , Our hope for years to come , Our shelter from the stormy blast , And our eternal home . Under the shadow of Thy throne Thy saints have dwelt secure ; Sufficient is Thine arm alone , And our defense is sure . We shall meet on the streets of New Jerusalem and we shall say that " Oh death , where is your victory ?
