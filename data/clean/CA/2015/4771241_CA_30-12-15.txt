<h> High-flying invention marks B.C. student as top science mind of his age Add to ... <p> The Globe 's B.C. bureau is profiling 10 young people aged 20 and under who are doing great things in fields ranging from arts to science to activism . At 17 , inventor Raymond Wang is in talks with major aircraft manufacturers about his device that will improve air quality in aircraft cabins . <p> Grade 12 is always a busy , exciting time for students but Raymond Wang has had a little more on his schedule than most . <p> In addition to preparing for final exams , the St. George 's School student in Vancouver has been doing public speaking engagements , including giving a TED talk and making a presentation at the Society of Experimental Test Pilots annual symposium in the United States . <p> In addition , he 's been talking with Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS about how to get aviation regulatory approval for a device he developed for a high school science fair . <p> Last spring , the 17-year-old vaulted into the headlines when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair , which is like the Olympics for young science students . It is the world 's largest high school science fair , and to get top prize all Mr. Wang had to do was beat out 1,700 brilliant students who had been selected from 422 science fairs in more than 75 countries . <p> His idea was to make aircraft cabins healthier by improving air quality . <p> " Essentially , after doing various computational and visual simulations , I designed a patent-pending device that , for the cost of about $1,000 , reduces disease transmission in planes by about 55 times , " Mr. Wang said . <p> He did n't just come up with a smart idea , but he went into a lab and proved it would work . <p> " I generated the industry 's first high-fidelity simulations for aircraft cabin air flow , " Mr. Wang said . " A lot of people have studied the outside of airplanes extensively , and understandably so , because the airplane has to fly . But what I 've been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a solution to improve air quality , economically without the need to take the whole cabin apart or spend tens of thousands of man-hours or millions of dollars . " <p> Simply put , what Mr. Wang has done is figure out how , by modifying the air-circulation pattern , to isolate passengers in their own cushions of air , isolating them from the germs coughed and sneezed by fellow travellers . <p> Now all he has to do , between studying for exams and finding time to hang out with friends , is get regulatory approval for the device . <p> " You know those fasten seat belt signs you see on planes ? If you were to change the font for that or the wording just a bit , you 'd have to go through about two years of regulatory recertification , " Mr. Wang said . " So you can get an idea of how much red tape there is in this area . " <p> To help navigate through that complex world , Mr. Wang has been in talks with Airbus and Boeing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with these experts , " he said . <p> Mr. Wang said it was difficult at times balancing his work on the science fair project with his regular homework . <p> " During the research process it was a challenge sometimes . You know , I need to go home and get my school work done and often the simulations ran deep into the night , " he said . <p> But he managed to make it all work . <p> " The satisfaction I get coming up with a solution to a problem people all over the world have been having difficulty tackling , and to be able to bring something new to the table , whether it 's a new finding or new innovation , that 's kind of what keeps me going , " he said . <p> Mr. Wang is currently focused on graduating from Grade 12 and getting accepted to a good university . He 's applied to several in Canada and the United States . Harvard has offered him a spot , but he wants to weigh all the options before making a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or engineering , " he said . " With engineering you have that foundation to take an idea through implementation and with the business , you have that practical mindset . " <p> Mr. Wang said his ambition is to " not only have these cool ideas , but actually come up with things that deserve to exist and things that can make a real difference in these major issues -- like aircraft cabin air flow and like renewable energy .
