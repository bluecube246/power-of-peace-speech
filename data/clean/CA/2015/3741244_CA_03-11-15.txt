in opinion  viewpoints  ron srigley enjoyed annual teaching contracts at the university of prince edward island for several years . he is now suspended . his story is unusual , but it illustrates one reason university tenure still ...  new york , n.y . - by one measure , aziz ansari has taken just a baby step with " master of none . "  the new netflix comedy series , whose 10 episodes premiere friday , arrives as the latest in a tv genre of stand-ups ( think jerry seinfeld , louis c.k. , jim gaffigan ) depicting versions of themselves both on and off the stage .  but " master " is its own distinctive thing , thanks to the distinctive voice of ansari -- a top stand-up who can pack madison square garden in addition to being a capable actor building on his seven-season run as pint-sized impresario tom haverford on " parks and recreation . " he also created , produced and wrote " master " ( in cahoots with fellow " parks and rec " alum alan yang 32-year-old ansari has n't strayed too far for his new character , dev , a first-generation indian-american and aspiring actor who lives in new york , where he has found moderate success doing tv commercials and spends his ample free time with a varied troupe of friends .  " there 's no big premise , " says ansari . " i tried to make the series similar to stand-up in the way each episode deals with a particular topic : long-term relationships , elderly people , how indians are stereotyped on tv . i 've enjoyed all the acting work i 've done , but , until now , only in my stand-up have i felt like i 've been able to get out my voice . "  that voice is as bright as his sparkling eyes and luminous grin , and he imbues dev with an open-minded attitude and almost childlike wonder .  in the series ' first scene , he faces a potentially disastrous mishap : his condom breaks while in bed with rachel , whom he met hours earlier at a bar .  after dev spends the rest of the episode in an exploration of the pros and ( many ) cons of parenthood as he observes it among his friends .  was that scene inspired by a condom crisis of his own ?  " there 's been similar experiences in the bedroom that i 've drawn from , sure , " he concedes . " i do n't think this show is autobiographical , and this guy is a few years less evolved than i am , i 'd like to think . but there 's some overlap . "  but ansari says that , in ways small and large , he wants his show to feel authentic as well as funny .  before the bedroom scene was scripted , he recorded an improv conversation with noel wells , who plays rachel .  " i said , ' let 's pretend we just had sex and the condom broke , ' and i used that to help us craft the dialogue . "  along with putting out " master of none , " this year ansari joined forces " a research-based meditation on finding love . what he learned has definitely informed " master , " he says , " although i did n't want to do what might be called a dating show . "  " master " is n't . besides his amorous adventures with rachel , dev hangs with a crowd played by cast members including eric wareheim , lena waithe and kelvin yu . he also has an onscreen mother and dad , portrayed by fatima and shoukath ansari ( on hiatus from his regular job as a gastroenterologist ) , who happen to be the star 's real-life parents .  ansari was raised in tiny bennettsville , south carolina , where , despite his minority status , he recalls being targeted no more harshly than were the fat kid , the new kid and other outsiders .  " my skin colour and different background was just the thing kids made fun of when they made fun of me , " he explains . " but for the most part , it was ok . "  he enrolled as a marketing suggested itself in the stories he 'd spin for chums that kept them in stitches .  " they 'd say , ' you should do one of those new talent nights at the comedy clubs , " he recalls . " so i did one and i enjoyed it .  " but my voice as a comedian has continued to evolve into more complicated ideas : deeper stuff about race , my immigrant parents , police brutality . the real trick is n't just making it funny , but getting the audience to think , ' you 've found a deeper insight that strikes a chord with me . ' "  still , it does n't always have to be complicated .  " like , i was feeling frustrated how i do n't read enough books . all these great books , and i 'm wasting time looking at ludacris ' instagram page ! so i talk about that onstage and when people laugh , i realize i 'm not the only one .  " once you develop a voice , you can share things that , and everyone will respond .
