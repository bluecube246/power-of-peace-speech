<h> Off-label use of drugs common but risky : study <p> Once a drug is approved for a particular use , doctors may prescribe it for something else altogether , but a new study has found that sharply increases the risk for an adverse reaction . <p> Electronic records are now being used by , many doctors across Canada , and that allowed researchers from McGill University to look at 151,305 prescriptions written by doctors in Quebec province between 2005 and 2009 . <p> Off-label prescriptions caused more adverse reactions <p> They found that 11.8 per cent of the drugs were prescribed for something other than what they were designed for . These are so-called off-label prescriptions . Four-fifths of those involved the use of a drug for a condition where there was no scientific evidence to support it . In those cases , there was a 54 per cent greater chance the patient would have an adverse reaction and that sometimes included death . <p> For example , the drug quinine is used for malaria , but doctors sometimes prescribe it for restless leg syndrome . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences and even death . <p> ' Physicians ... need to be very cautious ' <p> " Physicians , I think , need to be very cautious in ... practicing off-label prescribing ... especially where there is a lack of evidence , " concludes Prof. Tewodros Eguale , who led the research team at McGill University . <p> " Patients need to be told about their drug treatments , " he adds . They need to know what treatments are available , and whether a particular drug is approved for their condition or whether there is any scientific evidence showing it is useful . <p> Regulatory agencies should monitor the off-label use of prescriptions , says Eguale . " Even if they do n't control the practice of medicine , Health Canada and other regulatory bodies , I think , have an obligation at least to monitor off-label prescribing because it is their obligation to monitor all drugs .
