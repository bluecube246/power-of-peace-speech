The historical perspective on the supply chain is " Field to Fork " , but Paul Uys , Senior Director , External , The Food Institute of the University of Guelph , challenged everyone to awaken to the new reality that " Fork to Field " is currently a dominant factor and that consumers are now driving demand for changes in the food supply system . <p> Uys shared his perspective with the audience at the Future of Food and Farming Conference at Country Heritage Park on October 6th .
