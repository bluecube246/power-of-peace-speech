Canadian named National Geographic ' Adventurer of the Year '  A mountain-climbing , globe-trotting , paragliding man from Calgary has been named " Adventurer of the Year " by National Geographic Magazine .  Will Gadd , 47 , snagged the magazine award for his ambitious 35-day , 650-kilometre paragliding flight over the Rocky Mountains from McBride , B.C. to the U.S. border .  " No motors , just flying along on a paraglider , going from thermal to thermal just like a hawk does , " Gadd told CTV Calgary on Wednesday . He and paragliding partner Gavin McClurg would land on the mountain and climb to higher vantage points before launching in between flights . All the while they held to one rule : all forward progress must be made by flying , not walking .  Gadd shares the Adventurer of the Year award with McClurg , an American whom he met for the first time shortly before their flight . Red Bull matched up the two intrepid adventurers for the daring stunt , and filmed it from a helicopter for their paraglider , kayaker , and champion ice climber who is fresh off scaling Mount Kilimanjaro in November . And at age 47 , the man Red Bull calls " The Captain of Adventure " shows no signs of slowing down .  " I just won the biggest ice-climbing competition in North America , " he said . " I keep thinking I 'm not going to do any more competitions -- I 'm getting a bit old for that -- but I keep winning , " he added .  Gadd says he 's had a " great year " and plans to continue his adventures for as long as he can .  " You get some magic sometimes in your life , and as I get older I appreciate those moments , " he said . " You never know when you 're going to get another one .
