( BMW Group )  Relaxnews Published Friday , September 18 , 2015 8:15AM EDT  Despite being incredibly busy outlining new technologies , innovations and models at this year 's Frankfurt motor show , BMW 's designers have still found time to put together the BMW M3 " M ? nchner Wirte , " a special model to mark the start of Munich 's world-famous beer festival , which gets underway on Saturday .  Inspired by BMW 's ties to both Munich and motorsport , the special car 's hand-painted external finish incorporates visual elements including Munich 's Olympic Stadium , BMW 's headquarters and the Wiesn-Sch ? nke beer tent at the Oktoberfest event itself .  The flowing blue-on-white mural is the work of Walter Maurer who , over three decades ago , was the creative mind behind the livery on the BMW M1 Procar racer that competed at a number of high-profile are very different , it was surprisingly straightforward to carry over the design from the two-door BMW M1 racer to the four-door BMW M3 Sedan , " said Maurer .  The " M ? nchner Wirte " is the second special ' M ' car that BMW has showcased this week . Over in Frankfurt where it has been detailing its plans for greener cars with undiluted driving dynamics , it caught motoring journalists off guard by also showing off the M6 Competition Edition .  The Standard M6 coupe is BMW 's performance flagship , and is capable of catapulting its owner and up to four passengers plus luggage from standstill to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds and on to an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h . And rather than simply being a muscle car , the M6 is just as capable on twisty , turning roads as it is on a drag strip .  However , the new Competition Edition , the elements of which can be retrofitted to an existing 2015-model year M6 , takes the 4.4-liter twin turbo engine 's power up to to 305km/h . To make even more of the extra power , a number of exterior components have been reworked in carbon fiber and there are a number of subtle aerodynamic tweaks , too .  Inside , the cabin is kitted out in fine-grain Merino leather while the gear lever trim panels and even the steering wheel spokes are formed from carbon fiber . A head up display is standard to ensure the driver can keep both eyes firmly on the road and the final touch is the choice of a Harman Kardon or a Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system .  The M6 Competition Edition option will be available to order as an M6 specification from late September and prices will start at $25,300 on top of the price of the standard car .  As for the BMW M3 " M ? nchner Wirte " it will be on show from September 19 until October 4 at the BMW Welt concession within Oktoberfest.
