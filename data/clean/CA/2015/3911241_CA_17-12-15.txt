connect with us  new horizons and union disagree about impact of scheduling change  laurel albina of the hosptital employees ' union addresses some concerned citizens and family members of the residents of new horizons care home on wednesday at an informal rally held at the facility . heu is concerned about upcoming cuts to care aid hours , while management says those hours are compensated by increased hours for lpns .  some staff of new horizons care home , their union and family members of those living in the facility are crying foul again after what they say is a proposal by the facility 's operator to cut staff hours beginning in the new year .  this week they took to the streets , town hall forums and city council chambers to express their displeasure .  meanwhile , new horizons management says the allegations being put forth by the union are inaccurate .  an informal gathering of concerned parties gathered along 16th avenue beside the facility on wednesday to discuss the matter .  two days before , lois jarvis , group devoted to ensuring adequate healthcare facilities in the region -- and barb biley , regional vice-president of the hospital employees ' union ( heu ) for vancouver island north , who represent the employees of new horizons , presented their views on the topic at the last meeting of the calendar year of campbell river city council .  jarvis and biley were asking council to write a letter to dr. brian carr , president and ceo of island health and health minister terry lake to request a review and investigation into the alleged cuts , " and the negative impacts they will have on our vulnerable seniors . "  " the profit model that is being used in seniors ' care facilities is proving to be a total failure , " jarvis told council . " individuals should not be profiting from residential care . we object to our tax dollars being used to provide inadequate care for our seniors and a lower standard of employment for their caregivers . "  while some people see it simply as a dispute present in many businesses -- employees arguing of public or political discussion , jarvis feels differently .  " this is not just a union/management issue , " she told council . " it is about care being provided to our seniors in their final years , " which she sees as a social responsibility .  and that care is threatened with the upcoming cuts to hours at the facility , according to the heu .  a letter recently sent out to residents of new horizons and their families , signed by sandra murphy , director of care at the facility , seems to disagree .  " there are no layoffs or reduction in direct care hours at new horizons care home as claimed by the heu , " reads the letter .  in the letter , murphy outlines the upcoming changes in scheduling , saying they actually improve the work environment for staff , improve care for residents , " and also meet the health authority 's care model for increased hours by registered nurses . "  murphy 's letter admits that under the new schedule there are fewer hours available for it is offset by the increased hours being assigned to licensed practical nurses ( lpns ) , " with the same budget being spent on providing an excellent standard of professional care to all new horizons residents . "  laurel albina , marketing representative with heu , said at wednesday 's meeting that they ca n't speak to the hours of lpns and registered nurses , but the cuts to rcas are " significant . "  heu claims that in the two years since care corp has taken over operations at new horizons , there has been a 63 per cent staff turnover rate , which is indicative of the conditions of their employment . staff turnover also negatively impacts residents ' quality of life , as they are unable to form bonds with their care workers when they lack continuity , biley says .  jarvis agrees .  " there 's a relationship that develops -- a loving relationship between the caregivers and the people they 're caring for -- and that 's continually being broken with the turnover . it 's not healthy for the residents that continuity will actually increase under the new scheduling , as the schedules are designed to have staff cover the same shift every day .  " our caregivers welcome this change , " the letter reads , " since they can better schedule their lives around a standard shift .  " our residents enjoy the consistency of seeing the same caregivers at the same time each day . "  rachel blaney , mp for north island -- powell river , also stopped by the meeting on wednesday at new horizons .  she 's in town while the house of commons is on break over the holidays , and said that although healthcare is a provincial responsibility , it 's her responsibility as the area 's federal representative to keep abreast of the concerns of her constituents .  " i just wanted to come down and hear from people about what is happening , " blaney said . " it sounds like there are some concerns here , and i 'm open to hearing more about those concerns . "  those concerns were possibly expressed most new horizons facility .  he and his wife come over from quadra frequently to visit his mother , and says he has seen first hand the deterioration of services over the years .  " i 'd rather be dead than be in there , " he said at the information meeting on the side of 16th avenue on wednesday .  " i 'm serious . from what i 've seen , the people that are working there , that are on the floors , they 're getting their butts run off , and they 're great , but there 's just not enough people . "  heu , more than anything else at this point , thinks there needs to be better communication around the subject of staffing requirements and expenditures .  " we had a meeting set up ( with management ) that was cancelled , and our follow up calls would n't be committed to , " albina said .  " i think that some transparency and open communication is exactly what 's needed from care corp and park place at this point forward .
