<p> The McGill University Health Centre has responded to criticism about its parking prices at the Glen site by lowering the rate of its express lot . <p> Those lots are above ground and only feet away from the main hospital entrances . The maximum rate has been $50 since the new hospital opened in the spring , but that is being lowered to $30 for cars parked there between 61 minutes and 24 hours . <p> MUHC spokesperson Ian Popple said the decision was made earlier this month after a meeting of the MUHC 's parking committee . He added that the express lots are designed for short-term use . <p> For the underground visitor parking , the maximum rate remains at $25 after 90 minutes . <h> Comments <p> We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts .
