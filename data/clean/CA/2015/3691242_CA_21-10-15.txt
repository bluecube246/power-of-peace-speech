the mcgill university health centre has responded to criticism about its parking prices at the glen site by lowering the rate of its express lot .  those lots are above ground and only feet away from the main hospital entrances . the maximum rate has been $50 since the new hospital opened in the spring , but that is being lowered to $30 for cars parked there between 61 minutes and 24 hours .  muhc spokesperson ian popple said the decision was made earlier this month after a meeting of the muhc 's parking committee . he added that the express lots are designed for short-term use .  for the underground visitor parking , the maximum rate remains at $25 after 90 minutes .  comments  we encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts . we are committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion , so we ask you to avoid personal attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful . if you encounter a comment that is abusive , click the comment box to report spam or abuse . we are using facebook commenting . visit our faq page for more information .
