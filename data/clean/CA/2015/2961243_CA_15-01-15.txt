For the past two years , Omar Borkan Al Gala , who now lives in Vancouver , has kept quiet on whether there was any truth to reports that he was deported from Saudi Arabia for being too handsome -- until now .  Al Gala sat down with Metro for an exclusive interview Thursday , revealing what he says really happened that day that led to him getting kicked out of the kingdom .  " I kept it as a secret , " he said with a mischievous glint in his eye . " But it 's not a really bad incident , to be honest . It benefited me more than it did me bad . "  Al Gala said he was traveling in Saudi Arabia with a group of friends in in Riyadh .  " We were just looking for something to do , " he said .  Having worked as a model since he was 18 , Al Gala said some girls at the festival recognized him and asked for his autograph and a photo .  But when the crowd of female admirers grew , he said authorities intervened .  " The scene was getting bigger , so the religion police did n't like it , " Al Gala said . " They came and they asked me politely to leave the festival ... because it 's not really allowed to mix with girls there . "  The next day , Al Gala said he left the country and returned to Vancouver .  " I was never deported , " he said . " I was asked to leave the festival , not the country . "
