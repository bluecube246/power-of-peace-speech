Plenty of cabinet material for Trudeau to choose from Nov. 4  GOODALE  CP  Ralph Goodale is likely a shoo-in for the new Liberal cabinet , as the only Liberal elected in Saskatchewan and a veteran of cabinets under three previous prime ministers , including Trudeau 's late father , Pierre .  OTTAWA -- Justin Trudeau will swear in a new Liberal cabinet on Nov. 4 and he 's got an embarrassment of riches to choose from among his 183 newly elected MPs .  Cabinet making is one of the most difficult tasks facing any prime minister , who must strive to attain geographic , linguistic , ethnic and gender balance .  At the same time , he must find a way to placate the raft of disappointed MPs who find their ambitions thwarted so that they do n't become problems down the road .  Trudeau has complicated his task by committing to a relatively small cabinet that boasts an equal number of men and women .  Ralph Goodale is likely a shoo-in , as the only Liberal elected in ministers , including Trudeau 's late father , Pierre . After that , the choices get more difficult .  Goodale is likely to be joined by a number of other experienced MPs , some of whom have served in previous federal or provincial cabinets . Among the veterans who might be tapped for a cabinet post are John McCallum , Judy Foote , Joyce Murray , Stephane Dion , Judy Sgro , Scott Brison , Dominic LeBlanc , Wayne Easter and Lawrence MacAulay .  But Trudeau will also undoubtedly want to include a lot of fresh faces , especially the " stars " he went to considerable trouble to recruit . Possible picks among the newcomers include :  * Jody Wilson-Raybould , former B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations .  * Harjit Singh Sajjan , a former Vancouver police detective and a highly decorated lieutenant-colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces who served three tours in Afghanistan and became the first Sikh to command a Canadian military regiment .  * Kent Hehr , a former Alberta MLA .  * Darshan Kang , another Manitoba MLA and head of the Manitoba business council .  * MaryAnn Mihychuk , former Manitoba cabinet minister .  * Robert-Falcon Ouellette , one-time Winnipeg mayoral candidate , former director of aboriginal programs at University of Manitoba .  * Bill Morneau , head of Morneau Shepell , the country 's largest human resources consulting company , member of Trudeau 's economic advisory group .  * Chrystia Freeland , former business journalist and author who won a Toronto byelection two years ago , member of Trudeau 's economic advisory team .  * Adam Vaughan , former Toronto city councillor who won a byelection last year .  * Arif Virani , lawyer who helped prosecute genocide at the United Nations ' International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda .  * Greg Fergus , former Liberal national director .  * Steven MacKinnon , another former Liberal national director .  * Anthony Housefather , lawyer and former mayor of C ? te-Saint-Luc , near Montreal .  * Marc Miller , lawyer and close friend of Trudeau 's .  * Melanie Joly , lawyer , runner-up in former MP , defeated in 2011 , former president of the Liberal party 's Quebec wing .  * Pablo Rodriguez , former MP defeated in 2011 .  * Andy Fillmore , Halifax urban planner .  * Bill Casey , former Conservative MP who quit over what he perceived as Harper government 's betrayal of Atlantic Canada , won re-election as an independent before briefly retiring , now back as a Liberal .
