The Etobicoke native discovered her gift at an early age through creative writing and the ability to connect with people . With encouragement from her family , MacKenzie eventually enrolled at Carleton University for journalism , while also pursuing acting on the side .  After graduation , MacKenzie combined both passions by landing a big break as the host of the Roger Cable show , Toronto Living . She 's gone on to work as a videographer for ATV/CTV News in Cape Breton and as a reporter for Barrie 's The New VR . Now , MacKenzie can be heard and seen anchoring Global Toronto 's 11 o'clock news program .  " I like people finishing their day with me , " MacKenzie said while sitting on the couch in her rustic Etobicoke home . " It 's when everyone 's armour has been taken off and their guard is down . They are either crawling in bed or sitting on the couch . They are winding down and if they choose to turn my show on , it 's a huge compliment . They which means so much . All the chaos of the day is on the side table and they are listening to the news and taking it all in . "  MacKenzie admits breaking into the competitive world of news was a long , gradual and grueling climb . It required perseverance , sacrifice and paying the proper dues by starting at the bottom .  " It took me some months to realize I had to leave home and go far away to start , " MacKenzie explained . " That 's when I moved to the East Coast and for a year I was a videographer . Every other day I was at the mouth of a coal pit covering a story like striking miners . It was at a time when the federal government was getting out of the two main industries in Sydney , NS , which were the coal industry and the steel manufacturing industry . That 's where I spent most of my time in Cape Breton .  " When interns comes in now , I always say if you 're going to get the bat , more power to you , but you 'll miss out on what being in the trenches is all about and what it teaches you and the character building it provides , " MacKenzie continued . " I will never take anything for granted ever again because of those early years . "  MacKenzie obviously loves her job . She won the coveted Edward R. Murrow Award for " Best Investigative Journalism " for a two-part story covering transit inaccessibility . However , there 's more to her than just the daily grind . MacKenzie and her husband Chris are the parents of Kate , six-and-a-half , and Matt , three-and-a-half . As any working mother will tell you , juggling children , a career , a husband and having a life can be a challenge .  " I did n't know how I was going to adjust to working the night shift and being a mom , because you ca n't tell the kids to sleep in , " MacKenzie said . " Even this year , I 've had to adjust again because my daughter of her Monday to Friday , so I want to be up in the morning when she wakes up . I feed her breakfast and walk her to school . Heading into September , I was like , ' Oh my gosh , how am I going to go to bed at 1 a.m. and get up at 7 ? ' Well , I 'm doing it . You adjust . You do it . There are days when you are a little more irritable than others , but you get by . You manage . I look at this family and what we do .  " We assess quarterly , " she continued . " ' How did we do these last three months ? What 's working ? What 's not ? Let 's make adjustments . ' It 's tough . It can be challenging . I have an awesome husband . He 's a Toronto firefighter . He works 24-hour shifts , but that gives him a lot of time at home . He covers for me when I 'm not here . My mom is great babysitters that fill in when we are both working . With all that , we get by . "  MacKenzie grew up in Etobicoke , and re-planting roots there has made life easier for her and the family . Many of her friends have come back to do the same . Whether it 's exploring the local trails with her kids , taking them for brunch at Bloor Street 's Cr ? me de la Cr ? me Caf ? , indulging in Maltese pastries at Joe 's Pastizzi or revisiting old haunts , MacKenzie revels in Etobicoke 's sense of community and the fond memories it 's provided .  " I have such an attachment to Etobicoke , " said MacKenzie , who originally moved there when she was nine years old . " All the different communities within Etobicoke have their own flair , their own personality . I 've lived here on and off over 30 years and it 's neat to see how a neighborhood has evolved . Islington Village is where I grew up . I 'm in it . I find there Inn is on Dundas , east of Islington , " MacKenzie added . " As a kid , I would spend my allowance at the Inn . My daughter now loves the Inn . It 's amazing how some things inherently happen . Like I said , especially with Islington Village , there 's a real sense of heritage . The murals are beautiful . That brings the history to the forefront . "  The Mackenzie household tells its own vivid tale , too . The open concept layout is welcoming and inviting . The rooms all flow with their d ? cor . Original hardwood floor bestows character on the house . A long harvest-style table with chairs and a bench fills the dining room . One feature MacKenzie points out is the mantel piece around the fireplace . She redesigned the classic high mantel with contemporary shaker squares . Surveying the place , this is a home that oozes functionality , practicality and even better , family .  " We bought this home for the main floor , " MacKenzie offered . " I said , ' together . Even when I 'm alone , I feel very at peace and very calm . I love that the main floor has no walls . I can see my husband cooking in the kitchen . I can see the kids colouring at the table . I get to see everything going on . I can break up fights or we can laugh with each other . A couple of weeks ago , my husband and son were playing mini-hockey over there . My daughter was painting a pumpkin left over from Halloween . I was cooking . I was thinking , ' This is what this main floor is supposed to do . '  " I also love photographs , " MacKenzie concluded . " Downstairs there 's a gallery wall in the basement . All I have up is photographs that we 've taken . Whether it 's for company coming over and they see our lives plastered on the walls or when I 'm home , I like looking around . I like seeing our story . "
