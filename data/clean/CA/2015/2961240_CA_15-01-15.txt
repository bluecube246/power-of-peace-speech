<h> Special testing is recommended to assess the safety of the pipeline in parts of northwestern Ontario , according to a preliminary report . <p> The Ontario Energy Board 's technical advisers need more information about the impact that TransCanada 's Energy East pipeline will have on drinking water sources , and special testing is recommended to assess the safety of the pipeline in parts of northwestern Ontario , according to a preliminary report . <p> The report , published online Wednesday , also says the economic benefits of the pipeline to the province are exaggerated and local benefits are expected to be small . <p> " The critical question is the incompleteness of the application , " said John McGrath a consultant with the OEB on the Energy East project . <p> TransCanada is expected to release more information and file additional documents with the National Energy Board , he added . <p> " But right now , the two technical reports on pipeline safety and environmental impact did not have enough information to assess if the application meets two of the six principles the ( Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pipeline safety . " <p> Tim Duboyce , a TransCanada spokesperson , said more documents will be filed in the next few weeks . " Additional information will be provided from engineering reports that we are in the midst of preparing . " <p> The Energy East pipeline is TransCanada 's $12-billion dream in which it wants to convert its 40-year-old natural gas pipeline from Saskatchewan to Ontario to carry diluted bitumen . It wants to connect it with a new pipeline it plans to construct through Quebec to export terminals and refineries in New Brunswick . <p> The Ontario portion consists of about 1,930 kilometres of gas pipeline that will be converted and another 104 kilometres of new construction . <p> OEB 's technical advisers say that four sections in northwestern Ontario -- about 99 kilometres in total length -- are currently double-wrapped with polyethylene tape and hence susceptible to stress corrosion cracking . These sections are near the communities of Ignace , Martin , Nipigon and Jellicoe . <p> These four sections would not meet TransCanada 's current coating specifications for a new pipeline , the OEB 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that one of these sections be tested to see if the rest also need to go through the same test before the pipeline can carry oil , said McGrath . <p> Called hydrostatic testing , it would involve sending pressurized water through the pipeline and looking for any weak spots . <p> Duboyce said TransCanada is carrying out integrity checks on the entire length of the existing pipeline . <p> Among other things , the OEB report says that Energy East will add " minimal increase in Ontario 's total emissions . " <p> The pipeline would likely increase emissions from " well-to-tank " in the rest of Canada but the impact is likely to be relatively modest , it said . <p> Keith Stewart , the climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace , pointed out that the report assumes that emissions will happen anyway , even if the project does n't get the go-ahead . <p> The report admits that greater oil transport through this pipeline will increase emissions related to pipeline operation , but that it may reduce the amount of oil transported by rail , thus reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rail could replace Energy East and I just do n't think that is possible , " said Stewart . <p> The National Energy Board 's figures indicate that about 182,000 barrels of oil was transported for export by rail in the last quarter of 2014 . Energy East , on the other hand , plans to move 1.1 million barrels of oil every day , he pointed out .
