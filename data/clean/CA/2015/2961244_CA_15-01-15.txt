Mirtle: The strange dysfunction of the San Jose Sharks

A quick glance at where the San Jose Sharks are in the standings does n't really offer a great picture of what 's going on with that team .  They 're sixth in the West , sure , with 51 points in 44 games , on pace for 95 points and the franchise 's 11th straight playoff berth .  Pretty decent , right ?  In the context of what the Sharks have been , not really . This is a team with seven 104-plus point seasons in those last 10 years , and in every one , they were considered a contender to varying degrees .  Never with any postseason success , beyond two years in the conference finals .  And that inability to win has created a little dysfunction there .  Here 's one story that has made the rounds . Back in November , fourth-liner Adam Burish was a healthy scratch a few games after not playing particularly well . He was told it was management 's decision , as they wanted to see young players like Barclay Goodrow In fact , it 's been an ongoing battle in San Jose with other players at various times . But in this case Burish wanted out . And GM Doug Wilson said he would oblige by finding a better situation for him .  The next day , Burish walked into the dressing room and his gear had been removed from the dressing room . Teammate Joe Pavelski , an old friend from their college days , told Burish he had been waived .  That 's not typical . Usually a coach or someone in management informs the player . But what happened was a disagreement between Wilson and coach Todd McLellan . The coach wanted to play Burish . The GM had other ideas and put him on waivers .  Reminds you a bit of Moneyball , actually , in terms of taking away a player a coach wanted to use .  That 's the basic outline of the story and just one small example of what 's going on in San Jose . In addition to what happened with Joe Thornton , Patrick Marleau and the year that Wilson and McLellan are n't getting along and that the coach may be fired at the end of the year .  That likely comes down to how they fare in the postseason , but it explains why you 're hearing McLellan 's name in the talks about who 'll coach next in Toronto .  Amidst all that , there 's still a good team in there somewhere . Heading into Thursday 's game against the Leafs , the Sharks are 13-6-1 in their last 20 games , despite so-so goaltending and despite not dominating teams the way they have in the past .  Some of that is they 're giving roster spots to the likes of John Scott and Mike Brown and do n't have the depth they 've enjoyed in the past . Some of it is they 're trying to work in younger players , as part of a rebuild that 's not really a rebuild that Wilson talked about in the off-season .  It 'll be fascinating to see if they get it together over the second half -- or if things @ @ @
