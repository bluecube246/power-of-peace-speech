wednesday marked the 20th anniversary of the canadiens hiring former players r ? jean houle as general manager and mario tremblay as head coach .  the hirings came four days after serge savard and jacques demers had been fired as gm and coach , respectively , only two years after the canadiens had won the stanley cup .  they have n't won another stanley cup since .  here 's the column by red fisher that appeared in the montreal gazette the day after houle and tremblay were hired :  new hab team has plenty to learn  published on oct. 22 , 1995  red fisher montreal gazette  the first time this week ronald corey had walked this walk to a waiting microphone , it was to bring the universe crashing down on several of hockey 's best-known names . general manager serge savard : gone . head coach jacques demers : bye-bye . andre boudrias ... carol vadnais , both gone as well , after the canadiens had limped into an 0-4-0 start to this season of hope .  yesterday hour of 4 p.m. , he was back behind the same microphone , wearing the same pained expression . blue suit . dark blue tie . white shirt . not a hair out of place . he was there not to bury anyone , but to praise his team of " new blood " that later on this night would produce a 4-3 , last-second victory over the toronto maple leafs .  sitting at a table to his right and looking properly solemn for the occasion were r ? jean houle , mario tremblay and yvan cournoyer -- all former bearers of the canadiens torch . the first two were master plumbers , cournoyer a former captain with 10 stanley cup teams , and a hall of famer .  " for those who know me , " corey crooned into the microphone , " i do things my way . "  so he does -- and what exactly has he done now that houle has been anointed as savard 's successor and tremblay has replaced demers ( " we needed a coach and a real one , " nation ) . what ?  i have known both of these men from the moment they joined the canadiens -- houle in 1969 and tremblay five years later . i have known cournoyer since 1963 , and he was among the best of the great canadiens stars who have pulled us out of our seats hundreds of times . all are good , decent men who have played with pain and stared down adversity , but this mountain they now approach is as difficult a climb as it gets .  they are brave men who are dedicated to winning , because that is what they were taught by great coaches such as toe blake and scotty bowman . as players , they knew how to win , but this is a new team without a shred of experience in the jobs mons. corey delivered to them . there are so many things they do n't know and , sadly , learning how to win all over again at this level takes a lot of time . there are no quick fixes . the 20 stanley cup rings they share a period , much less a game .  the rings did n't score the last-second goal against the leafs . pierre turgeon , who had been in an offensive coma during the first five games of the season , did .  hockey 's best and most successful general manager was sam pollock -- and he never earned a ring as a player . what made him successful was that he did n't allow his personal feelings to affect the way he handled his job . he was , for example , deeply disturbed when a number of his players , among them houle , defected to the world hockey association in 1972 and ' 73 , but when the opportunity arose several years later to get houle back , he did n't hesitate .  " exactly one minute ago , " pollock told me on the telephone one day in 1976 , " i signed r ? jean houle to a contract . "  " you what ? is that the same guy that had you screaming when he jumped to the quebec nordiques ? what made help our team , " pollock said . " is that a good enough reason ? "  what houle must do now , despite his inexperience , is get somebody to help his team . what he must do is to reach out for a quality goaltender to serve as a backup to patrick roy . ( corey was on the telephone a couple of days ago inquiring about edmonton 's curtis joseph ) . he says he needs time to assess what he 's got before making a move . good idea . a better one for houle is not to take too much time , because by then it could be too late .  he needs time to learn this business . he 's earned the right to it , but somewhere down the road he 's going to learn that it 's a jungle out there . picking another guy 's pocket is the most popular game in town .  " what does he do when the time comes to make a three-way deal with , let 's say , edmonton and boston ? " happens to be a former general manager and coach . " what does he do when he 's got a couple of sharks like ( glen ) sather and ( harry ) sinden on the telephone ? "  " reggie wo n't have to make a call , " neale responded . " the phones must be ringing already . "  the best player behind the canadiens ' bench last night was cournoyer , who scored 428 goals with 10 stanley cup teams and won the conn smythe trophy once . the feistiest , by far , was tremblay . since his retirement , he 's been employed in the normally non- violent area of radio and television , but he could throw it around during his dozen years as a player -- all of them dedicated to upholding the honour of the ch . there were times , it seems , when he was almost ready to die for it , and one night , he almost did .  he was ready to take on all comers , and that included dave schultz , who had built . schultz , however , was with the los angeles kings and in the twilight of his career as a player and fighter when tremblay decided to take him on .  bad mistake . several punches later , tremblay was flat on his back , with schultz sitting on his chest . the former flyer drew back his right hand for one more shot at tremblay , glanced down at the stunned canadiens forward -- and stopped in mid-punch . then he got to his feet and skated away . team-mates helped tremblay to the canadiens ' bench .  later , tremblay and i walked along a hallway leading to the team bus .  " were you trying to get yourself killed ? " i asked .  " i guess i did n't win that one , " he shrugged .  " schultz showed me a lot of class , " i said .  " he could have hurt me pretty bad if he had thrown that last one , " tremblay agreed .  at that moment , schultz , head down , was , mario , " i said . " here 's your chance to get even . "  tremblay looked up and broke into a broad grin . " hi , dave , " he said with a wave of his hand .  comments  we encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts . we are committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion , so we ask you to avoid personal attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful . if you encounter a comment that is abusive , click the " x " in the upper right corner of the comment box to report spam or abuse . we are using facebook commenting . visit our faq page for more information .
