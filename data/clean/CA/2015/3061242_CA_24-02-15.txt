<h> Port Union trail <p> Scarborough is undervalued real estate , but one thing it has in abundance is public land along Lake Ontario . <p> There are parks and lots of them -- some not displaying signs , but public land nonetheless -- both above the famous Scarborough Bluffs and below . <p> Facilities at these places are few . On many days of the year , residents walking their dogs are the most common visitors . But though no one 's exactly invited you there , you have the right to go . <p> And you should go . As a Toronto taxpayer you 've paid for these parks and trails , and you 're about to pay more . The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority has built a spectacular set of waterfront shoreworks along most of the Scarborough waterfront . Part of these shoreworks form an official waterfront park and trail , while the rest is unofficial , a waterfront trail you 're not supposed to use , though many do . <p> The official park is going to be extended -- probably -- with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , jog or cycle below the Bluffs all the way from the foot of Brimley Road to Pickering . <p> Does your neighbourhood offer something like that ? You can learn more about the Scarborough Waterfront Project on Tuesday , Feb. 24 , during an open house at Qssis Banquet Halls at Kingston and Markham roads , with a presentation and discussion by the TRCA at 7 p.m . <p> Here are seven public places along the Scarborough waterfront you should know about : <p> 1 . ROSETTA MCCLAIN GARDENS -- Raptors are counted here as they fly south each fall ( 11,128 were spotted by volunteers in 2014 ) . Rose gardens , a rock fountain and great views above the Bluffs are wedding-picture-worthy backdrops in this 23-acre space you might easily miss off Kingston Road at Glen Everest Road . <p> 2 . GATES GULLY -- Doris McCarthy , the landscape artist , lived overlooking this path , also called the Bellamy Ravine , along a trickling brook to the water . Visitors can leave their cars on Bellehaven Crescent south of Kingston and Bellamy Road South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once below , where a sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore , called Passage , stands , they can walk west along the shoreworks up to the western edge of Bluffers Park , or east , without much difficulty , to below the Guild Inn . None of this is an official park . The TRCA says it is n't safe , and so its waterfront project is needed . <p> 3 . GUILD INN -- The old Inn on Guildwood Parkway has been boarded up since 2001 . It 's interesting now , surrounded by fragments of vanished Toronto buildings and a Greek theatre . Soon , if the City of Toronto 's plans are realized , it will be a genuine all-weather attraction again , with the renovated Inn reopened as a restaurant and banquet hall , and the surrounding Guild Park fitted with ' cultural precinct ' improvements which will also bring artists to what former owners Rosa and Spencer Clark organized as an art colony . The latest TRCA waterfront project will also give visitors a safe path down to the water . <p> 4 . BLUFFERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a crime . That aside , Bluffers Park has more going for it than its public beach and marina . This large expanse reached down a steep hill at the foot of Brimley has pleasant paths and fishing spots . Upper portions of the park , including one at the south end of Chine Drive west of Brimley , are watched over by residents . <p> 5 . PORT UNION WATERFRONT PARK -- For decades , stones shoring up railway tracks were all Port Union had . At the south end of Port Union Road , however , the TRCA and city have opened a waterfront park that goes on for kilometres either east to the Rouge Park 's Rouge Marsh -- we assume you 've heard of the Rouge Park -- and into Pickering , or west to East Point Park , where hikers can turn up the Highland Creek trail . <p> 6 . WATERFRONT CYCLING TRAIL -- Also known as the other waterfront trail . Yes , you can cycle across Scarborough . Just be prepared to follow the map charting the route along a zig-zag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Kingston itself : ( **59;629;TOOLONG ) From just west of Highland Creek , though , the cycling route runs through the waterfront park trail into Pickering . <p> 7 . UNOFFICIAL NUDE BEACHES -- The locals do n't appreciate this , but certain spots on the Scarborough waterfront have long been thought of by some as " clothing optional . " The Federation of Canadian Naturists cites Warden Beach , found down a path to a pumping station between Warden Avenue and the eastern edge of the Toronto Hunt Club golf course . On its website , the group also recommends another beach location near the south end of Beechgrove Drive : " Keep walking west . Around the first point it is considered safe to remove your clothes , but almost everyone waits until they are well west of the point , " it says .
