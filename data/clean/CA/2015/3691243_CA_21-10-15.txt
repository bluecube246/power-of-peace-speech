<h> Topics <p> The Detroit Red Wings are not accustomed to losing to the Edmonton Oilers . <p> In fact , prior to Wednesday 's 3-1 defeat , the Red Wings had not lost to the Oilers in nine games , dating back to Feb. 4 , 2012 . <p> They had not lost in regulation to Edmonton since Dec. 3 , 2009 . <p> But this is a different Oilers team and Detroit is currently trying to find their way under new head coach Jeff Blashill . <p> " I think the ( Oilers ) have always been skilled and they 've always been fast , but now they believe in the system and they 're doing more things right , " said Red Wings centre Henrik Zetterberg . " This was better than our last game , I think we battled harder and won some more battles . We created a little more offence . Obviously , those two quick goals hurt us . They 're pretty deadly when they get the chances . <p> " We felt pretty good after the first period . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're playing with some better structure and you ca n't really give them any odd-man rushes . " <p> Two goals within 30 seconds in the second period proved the Red Wings ' undoing . <p> Connor McDavid undressed goaltender Petr Mrazek 6:34 into the second period and then defenceman Kyle Quincey kicked the puck into his own net to give the Oilers a 3-0 lead . <p> " On that second goal , I should have been more patient and maybe the game would have been a little different , " said Mrazek . " And the third goal right after , that was a bad bounce , but if the second goal did n't go in , it would have been a different game . " <p> The loss was the Red Wings ' third straight , having started the year on a three-game win streak . They 'll conclude a four-game road trip against the Calgary Flames on Friday and the Vancouver Canucks Saturday . <p> " We were n't great in the first , but we 're on the road , we 're in another team 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , " Blashill said . " I thought we did a lot of really good stuff in the second and we had two huge blowups and you ca n't win with big blowups . I thought they were n't necessarily systematic errors , they were just a couple of errors on our end , individually . But you ca n't give up breakaways , you ca n't give up two-on-ones , you ca n't give up three-on-twos like that .
