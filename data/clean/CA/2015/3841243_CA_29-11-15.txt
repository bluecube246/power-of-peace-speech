hectic race kicks off lobster season  halifax - before the crack of dawn monday , hubert saulnier and nearly 5,000 other lobster fishermen prepare for the most hectic and lucrative day of their season .  " dumping day " in southern nova scotia falls on the last monday in november , where 1,500 fishing boats depart at the same time , usually 6:00 a.m. , to let out their lobster traps for the year .  " it 's the worst day of the season , " said saulnier , captain of the lindy dawn and 46-year veteran of dumping day . " in the winter it 's cold and rough sometimes , but it 's not as bad as dumping day . "  the stakes are high for those involved as the fishing vessels race to lay claim to the best spots .  " everybody has their favourite place to fish for obvious reasons , " said hubert . " it 's a race , you want to get out there and you want to drop your traps and you want to you have another load . "  not being able to lay claim to the best spots can mean thousands in lost revenue , missing out on the day completely is almost out of the question .  " if you miss out on the first few days because your boat breaks down , ... you just have to bear with the situation and live with it , " said saulnier . " it 's not so good when you 're tied up in the wharf ... and you see people coming in with five-six thousand pounds of lobster . "  lobster fishing in the canadian atlantic ocean is divided into districts , each with its own separate fishing season . the southern part of nova scotia , districts 33 and 34 , open for lobster fishing on the last monday in november and the season remains open until may 31 .  districts 33 and 34 are widely considered the largest and most lucrative lobster regions in the country . district 34 alone accounts for roughly 23 per cent of all north american lobster .  " it 's important for the economy ... and to canada as a whole because it 's a very lucrative fishery , " said mark comley , area chief of southwest nova scotia with the department of fisheries and oceans .  the unpredictability of the weather and the intense competition for the best lobster fishing spots contributes to making dumping day a fairly dangerous endeavour .  " we 've lost a few boats ; we 've lost a few lives , " said saulnier .  times have changed and safety has become of the utmost concern . before anyone heads out , everyone must agree it 's safe . the past two dumping days have been delayed because of the weather .  safety on dumping day is also of high concern for the canadian coast guard , where two ships will be patrolling the area before the 6:00 a.m. start time . the coast guard will be also pre-positioning three life boats in the region and will have two military rescue aircraft on " enhanced standby . "  saulnier said the changes have come from more than just the to keep up has forced virtually everyone to improve their fleet .  in the past , if it was dark or if the wind blew more than 40 kilometres an hour , fishermen would pack it in for the day . now the operation runs around the clock and in much worse conditions .  " it 's changed from something to do , to a job , " said saulnier .  the exact value of the lobster will be determined by how many everyone brings in , but saulnier said he 's hoping for $5 per pound .  " the main thing is hopefully everyone comes home monday night with their traps in the water and everyone is safe and nobody gets hurt . "
