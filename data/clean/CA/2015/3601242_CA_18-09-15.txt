<p> Investors were responding to reports that SABMiller 's largest shareholder -- cigarette maker Altria which owns a 27 per cent stake in the world 's second-largest brewer -- is open to considering a takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev , the maker of Budweiser , Corona and Labatt 's , that could be worth around US$90 billion . <p> A successful takeover would immediately allow Molson Coors to increase its stake in MillerCoors to 50 per cent from 42 per cent , according to terms of its 2008 joint venture deal . <p> Industry analysts expect U.S. anti-trust regulators would also require the world 's top two brewers to sell SABMiller 's stake in MillerCoors . Molson Coors has the right to a first and last offer to purchase the remaining 50 per cent interest . <p> Getting control of MillerCoors would allow Molson Coors to gain more cost savings in the U.S. while continuing to sell Miller 's portfolio of brands along with their own , said Brittany Weissman of Edward Jones . <p> " They 've saved some money but not as much as they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview . <p> Weissman said there 's still lot 's of uncertainty about whether SABMiller will accept a takeover deal .
