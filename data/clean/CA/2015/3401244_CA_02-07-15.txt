a campaign in her name sought donations to reschedule her special day , seeking $5,000 to " create new memories and a new start with our family . "  the campaign started on june 27 but was pulled down thursday following media coverage of the fundraising effort .  in an email to global news , gofundme.com said the page was removed by the campaign organizer .  the couple chose to cancel the wedding to both mourn the nine victims her brother is accused of killing , in what federal authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime , and to protect their family .  " june 21st was suppose to be the happiest day of our lives . it is the day every girl dreams of , it was the day we dreamed of , " roof wrote on a gofundme page posted june 27 . " our wedding day was suppose to be the most important and special day of our lives . it was suppose to start our lives together with our new family . our day was the exact opposite , and shame , tainted by the actions of one man .  " we know money can not replace the wedding we lost and our perfect day , however it will help us to create new memories and a new start with our new family , " she wrote .  according to the washington post , roof contacted police after seeing her brother on surveillance footage publicized after the shooting .  the funds raised , just more than us $1,500 so before being removed , were to have gone toward covering the cost of cancelling the wedding and to send the couple on their " dream honeymoon . " the campaign also promised to donate 10 per cent of the money they raise to the emanuel a.m.e church .  " our lives have been forever changed and touched by all the love and support you have shown us through this difficult time , " the gofundme post read .  dylann roof , 21 , is facing nine counts of murder after being arrested in north carolina the morning after the mass shooting , about 400 kilometres was met with criticism and support .  " i 'm sorry but it is insane to me that you have the nerve to ask people to donate for a honey moon ! look i 'm sorry your brother screwed up your wedding plans , however i 'm way more concerned about the people who lost there ( sic ) loved ones , " a commenter by the name of melissa williams-stewart wrote . " they are trying to afford to bury the people they loved due to the stupidity of your brother ... if i 'm going to donate it will be to the families that lost there ( sic ) loved ones . "  " what did you do ? delete the comments ? you do nt deserve any sympathy for your poor missed wedding . your racist family killed innocent people ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if i saw you or your parents id spit in your faces ! ! ! ! ! , " read a post by scott howell .  but there have been 31 people who have donated the largest contribution being $200 .  " i am so glad to have you as a life long friend . you are such an amazing woman &amp; deserve all the best things in life . you 're one of the strongest people i know ! michael and the kids are so lucky to have you ! love yall , " contributor nicole chmielowski wrote on the page .  another contributor wrote he was donating because of the recent supreme court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in the united states .  " me and my partner finally have the opportunity to legally get married after dating for 5 years . i can not imagine how upsetting this would be . please accept my small donation as a token of my support , " wrote corey parks , who donated $10.
