<p> Researchers looking for answers about why so many people in the Northwest Territories are n't going for cancer screening found patients pointed to a lack of access to , and a lack of a long-term relationship with , their health care professionals . <p> Only about half of eligible people are being checked for breast or cervical cancer and only 20 per cent are being screened for colorectal cancer . <p> For the past year a research team from the University of Alberta talked to 368 people in two N.W.T. communities , asking questions such as " Have you used the health centre in the community ? " , " How did you feel ? " and " Did you feel listened to ? " <p> Dr. Gita Sharma , who is leading the project , says some of the main reasons they heard for why people are n't getting screening were that there are too few health care professionals in the community , and those that are there do n't stay long enough . <p> There was also the fear of what a cancer diagnosis could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go away from your family and friends and go somewhere like Edmonton or Yellowknife for treatment , " she said . " That takes you away from a supportive , loving environment . " <p> Researchers also asked for suggested solutions . In response , people said they want more permanent health care workers and they want things explained in plain language . <p> This included " using local languages and using languages in a way that was understandable to a regular community person instead of something where the doctor might talk at a level that some of the community members could n't understand , " Sharma said . <p> Sharma will present the study 's findings in Yellowknife at the end of the month . <p> Note : The CBC does not necessarily endorse any of the views posted .
