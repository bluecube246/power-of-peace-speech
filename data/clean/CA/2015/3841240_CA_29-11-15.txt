<p> AMSTERDAM - Ajax protected its three-point lead at the top of the Dutch Eredivisie by beating PEC Zwolle 2-0 Sunday . <p> Frank de Boer 's team has struggled against Zwolle in recent meetings , including a 5-1 humiliation in the 2014 Dutch cup final . But it was Zwolle that had trouble containing a rampant Ajax before the break , with only profligacy in front of goal keeping the score even . <p> Viktor Fischer squandered good chances in a first half in which only Amin Younes found the net . The Germany youth international broke the deadlock in the 37th minute by converting Mitchell Dijks ' cross at the far post . <p> Substitute Thulani Serero completed the victory four minutes from the end . <p> " It 's a shame we were n't four or five ahead at halftime , " said De Boer . <p> Second-place Feyenoord beat local rival Excelsior 4-2 in a Rotterdam derby Saturday thanks to an early strike from captain Dirk Kuyt and a hat trick by striker Michiel Kramer . <p> You can comment on most stories on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments .
