With the transitioning to a full-time fire service , there is little wiggle room elsewhere for major projects with operating budget coming in at just over $18 million , the mayor said .  The budget is lean on big-ticket items . Some of the pricier expenditures are $250,000 for the Hwy. 404 employment lands plan , $100,000 for the Nokiidaa trail extension and $140,000 for operations centre servicing .  The single largest increase in the budget comes from the hiring of two full-time firefighters , the budget shows .  The town implemented a plan to transition to a full-time fire service in 2014 with the goal of moving from six full-time firefighters in 2013 to 20 by 2018 . It hired six in 2014 , two in 2015 and plans to hire an additional two in 2016 , 2017 and 2018 .  To fund this transition , town treasurer Mark Valcic has proposed the budget carry a 1.75-per-cent annual tax increase .  To date , council is following Valcic 's model by agreeing to 1.75-per-cent increase for emergency services in the 2015 services ready for when new development comes to fruition .  Hackson made a point to thank town staff for their efforts in getting the budget passed before the Christmas break .  " It 's a very long , tedious process . We are really pleased with the results , " she said . " I want to thank all staff for their work on the budget . "  The 3.7-per-cent tax increase comes in slightly lower than the 3.95-per-cent tax increase in the 2015 budget . The 2014 budget had 2.4-per-cent hike , while the 2013 budget came in under 2 per cent .  Simon Martin is a Reporter with the East Gwillimbury Express . He can be reached at smartin@yrmg.com .
