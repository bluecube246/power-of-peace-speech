Organizers say the men 's health fundraising campaign reached its peak three or four years ago .  In 2012 , it raised $42.4 million , according to records filed with the Canada Revenue Agency . Last year it raised barely over half that -- $23.3 million .  This year , the Movember Foundation had raised only $12.9 million by Nov. 29 .  The short life of a fundraising idea  Normand Bourgault , a marketing professor at the University of Quebec in Outaouais , says these kinds of campaigns do n't have a lot of staying power .  " The life cycle of a fundraising idea , of a fashionable idea , is quite short : two , three or four years , " he said .  " After that , you have to come up with a new idea or new concept that adds something to the original idea . "  Bourgault drew a parallel between Movember and the Ice Bucket Challenge , which raised millions for ALS research after sweeping social media last year . He said trends tend .  Rendall Sylvain-Hernandez , who runs a communication firm in Gatineau , Que. , grew a moustache for Movember in 2014 . This year , he decided to pass .  " My way of participating now is educating friends , relatives , family and not by growing a moustache , " he said , adding that when he grew one in 2011 he was in university with friends , and " it was funny . "  Broadened focus  Patrice Lavoie , a volunteer spokesman for the Movember Foundation , acknowledged the campaign has lost steam . As a result , the foundation no longer focuses solely on the moustache campaign .  " There are activities all year , " he said .  " We organize activities for Father 's Day and , for example , when soldiers return home from abroad . "  Since 2003 , Movember has raised $677 million worldwide and funded over 1,000 projects focusing on prostate cancer , testicular cancer , poor mental health and physical inactivity , according to the foundation 's website .
