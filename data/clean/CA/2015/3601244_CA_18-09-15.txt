revisiting the past lives of st. lawrence market  in the november 5 , 1803 edition of the upper canada gazette , a notice from lieutenant-governor peter hunter addressed an irritant for the early inhabitants of york : " no place or day having been set apart or appointed for exposing publicly for sale , cattle , sheep , poultry , and other provisions , goods and merchandise , brought by merchants , farmers , and others , for the necessary supply of the said town of york . "  the solution : starting that day , a public open market pdf would operate every saturday at the northwest corner of present-day front and jarvis . nearly 30 years later , in 1831 , the first permanent brick building opened on the site , a structure which ringed an open courtyard . elements of that incarnation of north st. lawrence market , along with its successors , have been uncovered through archaeological work carried out as part of the preparations for the fifth market building to stand on the site .  model of 1831 st. by ryerson students for the " meeting places : toronto 's city halls " exhibit at the market gallery in 1985 .  beyond its role as a trading centre , the north end of the 1831 marketplace housed toronto 's first city council chambers after the city 's incorporation in 1834 . but the complex had its problems , especially for butchers : the height of the gallery exposed their meat to the sun ; damp and poorly ventilated cellars also provided lousy storage . space was so tight that farmers were turned away , forcing them to sell to grocers , causing a loss of civic revenue . part of the balcony collapsed in july 1834 during a tax riot . the solution was the construction of a new south market building , which politicians and produce vendors moved into in 1845 .  the original north market complex was destroyed during the great fire of 1849 , and was replaced within two years in a project that also created st. lawrence hall . that structure met its end in 1904 , replaced by one designed to match recent canopy above front street linked the two markets , as the north side settled into its role as a saturday-only farmers market . construction was a bureaucratic nightmare , from cost overruns to the firing of the architects ; as a star editorial put it , " the city 's interests were being looked after by too many men , so that among them all nobody gave the work the determined attention it deserved . "  bricks from the 1904 incarnation of the market .  when the next version of the north market was completed in 1968 , some tenants were happy to see the demise of the poorly aging 1904 building . " gone was the dirt and dust , " the telegram observed . " gone was the roof which sometimes leaked . the cold and the gloom , the shabby walls and uneven floors had departed . instead there is brightness under-floor heating and colour everywhere . the farmers have never had it so good . " opening reviews were mixed , with architectural critics giving the space thumbs down for being too mundane .  1968 building as it awaits its end . its placement atop a thin concrete pad made finding its earlier incarnations easier for archaeologists . based on the three trenches made in the floor , you do n't have to dig deep to find the foundation piers from the 1831 complex . " nobody had popped the lid to have a look at the what the preservation was like under the site , " archaeologist dr. peter popkin noted during a media tour of the site on wednesday .  part of the 1851 sewer system .  popkin and golder associates ltd. conducted the current stage of the archaeological assessment over the past few weeks , and found elements of all pre-1968 structures within the trenches . besides the original foundation piers , other uncovered features include the 1851 sewer system , and bricks , concrete foundations , and a box drain from 1904 . evidence points toward the existence of the cellars which irritated butchers during the 1830s . while items like animal bones and ceramics have been found , their volume is less than would be discovered at a evidence of " robber trenches " where fill was dumped during each construction project , especially from 1904 .  showing the different surfaces over time -- the darker area is believed to be the outdoor courtyard surface of the 1831 market .  one interesting find was the discolouration of levels of dirt , especially in the second trench . the darker stained soil was the original surface of the 1831 interior courtyard . while paving stones were contemplated , according to popkin , visitors reported it was covered with gravel . the evidence points to a sandy material with plenty of pebbles sitting atop a clay capping .  at the media tour , deputy mayor pam mcconnell ( ward 28 , toronto centre-rosedale ) referred to the discoveries not as " surprises , " but as " prizes " which will help tell the story of the city from their respective eras . up to 18 months of historical assessment work was built into the timeline for the new market structure , leaving plenty of time for further investigation and a mitigation study . it is expected that new building . it shall be seen how the discoveries affect plans for a 250-space underground parking lot .  city of toronto coat of arms , installed 1968 .  as it awaits the wrecking ball , the 1968 building feels like an archaeological relic . the tour provided one of the last opportunities to survey it , to notice touches easily overlooked on a busy saturday morning like the old city coat of arms mounted above the stage . the waterlogged floor of the space which housed the snack bar . a floor painting honouring buskerfest . the banner inviting visitors to check out the temporary farmers market to the south . time will tell if this incarnation of the north market will be the least mourned .  additional material from the september 19 , 1904 edition of the toronto star and the february 1 , 1969 edition of the telegram . unless indicated , photos by jamie bradburn/torontoist.
