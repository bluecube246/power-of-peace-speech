two students from jordan and singapore are the first recipients of the international scholar award , a new scholarship that enhances u of t engineering 's ability to attract top students from around the world .  the award covers full tuition and is renewable for up to four years . it recognizes students studying abroad who have exceptional marks , are involved in extra-curricular activities and want to use their engineering degrees to improve the world . tamara abugharbieh ( year 1 engsci ) and katherine bancroft ( year 1 general first year ) are this year 's winners .  another first-year student , minh tue pham ( year 1 engsci ) , received a u of t international scholar award , which is open to students from any faculty .  " on behalf of the faculty , i would like to extend my heart-felt congratulations to katherine , tamara and minh , " said dean cristina amon . " engineering challenges know no borders , and our ability to draw exceptional students from other countries enriches our faculty and enhances the global perspectives u of t engineering has increased substantially over the past decade thanks to the faculty 's strong global rankings , targeted recruitment strategies and scholarships aimed at students from abroad . international students comprise 30 per cent of this year 's entering undergraduate class , and more than one-quarter of the total student body comes from outside canada , representing 109 countries .  u of t engineering caught up with the three scholarship winners , as well as an upper-year international student , to find out how they are enjoying the year :  tamara abugharbieh -- engineering science  abugharbieh , the child of two engineers , was raised in jordan . she was always eager to follow in her parents ' footsteps . at school , abugharbieh was a member of the robotics team and won a medal for innovation and critical thinking . " i enjoy researching projects that help improve society , " she says .  while working on a school essay , abugharbieh came across the writing of u of t alumnus malcolm gladwell . she was inspired by his thinking , and by laureate john polanyi . " i saw u of t as a place where i can learn how to become an innovative thinker and a leader of change , " she says .  abugharbieh received the news of her acceptance with " bouncing and dancing . " she enrolled in engineering science , a program known for its academic rigour . while she admits it has been challenging , abugharbieh says the close-knit community of students is a great source of strength . " it is creating a special bond between me , my colleagues and the program , " she says .  in the future , abugharbieh wants to specialize in energy systems engineering , and ideally carry her knowledge back to her home country . " jordan and the middle east in general have a great solar energy resource that needs investment and technology , " she says . " my dream is to be a jordanian pioneer or entrepreneur who transfers knowledge or creates a spinoff company in this area , which is desperate for a breakthrough . "  katherine bancroft -- general first year culture kid , " was born in toronto but has spent significant portions of her life living in sydney , australia , and singapore . she became fascinated by engineering design in high school when she toured a chemical engineering lab and saw a " switchable solvent " designed to help clean the material left over from oil sands extraction . " the link between applied science and environmental sustainability definitely captured my interest , " she says .  what attracted her to u of t was the vibrant nature of the skule community . " the diversity and inclusiveness , coupled with the fun traditions , made u of t a place i wanted to be , " she says . " the opportunities available through the professional experience year and the incorporation of design from year one made the engineering program especially appealing . "  bancroft is enjoying the challenge of first year , particularly the variety of her courses . " there 's something different going on every single day , " she says . bancroft has volunteered at hi-skule 's mentorship coffeehouse , which brought from undergraduates like her . she has also joined iron dragon , the skule dragon boat team , and plays flute in the lady godiva memorial bnad sic .  bancroft plans to use her u of t engineering degree to address global issues such as water scarcity and sustainable use of resources . she sees herself working for industry or in research , ideally collaborating with people across many nations and cultures . " i believe that economic growth and environmental sustainability need not be mutually exclusive , " she says . " i hope to work to make this more of a reality , especially in developing nations . "  minh tue pham -- engineering science  pham was born in vietnam , and from an early age showed an immense passion for mathematics and natural science . " i was captivated by their power to express and describe the world , " he says . in high school , he co-created and managed a volunteer community service organization , which showed him the importance of working to improve society and shifted his career aspirations from theoretical science t by the quality of its education and the reputation of the engineering science program . he likes that it combines theory and practice and provides valuable exposure to many disciplines within engineering . pham has not decided what discipline he will pursue , but his favourite courses are civil engineering and computer science . " my favourite thing about u of t is how easily approachable the professors and the teaching teams are , " he says . " i feel very comfortable coming to the engsci office to chat with my student counsellor about the future . "  outside class , pham is participating in the game , a competition run by the institute for leadership education in engineering ( ilead ) that aims to identify a problem facing society and design a possible solution . " working together with completely new teammates , most of them upper years , has proved to be a very valuable experience , " he says .  as for the future , pham sees many possibilities . he may choose civil engineering , computer engineering or something else . he may my engineering background with my newfound passion in business and economics to start up a firm all of my own . " wherever he goes , pham is sure that his u of t engineering education will prove invaluable . " i believe that it will give me the necessary knowledge and skills to take on any challenge after i graduate , " he says . " the possibilities are endless . "  ernesto diaz lozano pati ? o -- year 4 civil engineering  diaz lozano pati ? o has engineering in his blood : his father , uncle , great-uncle and great-grandfather were all engineers . but for pati ? o , who was born and raised in mexico city , studying engineering at home was not enough .  " in the movie the motorcycle diaries , they say ' let the world change you , and you can change the world ' , " says diaz lozano pati ? o , who is president of u of t 's engineering society . " i saw coming to canada as my opportunity to let the world change the excellence of the faculty members as one of the best things about his u of t experience . " the civil program is absolutely wonderful , " he says . " i have been amazed at how tightly knit the department is , and how much the professors care to connect with their students . "  like many international students , diaz lozano pati ? o plans to use his education to address challenges that apply to both his home country and to other places around the world . " i see myself helping build the cities of the future , " he says . " we live in a world full of inequality ; it was almost impossible for me to believe , when i was in mexico , that there were people living under cardboard roofs a mere hour drive away from the some of the wealthiest people on earth . we need change , and i believe engineers will be instrumental in leading this change .
