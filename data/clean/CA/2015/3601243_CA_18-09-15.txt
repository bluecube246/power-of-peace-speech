But sometimes , things work out . <p> Like when the weather finally breaks , and after two weeks of dreary rain Environment Canada 's webpage has lots of little suns . <p> So you load up the camper and head down the road to Haines Junction , on to the Kathleen Lake campground in Kluane National Park . You pause for a moment to enjoy the breath-taking scenery , note the fact the clouds are breaking up , and head to the campground to make the circuit in search of your home for the night . <p> All of the sites at Kathleen Lake are outstanding ; the distance from your neighbours and the beautiful picnic tables that are the feature of every site have spoiled you . But as you cruise around , the spark of one long-held dream starts to flicker : could Site 27 be available ? <p> Site 27 is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's huge -- bigger than most city housing lots , with the fire pit located off the parking spot , the grounds around it cleared over the years . It may be the most beautiful campsite in the world , and in two decades of coming to this campground it has always , always been occupied . <p> But what 's this ? There are no RVs parked in Site 27 ? No trucks and campers ? Not even a dread-locked cyclist cooking quinoa over his impossibly tiny camp stove ? <p> There 's a tag on the post , which usually indicates the site has been bought and paid for and tonight 's occupant went to the liquor store for " supplies .

So you do what any normal Yukoner would do in this situation . <p> You freak out . <p> You open the back of your van and begin flinging camp chairs around Site 27 like a tornado just hit a Oklahoma trailer park . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin shoving money into the box like a dazed bus tour passenger in front of the slot machines at Diamond Tooth Gerties . You ca n't believe your luck . <p> Even when you bow to pressure and go on a hike up the King 's Throne rather than simply sit down and enjoy your conquest , part of you is convinced you 'll come back to Site 27 and find your van a smouldering ruin with a cruel message left on the picnic table : You are not WORTHY of Site 27 . <p> Then the clouds break and you walk over to gaze at the lake , which so many people have done this at Site 27 there 's a little path to the view . You can see deep into St. Elias Mountains , brilliant white against the now clear blue sky . That night the clouds vanish completely , and you gaze up at more stars than you 've probably even seen in your life . <p> Note : The CBC does not necessarily endorse any of the views posted .
