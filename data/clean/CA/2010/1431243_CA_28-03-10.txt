THN.com Blog : Sutters must pay for Calgary ? ? ? s failures  Brent Sutter 's first year behind the Calgary bench has been anything but a success . ( Photo by Gerry Thomas/NHLI via Getty Images )  Brian Costello 2010-03-28 10:10:00  The time has come for the Calgary Flames to bid adieu to the Sutters .  Though still mathematically alive to make the playoffs , the fact of the matter is the Flames have regressed in giant steps this season and have no business competing for the Stanley Cup . And for that reason , GM Darryl Sutter and coach Brent Sutter must pay the price with their jobs .  Expectations were high in Calgary this season , mainly because the Flames had five solid cornerstones and a defense-oriented coach with a winning resume . Captain Jarome Iginla and goalie Miikka Kiprusoff are among the best in the business at their positions . And with a defense than included Dion Phaneuf , Jay Bouwmeester and Robyn Regehr -- all among the final 10 or so rearguard candidates for the Canadian Olympic league .  GM Sutter 's task was to supplement the five pillars with serviceable role players and coach Sutter 's job was to implement a system that got stronger and more refined as the season progressed . Both Sutters failed and with a 2010-11 payroll that 's already at $53.4 million , it 's hard to imagine improvement next season .  Perhaps GM Sutter 's greatest undoing -- not just this season , but since taking the job in 2003-04 -- was not finding the right player to center Iginla . Craig Conroy worked for a while , but was never a long-term solution . Daymond Langkow had back-to-back 30-goal seasons centering Iginla , was signed to a four-year contract worth $4.5 million per season , then bumped to the second line where his production dried up . GM Sutter did the Phoenix Coyotes a favor last season taking underachiever Olli Jokinen and his $5.25 million contract off their hands -- giving up a first round draft pick as part of the return .  The intention was good , but Jokinen never panned out under coach Sutter 's York Rangers . Problem is , the players he got in return , Chris Higgins and Ales Kotalik , have scored just three goals in 30 games since . And sadly , offense-challenged Kotalik is on the books for $3 million each of the next two years .  It 's tough to fault anyone for the rapid disintegration of Phaneuf as a defenseman in Calgary . The 24-year-old former Norris Trophy candidate became totally lost in his own end without the puck and stopped generating much offense -- and did n't respond to coaching . Convinced the Flames could n't win with the cornerstone system , GM Sutter dealt Phaneuf to Toronto for depth players , which is n't a bad notion , but then he signed Matt Stajan to a $14 million contract over four seasons and Stajan went on to prove he ca n't produce on the top line with Iginla and Rene Bourque ( Stajan 's Calgary stats prorated over a full season are 13 goals and 51 points ) .  Niklas Hagman is a serviceable second- or third-liner , but even his production has been Calgary ) . Jamal Mayers is playing well on the energy line and Ian White is a marked all-around improvement on Phaneuf . Sadly , though , the Flames have just $3.8 million in cap room next season -- assuming the salary cap stays at $56.8 million -- and six roster spots to fill . Those spots include fourth-liners Eric Nystrom and Mayers , two more forwards , a backup goalie and White . Keeping White is a priority because of the trade and that 'll cost in the neighborhood of $3 million .  Since the influx of new players , the Flames have won 10 of 19 games , which is n't enough to make the playoffs any season , unless you factor in that loser third point .  Ironically , it 's Brent Sutter 's failings as a coach that are making his older brother 's managerial moves look bad . The Flames clearly have n't bought into coach Sutter 's system . Perhaps it 's too archaic in today 's transition to aggressive offense , employed by the game 's exciting teams . For sure the 28 shots per game , fifth worst in the league .  Since January , the Flames have the league 's most anemic offense . And that has to be routed back to coaching . But then , coach Sutter has shown a litany of shortcomings , from Phaneuf falling off the rails to Jokinen not meshing in , to the third-worst offense , the sixth-worst power play , the second-worst faceoff percentage . And aside from White and Mayers , the new players are n't making a difference .  What 's worse , the Flames may not pick ' til the fourth round in this June 's draft and there 's not a lot of jaw-dropping skill in the development system . Only Mikael Backlund and Ryan Howse look like second-line skill players .  For those reasons , it 's time for the Flames to move past the Sutters . Fortunately the time is right because Steve Yzerman is a GM in waiting and Ken Hitchcock is looking for a coaching job . Both men worked well together for Team Canada at the Olympics .
