Building the football Blues  A large group of students at Timmins High &amp; Vocational School certainly are .  The Blues football program is currently in the middle of a stretch of practices even though the start of the next season is n't until September .  On Friday , players on both the junior and senior teams took to the field for their second practice . Having had a practice on Tuesday cancelled because of the heat , and another on Thursday because of lightning , the players appeared to have no beefs with spending extra time at school with the weekend ahead of them .  And that 's exactly the mindset Andrew Schroeder wants out of Timmins High when it comes to football . Not only with the players , but also with the student body and faculty .  " It 's more than the team , it 's the program that we 're trying to build and that 's spread throughout the school , " said Schroeder , the newest member of the Blues coaching staff .  " The culture the school gets out and everyone 's behind it . There 's the hockey culture here that 's very strong , but we 're not trying to compete with that or take away from that , we 're just trying to copy some of that enthusiasm and bring it here with what I know from southern football . "  With experience playing at the high school , university and semi-pro levels , Schroeder has seen how the sport has brought people together . In his native Hamilton , seemingly everyone was behind his football team when he was a high school player . His squad even got to play at Ivor Wynne Stadium , the home of the CFL 's Tiger Cats .  " We sometimes take that for granted , " Schroeder said . " That was just the level of expectation when I was in high school , that 's just the way it was . Not that I 'm trying to copy it or mimic it , I 'm just trying to bring a little of that spirit here . "  The Timmins High football got their first taste of regular-season action in September 2007 after a hiatus of more than 30 years .  A glaring problem in trying to get re-established is that they play in the Nipissing District Association . Last season , the Blues did n't have the luxury of hosting a game and had to travel to North Bay for each of their tilts . To do that and be competitive is a " daunting task , " Schroeder said .  " In college , our longest road trip was four hours , " said the former McMaster University centre . " We 're asking high school kids to do what professionals and college students do n't necessarily have to do . "  Thrown in the fact that Timmins High is the only school in the city with a football program makes things even more challenging .  At the same time , being the only team around has its perks . Prospective players around Timmins are attracted to attending the school to be part of the gridiron gang . There have been a few transfers from Roland Michener into it and they want to come to ( Timmins High ) because we 're the only football team in the city , " Schroeder said . " Once that reputation gets out there , that this is a fun thing to do for kids at this age ... they 'll want to come here and be part of the football culture . "  In trying to create excitement for football , the program has had a number of different events , including an assembly and the April Fool 's Day Bowl . One goal the coaching staff is hoping to meet with such occasions is getting more students to join the football team . That would also help to improve the product on the field , Schroeder said .  " I would like to make us more competitive , " he said . " I 'm not going to say we 're going to win and be perfect , but I 'd like the point gaps in the games to be a lot better and field more players . It 's not like basketball where you need 11 are 12 on offence , 12 on defence and 12 on special teams . Adding that up , you need a small army out there . "  Coach Craig Beda said that a number of players that were on the junior team last season will make the jump up to the senior squad , leaving a number of vacancies . By holding practices in May and June , the coaches are able to gauge how large the junior and senior squads will be .  " The seniors have been working out all year and they 're anxious to hit before they start up again in September , " Beda added . " For some of the Grade 9s that did n't play last year , it 's introducing them to the sport , and hopefully we have them back in September . "  If nothing else , Schroeder said the players will benefit by working on their team skills .  " It 's a very team-oriented sport , " he said . " It 's also , believe it or not with all the contact , a of the rules , your team is very heavily penalized , more so than any other sport . So it really encourages a lot of positive play within the rules . It 's the positivity that will lead to the 100% buy-in and growing the football culture . "
