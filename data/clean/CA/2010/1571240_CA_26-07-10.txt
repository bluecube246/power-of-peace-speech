<p> A critical editorial published by Canada 's leading medical journal is the latest move a mounting effort to convince the federal government to crack down on the sale of caffeinated energy drinks to minors . <p> Energy drinks that contain high amounts of caffeine - some more than five times the amount in a can of cola , or nearly double the amount in a cup of brewed coffee - can pose serious health risks to children and adolescents and require stronger warning labels , according to the Canadian Medical Association Journal 's editorial . <p> Caffeine content in common foods and drinks <p> " It is time for the federal minister of health to be awakened and alerted to concerns about energy drinks sold to children , " states the editorial , written by Noni MacDonald , section editor of population and public health at CMAJ , Matthew Stanbrook , CMAJ 's deputy editor , scientific , and editor-in-chief Paul H ? bert . <p> " Strict regulations are required if business practices and consumer trends are not curbed . " <p> The editorial comes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging action . <p> The Medical Society of Prince Edward Island has been pushing for the province to restrict the sale of caffeinated energy drinks to young people . <p> The House of Commons health committee has also been investigating the use of caffeine in energy drinks and other carbonated beverages . In June , it heard from a man named James Shepherd who said his 15-year-old son died from an unexplained arrhythmia ( irregular heartbeat ) in 2008 after he had consumed a Red Bull energy drink . He said he believes the drink contributed to his son 's death . <p> Chris Turner , Health Canada 's director-general of the marketed health products directorate , said the department has received several dozen reports of adverse reactions linked to energy drinks , and that 15 of them were cardiac events . <p> Red Bull is one well known example of a caffeinated energy drink . But as the market has exploded in recent years , a growing number of products that deliver high levels of caffeine are available . <p> Unlike cola drinks or similar carbonated beverages , energy drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , a 250-ml bottle of Coca-Cola contains 26 milligrams of caffeine , according to the company 's web site . But a 75-ml bottle of Rockstar " energy shot " contains 200 mg of caffeine . A 355-ml can of Red Bull contains 113.6 mg of caffeine . <p> Health Canada says children between 10 and 12 should not consume more than 85 mg of caffeine a day ( children 4 to 6 should not exceed 45 mg , while those 7 to 9 should not exceed 62.5 mg ) . Healthy adults should n't consume more than 400 mg a day , the department says . <p> It does n't have specific limits for teens because it says there is " insufficient data , " but recommends caffeine consumption for that group not exceed 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight . <p> Excessive caffeine consumption can lead to irritability , loss of sleep or nervousness . But there is also concern that its stimulating effects can cause rapid heat rate , an abnormal rhythm or other problems that could have serious health consequences . <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that makers of energy drinks regularly target young consumers through event sponsorships and promotional materials . <p> Health experts are also concerned by the fact many young people may mix energy drinks with alcohol , a potentially dangerous combination because the stimulating effects of caffeine can allow an individual to drink more over a longer period of time , which could lead to alcohol poisoning or risky behaviour . <p> Caffeinated energy drinks are sold as natural health products in Canada . They must undergo a review to determine they are safe and effective and those that are approved have a licence number printed on their label , according to Health Canada spokesman Gary Holub . <p> But since there is a major backlog of products to be reviewed and approved by Health Canada 's Natural Health Products Directorate , the government has allowed many to go on sale while waiting for approval . That could mean some energy drinks and other natural health products on the market have never been reviewed for efficacy or safety . <p> But Mr. Holub suggested some energy drinks could represent a section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in an e-mail that Health Canada is " reviewing the latest information and safety data on energy drinks and reassessing the labelling requirements for these products . " <p> Red Bull and other companies that sell caffeinated energy drinks did not respond to requests for comment . <p> Refreshments Canada , an industry association representing beverage makers , issued a statement saying companies that sell caffeinated energy drinks are responsible and do n't engage in marketing campaigns aimed at children . It states that energy drink labels clearly indicate the products should not be consumed by children and that the products have been approved for sale in more than 100 countries . <p> It also sent a letter to Dr. H ? bert stating the CMAJ 's editorial wrongly insinuates that energy drink makers target youth or are unregulated . <p> " Energy drinks are intended for adults and clearly indicate on the label that this category of beverage is not recommended for children , pregnant or breastfeeding women and people who are sensitive to caffeine , " Refreshments Canada president Justin Sherwood said in the letter .
