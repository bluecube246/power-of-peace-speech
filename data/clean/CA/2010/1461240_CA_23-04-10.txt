Suspected gunman at pot protest linked to gang  A suspected gun-toting man with four court prohibitions from having a firearm and arrested in Dundas Square during a pot protest is tied to the Point Blank Souljahs gang .  The gang was formed in the Regent Park area and some of its members have dispersed throughout the city .  The suspect was tackled and disarmed by his intended target and others during the Tuesday afternoon gathering at Yonge and Dundas Sts .  Toronto Police recovered a 22-calibre semi-automatic pistol .  The intended victim , rapper Da Genius , was whipped with the gun before lunging at the suspect and ripping the pistol out of his hand . The victim 's friend , Billy Burnz , jumped in to help hold down the suspect .  Before Genius was attacked , the suspect allegedly said , " I am a G. " The letter could be short for gangster .  A police source said the suspect is known as a member of the Point Blank Souljahs .  Burnz said he and Genius n't know him .  " Oh , wow , " he said when told of the suspect 's affiliation . " Yeah , I know of them . "  As for Burnz , he said he and his friends have turned to " the positive . "  " I guess that 's what the dude failed to realize , that 's why he came out like that , not knowing that people like ( us ) ... might have been ( intimidated ) in the past , but now we 're in the positive , we ca n't let innocent people get hurt , " Burnz said .  " You can look at it as that I 'm at a higher level now in the sense of the things I 'm doing now . "  Burnz said he can judge himself by the success he has had in his music .  He said others will slowly have to realize that " no matter how bad or scary a person thinks they are , there 's always somebody scarier or badder , so I guess they Blank Souljahs apparently splintered from the Regent Park Crew , and have had their share of violent battles , primarily with the Project Originalz , based in the Vanauley Walk housing complex in the Spadina Ave. -Dundas St. area .  Donovan Wynn , 33 , is charged with numerous firearms offences , four counts of possessing a firearm contrary to a prohibition order and threatening death .  In September 2008 , Wynn was jailed for nine months after being found guilty in Superior Court of using a firearm , possession of a pellet gun while prohibited and uttering a death threat for a June 2007 incident . He was sentenced to 37 months but was given 28 months credit for 14 months pre-trial custody .
