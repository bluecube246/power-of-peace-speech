The cause of the fire is under investigation . <h> Sun Run : Fortifying the body 's foundations <h> Strength training helps prevent injury and improves performance <h> Michelle Roots demonstrates the finishing position for the side plank exercise at her home gym in Surrey February 8 , 2010 . <h> Photograph by : Ric Ernst , PNG <p> Adding a little strength training to your running and walking program will help you prevent injury and increase running efficiency . <p> " It 's like building a strong foundation when building a house , " said Surrey certified strength and conditioning specialist Michelle Roots of Core Conditioning . <p> " You need to start from the bottom . If all your stabilizer muscles are strong , you 're creating a stronger foundation , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Strength training will also help your body withstand the impact forces of running on hard surfaces , Roots said . <p> Start with just a few simple exercises . Try to do them two to three times a week on your non-Sun Run training days . When you 're starting out , the first thing to focus on is proper form . Try to do the exercises perfectly . <p> Runners and walkers are prone to overuse injuries often caused by muscle imbalances . One of your goals is to even out some of those imbalances to help prevent injury and improve performance . <p> When out for your training runs and walks , remember to warm up your muscles before starting . Warm muscles work more efficiently . <p> Walkers <p> Goal : Strengthen your lower body , particularly the front and back of your thighs , to decrease strain on your ankles , knees and hips . <p> Exercise : Wall squats . Stand with your back against the wall , feet about a foot and a half away from the wall . Keeping your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall until your knees reach a 90-degree angle and your thighs are horizontal to the floor . Hold for three to five seconds , slide back up . Repeat . <p> Goal : Strengthen core . When you 're tired or have a weak core , you tend to collapse forward , your head goes down , shoulders roll forward and the spine curves in , creating lower back pain and decreased breathing efficiency . <p> Exercise : To strengthen your core muscles , lie on your back , knees bent , feet flat on the floor . Notice the gap between your lower back and the floor . Imagine someone is pulling a string from your belly button into the floor . Squeeze your abdominal muscles until you feel your back flat against the floor and the gap has disappeared . Hold this position for five seconds . Repeat nine more times . <p> Runners <p> Goal : Focus on hip strength . The stronger your hips are , the more stable your pelvis will be . If your hip is unstable , your pelvis can become misaligned or unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles . Every time your foot hits the ground in a run , if your left hip is n't strong enough to hold your pelvis stable , that hip will sway outward and other body parts will need to compensate for that weakness . <p> A common injury among people with weak hips is lliotibial band friction syndrome . Weak hips cause strain on the IT band which is a fibrous band that runs from the hip down the side of the leg to just below the knee . When this band is irritated from overuse , you may feel pain on the outside of the knee . <p> Exercise : Strengthen the gluteus medius to create hip stability . Stand facing a mirror . Raise one foot off the ground . Watch the opposite hip . You do n't want it to pop or sway outward . Squeeze your butt and hip to keep the hip in . Hold five to 10 seconds . If this becomes too easy , stand on an unstable surface such as a pillow . <p> Intermediate runners : <p> Goal : Work on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own weight . You might be surprised to find how your right side , for instance , might be covering for a weaker left said . Focus on increasing core strength . <p> Exercise : Try a side plank that works your shoulders , core and hips , one side at a time . Lie on your right side with your right elbow on the ground . Lift yourself up into a plank so your body is in a straight line and your weight is resting on your elbows and feet . Squeeze your abdominals and butt . Hold 20 seconds , then switch sides . If this is easy , you can balance your elbow on a ball or another unstable surface . <p> You could also do some one-legged squats to increase single leg strength , and lunges instead of squats so you can focus on hip and knee alignment in one leg at a time .
