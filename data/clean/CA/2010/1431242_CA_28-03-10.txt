Don't die from embarrassment

<p> Somewhere in a small medical room near here , there is even video evidence should this debate end up in court . I am an empty vessel , clean as a whistle , good to go for another few years . <p> But I have no intention , thank you , of putting my butt up on Facebook for all the world to see . <p> That , however , is what the Colorectal Cancer Association of Canada is asking people to do this Wednesday in a campaign they are calling " Buttmob " that will bring an end , no pun intended , to a solid month of making Canadians more aware of what has become the second-leading cause of cancer deaths . <p> Getting people to smile about something as personal as their own rear end is not a bad thing . Colon Cancer Canada uses " We 're behind your behind " as its slogan . Virginia gastroenterologist Dr. Patricia Raymond gives comical speeches as " The Devine Ms Butt Meddler " to get people to at least open up their minds to opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jokes about getting a colonoscopy : " Are we there yet ? " ; " Let me know if you find my dignity " ; " Could you write a note for my wife saying that my head is in fact not up there ? " <p> Jokes help get to the seriousness of the situation . Some 22,000 Canadians will be diagnosed this year with colorectal cancer . More than 9,000 will die from it . Yet a stunning 90 per cent of this cancer is curable if caught early enough - and the only way that will happen is through the rather undignified screening process . <p> This was my third time wearing the charming backless hospital gown and waiting while an assembly line of bums went in for the obligatory scan by **25;55;TOOLONG . It being a different hospital with different procedures , this time included sedation . I do n't recall a thing . It was like being back in the Sixties . <p> My brothers and I get it because there is family history . Sister Ann - a much-loved fact checker at Maclean 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - died of it at age 50 . Her gift to her siblings is that we get checked regularly . <p> As one brother puts it , " The ' prep ' is much worse than the procedure " - meaning the 24 hours when you dissolve and drink a couple of packets of magic powder , ca n't eat anything and would n't dare venture more than five strides from a toilet . <p> For obvious reasons , " screening " has long been a tough sell for the medical community . People do , it turns out , die from embarrassment . <p> With all the bad publicity that hockey has had over heads these past weeks , it is a delight , then , to report a story about bums that truly inspires . <p> The Windsor Spitfires , last year 's Memorial Cup champions , used their March home games to get the message out . The players , including Taylor Hall , the probable No. 1 NHL draft pick come June , all wore uniforms with a " Colon Cancer Check " crest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the campaign . <p> At breaks in the play , Spitfires general manager Warren Rychel came on the scoreboard , telling the fans to " Get checked , " over video showing Rychel checking various NHL superstars during his playing days with the Los Angeles Kings . <p> Between periods , local pharmacists had information booths where they provided free the fecal occult blood test kits that allow for a simpler screening to be done in the privacy of one 's own home . A positive test here would call for a full colonoscopy later . <p> Rychel figures the message was hitting the perfect target group : the team 's 5,000 seasons-ticket holders , mostly men aged 40 to early 60s . <p> " We were aiming for the fan base , " agrees Dr. John Day , head of the Erie St. Clair Regional Cancer Centre that worked with Cancer Care Ontario to set up the program with the Spitfires . But Day also came to the dressing room and talked to the young players about the devastating effects of this cancer , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " These kids know what tragedy is , " says Rychel , referring to the team 's loss of its captain , Mickey Renaud , who collapsed and died at home two years ago . <p> " The knowledge those kids get will stay with them the rest of their lives . " <p> Day says the hope is that one day people will be able to talk about getting screened without " turning red " - and he 's hoping that the Spitfires ' successful campaign can spread right across junior hockey ranks just as the NHL 's Hockey Fights Cancer program has raised awareness of screening for breast cancer . <p> As for the 42-year-old Rychel , his team 's campaign even reached an unexpected target : himself .
