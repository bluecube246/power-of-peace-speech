In 2010 , Canadian hip-hop icon Buck 65 ( n ? e Richard Terfry ) is celebrating 20 years since his first proper release . To mark the occasion , he 's unveiling an EP series called 20 Odd Years , whereby he intends to release 20 new songs spread across five EPs and embark on a 20-country tour . Since starting the series earlier this year , Terfry has released three EPs : Avant , Distance and Albuquerque . The next EP in the series is called Cenotaph , and sees Buck 65 collaborating with three distinct guests , including Gentlemen Reg , violinist Emily Wells and French pop star Olivia Ruiz .  Perhaps the most interesting track on the release is Buck 65 's cover of the Bronski Beat 's 1984 anthem " Smalltown Boy . " The track stemmed from Buck 's early desire to include a cover song , and he made up a list of 75 track possibilities to choose from . To narrow it down , he tested audiences on some U.S. and European tour dates .  " I playlist , and then between songs I would play little clips of the songs , and I would explain to people that I wanted them to tell me which would be the most awesome to cover . It really came as a surprise to me , but I found the song that was getting the biggest reaction was ' Smalltown Boy ' by Bronski Beat . Everywhere I went , people would go nuts . I do n't know what that says about my audience , because it 's a song from the early ' 80s , which is probably before the time of a lot of people coming to my shows . "  With the song idea pegged , he had to find someone who could live up to the inimitable singing of Bronski Beat 's Jimmy Somerville . " His voice is so incredible , so I had to think of a singer that would fit right into that pocket . I thought about it for a while , and then I remember specifically the moment that Gentleman Reg popped into my head because it was a really he did n't hesitate . "  With Reg carrying the chorus , Buck decided that he 'd make the track his own by rapping over the verses without throwing out the original song . " I figured out a not-completely-faithful version of the song and added some verses I wrote of my own while keeping the instrumental and chorus part of the song the same . It all came together beautifully , and Reg just completely knocked it out of the park . It just gave me chills when I heard it . "  The EP series is a testament to the creative renewal Buck 65 is having at this phase in his life . With a steady day job hosting CBC Radio 2 's Radio 2 Drive , Terfry has had less financial expectation from his musical endeavours .  " I feel like I 've kind of returned to the same thinking as where I started , just doing this because I have to and because I really love it , " he says of his creative process . " I always expected that a day would any more ... Suddenly when the pressure was off the creative juices really started flowing and I went into the most prolific phase of my life . It was the most fun when I just got all thoughts of money out of my head , which was a combination of getting a job and the way the music business was going . "  Once Cenotaph is released on September 14 , Terfry already has his fifth Buck 65 EP far along in the process . Though he 's hoping for another handful of big-name collaborators , he 'll only give us one so far : Bucky Award-winning singer and Exclaim ! cover star Hannah Georgas . From there , he has mentioned that he 's considering a proper album this winter , which is expected to include a Buck 65/Gord Downie collaboration .  Still , the prospect of releasing EPs indefinitely is equally alluring . " I 'm starting to think now I would just keep going forever if I could . "
