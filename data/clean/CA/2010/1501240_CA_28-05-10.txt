<p> " Please take a number off the wall and step into the booth , " advises a sign near the back of McTamney 's , the historic Church St. pawnbrokers . <p> The place does n't smell like an old shoe , nor does it emit any Dickensian musk , though McTamney 's has been at this location since 1916 , and before that was around the corner on Adelaide St. One hundred and fifty years young this year , and still a family business . <p> The buy-and-sell business . There 's that . <p> And the pawnbroker business . <p> " You have to start with your price , " says Floreen Shortt , who runs McTamney 's with her husband , Christopher . There 's a photograph of James McTamney , Christopher 's great-grandfather , above her desk . McTamney 's daughter , Olga , married Maurice Shortt . Everyone called him M. J. " He was going to wrap the books up and sell it , " says Floreen of M. J. 's plan to wind up the business . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in charge every since . <p> It seems such an anachronism , pawn brokerage . A dying trade . But in his just-released Broke USA , Gary Rivlin writes that the pawnshop business -- part of what he calls Poverty Inc. -- in the U.S. is booming as the citizenry struggles under the weight of historic financial woes . <p> Flo Shortt would n't care for the poverty characterization . " We 've always said this is a smart financier 's way to do business , " she says . <p> Enter the pawn wicket . Name your price . <p> The negotiation begins . <p> " Rolexes are coming through constantly , " she says , sitting in her office in a white pant suit and a tangerine top , her hair short and frosted . " Sometimes it 's just for tuition for university . " <p> A watch worth 10 grand might get you a $1,000 loan . Maybe two thou . " Ideally you receive a fairly minimal amount . . . We want you to come back for it . " <p> The rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pawnbroker is committed to keep the item for a year -- they ca n't sell it prior to that point . Between 85 and 90 per cent of customers come back for their goods . <p> So how 's business ? <p> " When there was a dip in the markets we did have a rush , " Flo says . " But people kind of hung tight for a while to see what was going to happen . Now things are getting a little tighter and they 're having to borrow again . The banks are tightening up on their lending , so you have to figure out another way ( to borrow ) . " <p> Many years ago Flo herself was turned down for a bank loan . She never forgot it . " I said to the bank manager , ' Thank you very much . You 're the reason I 'm still in business . ' " <p> Who 's her customer ? " If anything we 're seeing a shift to the middle-aged group , higher income . . . They seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There are four clients at the wickets . A guy has just sprung his bicycle from pawn . The shop is bright and clean and polished . <p> Should you forget to retrieve your Ping clubs at the start of the season ? " We like the good stuff , obviously . If we 're going to be left with it , that 's what we want to be able to sell . "
