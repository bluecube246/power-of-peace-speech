group therapy is a relationship advice column that asks readers to contribute their wisdom . each week , we offer a problem for you to weigh in on , then publish the most lively responses , with a final word on the matter delivered by our columnist , lynn coady .  a reader writes : i 'm moving to the caribbean with my husband and five-year-old son for the next two winters ( september through may ) . i am 42 and i still have not been able to tell my mother . i know she will find a million reasons why it 's a bad idea . i know that every attempt to persuade her otherwise will be met with : " i know , but i just worry . " and i know that she will spin herself into a debilitating depression that will affect not only me , but my sister and father . even if i tell her i 'll be there on the next flight if she needs me , it wo n't put my mother at ease . how do give her tools to cope  it sounds like there are two problems here : a ) mom has some separation issues and b ) you feel that you need her permission to act on your own thoughtful but perhaps controversial decisions . mom needs to hear that you have made a careful decision and that you are firm on it . you do not need to accept guilt . focus on her separation issues and the ways that you can support her ( e.g. , setting up e-mail , skype , buying her phone cards , setting up a trip for her to visit ) .  - janice mackenzie , indian river , ont .  follow through  you 've essentially answered your own question , though the hard part is following through . your mother has some emotional imbalances , and you 've rightly identified that there is no reason she should make you feel guilty . yet filial bonds have a way of overruling logic , so you have pre-empted her and guilt-tripped yourself by inventing the idea that if you leave , you will cause sure they have long ago developed their own coping strategies . tell your mother calmly what your plans are and refuse to get into a discussion . that 's the easy part . now for the hard part : enjoy your warm winters and ignore her phone calls .  - jeff meyes , san francisco  bite the bullet  you are 42 , so presumably your mother is at least 60 . that makes you both adults who are  responsible for themselves . if she will truly experience a debilitating depression over this , then her mental state should be addressed asap . speak to your father and sister first , so that everyone is on board with a plan that includes a couple of caribbean visits . bite the bullet and tell your mother ; anticipate frostiness and wait for her to sort of come around . welcome your family when they visit , and enjoy every minute with your husband and son . these will be memories you will all treasure .  - kathy christenson , toronto  the final word  if i did consist of only three : you are 42 .  now , all that remains is to pad my response like a grade 12 essay on poor parenting choices in king lear .  king lear is the story of a young woman who refuses to let a bullying parent walk all over her . the parent in question promptly goes crazy and dies - something all guilt-ridden children secretly fear will happen should they dare stand up to a parent . why ? probably because , like lear , the guilt-tripping parent often responds to such insubordination with histrionic avowals that he or she will promptly go crazy and die .  so it 's not as if your fear of revealing your plans to your mother is irrational . heck , manipulative parents have been flogging lear 's thankless child/serpent 's tooth line since - well , since shakespeare . obviously , you 've experienced this toxic behaviour in your mother before and know what she is capable of .  but once again : you are 42 .  you ca n't indulge this foolishness . to indulge it . lear went around the table demanding each of his daughters kiss his butt and cordelia responded by telling him , in so many words , to kiss hers . you must , in so many ( loving , patient ) words , tell your mother the same thing . or as kathy puts it : bite the bullet .  jeff says to ignore your mother 's phone calls during the caribbean winter months while janice stops just short of recommending video-conferencing . that 's up to you and your own level of tolerance . the important thing is to let your mother know you wo n't be drawn into emotional head games . tell her it 's fine and perfectly motherly of her to worry - but you 're going to the caribbean ! to spiral into depression and make her entire family miserable over your temporary absence is beyond absurd .  like lear 's youngest daughter , you have to stand against the absurdity . but the hardest part of taking a stand is the knowledge that your brave action is n't necessarily going to change mother will still , to put a final literary flourish on my essay , go ranting into the storm when she does n't get her way . let her . you wo n't be able to enjoy full-fledged adulthood until you can .  lynn coady is the award-winning author of the novels strange heaven and mean boy , with another one currently in the oven .  next week 's question  a reader writes : i 'm divorced , late 40s , deeply in love with a divorced , early 50s man who brings much happiness and laughter to my life . but he was cheated on in the past , and whenever we have an argument it ends up with him following me around ranting and yelling in my face . one evening , after he had too many drinks , he cursed loudly at me when i accidentally stepped on his toe . i did what i always do when the mood changes between us - i become distant and then he starts demanding that i show some love . the night is shot , yet the self . but i need time to shake off the hurt . that 's when he starts yelling . he wants affection but i just want to run , which makes him angrier . how can i defuse his bullying ?
