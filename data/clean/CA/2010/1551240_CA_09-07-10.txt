<p> Caribana 's crowds do n't just come for the beats and the glittery , shaking booties . If anything 's worth lining up for on a hot day , it 's the authentic Caribbean cuisine , prized for the home-cooked flavours that translate into excellent street nosh . Whether you 're at the official parade or a guerrilla-style blocko , go beyond the standard beef patties - here 's our guide to the delicacies you wo n't want to miss , and where to get them . Avoid filling up on a dinner-sized portion of anything - you 'll want to save room for sampling . <p> Dish : Roti <p> National origin : West Indies <p> Why you want it : Toronto has an ultra-competitive roti scene , with various East and West Indian and Jamaican restaurants vying for the crown , but the best of this flatbread-wrapped curry stew is always the kind Grandma makes . The key is in the hand-rolled dough : " The skin should be soft . You should n't have to pull it with your teeth , " says Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers are divided into two camps - those who order it boneless , and those who want the bones kept in . The latter is the more " authentic , " admits Famous Recipe owner Kevin Mohammed , who brings his special mango-tamarind chutney and his 20-inch cast-iron pot in from Hamilton every year to feed hungry revellers by the parade on Lake Shore and at several other events . " The flavour is so much better with the bones , but you have to use your fingers , " he says . " It gets messy . " <p> Dish : Jerk chicken <p> National origin : Jamaica <p> Why you want it : Recipes vary , but the flavour relies on two key ingredients : allspice and nostril-singeing Scotch bonnet peppers . Look out for the kind cooked over charcoal in an oil drum : " That 's about as authentic as you can get , " says Carl Cassell , co-owner of Harlem restaurant , who heads up to the vendors at Eglinton and Oakwood for a fix year-round . <p> Dish : Fish cutters <p> National origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former chef at Amuse-Bouche , gets nostalgic for his homeland when he talks about flying fish cutters - the Bajan word for sandwiches in salt-bread buns . " You rub the fish with a mix of Bajan seasoning , green onions , lime juice , thyme and oregano , bread it , and fry it , " he says . " It 's really , really tasty . " Get it with roasted corn and lots of rum , of course . <p> Dish : Oxtail stew <p> National origin : Jamaica <p> Why you want it : Off-cuts may not be your thing , but this is an island dinner staple . Beef tail , a bony , gelatinous cut of meat , is slow-cooked over several hours and melts into buttery , tender chunks . Every family 's recipe is top secret . Allette Betton of Matchless Catering , a popular wedding caterer and Caribana favourite , says she uses a signature mix of six different spices , but do n't ask her what 's in it . " If I told you , I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubles <p> National origin : West Indies <p> Why you want it : Cheap , filling and hot , this is the ultimate Trini street dish , a sort of chickpea sandwich made from curried channa between two pieces of fried dough , hence the name . The bana - the bread - should n't actually be bready at all , but spongy , pillowy and chewy , yet structurally sound enough to contain the filling . Toppings can include tamarind , hot pepper sauce or fresh cucumber , but bonus points if you get shado beni chutney , made from a cilantro-like Caribbean herb . Traditionally eaten for breakfast , doubles are often gobbled down as a late-night calorie hit ( or any time in between ) . <p> Why you want it : This furry-sounding concoction is actually a beverage made from pur ? ed sea algae , mixed with milk and flavoured with vanilla , strawberry or peanut butter . Get it fresh or canned : it 's famous for its supposed aphrodisiac qualities ( the brand name Big Bamboo is a giveaway ) . It 's said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Dish : Fresh coconut <p> National origin : All over the Caribbean <p> Why you want it : Vendors might charge a pretty penny to stick a straw into a nut , but it 's cheaper than a plane ticket to the islands . The sweet juice of young green coconuts is full of electrolytes - ideal after a long day of jump-up - and some sellers hack open the nut with a machete so you can scoop out the jelly inside . <p> WHERE TO GET IT <p> Whet your appetite at the official launch party at Yonge-Dundas Square ( Thursday , 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. , free ) . But street food central is undoubtedly the parade route , which starts at Exhibition Place and heads west on Lake Shore Blvd . ( July 31 , 10 a.m. to 6 p.m . ) . Bypass the big chains and pizza vendors and head to Lake Shore near Jameson . " That 's where most of the mom-'n ' -pop booths are , " says Caribana publicist Stephen Weir . They 're your best bet for authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where vendors will set up inside and outside Lamport Stadium for the King and Queen Show ( July 29 , 7 p.m. , $30 , 1151 King St. W. ) . The party rages on there for the post-parade f ? te ( July 31 , 6:30 p.m. $25 ) .
