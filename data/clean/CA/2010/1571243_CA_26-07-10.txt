<h> Negotiating when , and if , getting a tattoo or piercing with your teenage child has not only become more common , but complicated too . <p> A tattoo is seen at the back of a woman during the International Tattoo Convention in Bogota June 5 , 2010 . <p> By:Beth J. HarpazThe Associated Press , Published on Mon Jul 26 2010 <p> NEW YORK , N.Y . -- One day your kid wants a new bike . The next day , a new cellphone . Before you know it , your little darling is as tall as you are , demanding pierced ears or even a tattoo . <p> Pierced ears , you say , what 's the big deal ? In some cultures , girls get earrings as infants . But how do you feel about pierced ears for a boy ? Or five holes in one ear for a girl ? <p> As for tattoos , these statistics might surprise you : 22 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men said they had tattoos in a 2004 survey published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are higher among young adults : Tattoos were reported by 36 per cent of 18- to 25-year-olds and 40 per cent of 26- to 40-year-olds in a Pew Research Center survey from 2006 . <p> But among 41- to 65-year-olds -- the demographic most likely to have teenage children -- only 10 per cent reported having tattoos . <p> So how do parents of teens , most of whom probably do n't have body art or untraditional piercings themselves , cope with kids who want nothing more than to look like LeBron James ? Tattoos and earrings did n't hurt his job prospects , so can you really argue that nobody will hire your child because of a flower on the shoulder or a stud in one ear ? <p> Shelley Davis Mielock , who works with colleges and corporations on dress codes as part of her image-consulting business in Lansing , Mich. , says parents should point out that tattoos and unusual piercings are still frowned upon in some industries and segments of corporate America . Disney employees , for example , are not permitted to have visible tattoos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what your future holds , " said Mielock . " I am not against tattoos or self-expression , but other people are going to form perceptions of you based on these things . I recommend if you 're going to get a tattoo , get it where you can cover it up . " <p> Mielock has two tattoos but has not allowed her 17-year-old son to get one . " He argues that I am being a hypocrite , but this is a decision I made as an adult and I made it knowing the perception other people could have , " she said . <p> Parents should also research state laws . Some states prohibit minors from being tattooed altogether ; others permit minors to get tattoos only if they have parental permission or if a parent is present . <p> You might also point out that tattoos are not as easily discarded as video games or out-of-style shoes . J. Kim Wright told her daughter , then 15 and living in Chapel Hill , N.C. , that she could get a tattoo as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She wanted Betty Boop for a few months . Then Tweety . She is now 26 and has no tattoos , " said Wright . <p> Kathy Sussell , like many parents , made the argument that as long as her teenagers were dependent on her financially , they had to live by her rules . " It 's my house , " said Sussell , of Brooklyn , N.Y . " If they needed to get pierced or tattooed , they could find another place to live . " Her kids are now 20 and 23 , " and I think they are happy today not to have tattoos . " <p> But aside from rational reasons -- legalities , health , future careers -- experts say it 's also OK for parents to simply set limits based on what matters to them . <p> " I am not a believer in giving in to all kids ' demands , " said Dr. Fran Walfish , a family psychotherapist in Beverly Hills , Calif . " You say that the rules and practices are different in every family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bummer , but this is what our family believes . " <p> She added that " nobody likes to be told what to do , or forced or over-controlled , so you need to say it clearly , but with empathy for how hard it is to be told what to do . " <p> Maggie Macaulay , a parent educator and parent coach who leads an organization called Redirecting Children 's Behavior in South Florida , also recommends setting reasonable limits while " side-stepping the power struggles when it comes to issues like this with teenagers . Make it a discussion so it is n't laying down the law . " <p> You might ask your child why he or she is so interested in earrings or a tattoo . If you think you might agree to , say , pierced ears when the child is older , Macaulay recommends saying , " I am not ready for you to do that now , " while promising to reconsider in six months or a year . <p> Some parents have a more relaxed view . Dianne Sikel of Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear pierced . " He 's now 10 and rarely wears ( an earring ) , but I do n't think it was a big deal , " she said . " It 's a tiny little hole . " <p> She feels a little differently about tattoos . She got one when she was 18 , and now , at age 41 , is considering getting it removed . " I do n't think tattoos are that big of a deal , but I am happy that he does n't have a permanent tattoo at 10 , " she said . " Instead , we stock up on temporary tattoos like crazy . " <p> Susan Tordella of Ayer , Mass. , does n't approve of tattoos , but three of her four children -- now all young adults -- have them . " If they want a tattoo or piercing , they 're going to find a way to do it eventually , " said Tordella , who writes a blog about parenting at RaisingAble.com . <p> She still thinks parents who are opposed to tattoos should let their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're underage and hope that if they do get one , it 's " in an obscure place . " But she added : " There are many worse things they can do to themselves besides piercings and tattoos -- which are not fatal , self-destructive or addictive , " she said . " Do n't make it a big deal or power struggle . That will only make it more attractive . "
