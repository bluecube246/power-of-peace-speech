Chargex was the first card aimed at Canadian consumers , but it almost never got off the ground . Hard to imagine today  " Yes , I would say it was a tipping point . I never thought of it that way , but that 's exactly what it was . "  That 's Griff Thompson , casting his mind all the way back to 1968 when , as research director at advertising agency McCann Erickson , he was part of the group charged , if you will , with launching the nation 's first full-service credit card .  Chargex .  An edgy , go-go sort of a name sprung from Group X , a boutique offshoot of McCann , housed in the Lothian Mews . The creative types at Group X spent a lot of time at the Coffee Mill there . Thinking .  The group 's writer , a guy named George , would get a faraway look in his eyes . " Everything was in metaphor , " says Dennis Bruce , who was art director . " That good , " says Griff Thompson . The name being Chargex . " It sounded like whatever I 'm not going to pay right now I 'm going to charge to my account . "  One of the group 's challenges was this : how to introduce the nation to " the working man 's credit card " as the Star would refer to it , as distinct from the businessman 's credit card , American Express ?  Click-click .  That 's the sound of an imprinter being run across a plastic credit card , pre-magnetic strip , the signature sound of the card 's commercials . " I have this theory about advertising , which is , if you can create a mnemonic device , you 've got a burr in the brain , " says Bruce . " It almost never leaves you . "  And , unlike , say , the Eaton 's card , or Esso -- " Happy Motoring ! " -- consumers could use their Chargex card to purchase everything from antiques to yard goods from a wide array of participating category out of business and putting it in the hands of consumers , " says Stu Eaton , once McCann 's chairman , now long retired . The name Chargex , he points out rightly , " was both original and explanatory . " Sharp . In contrast to , say , a name such as Visa , a good name for a car , Eaton thinks , or maybe a line of diet foods .  Back to free money . What was not to love ?  Consumers did not love the idea . " People said , look , if you 're going to bring out another card we 're going to cut it up , " Bruce recalls . He wonders if debt aversion was part of the reason why . In pre-market surveys , as many as 60 per cent of respondents said they did n't want it .  " Usually in my business when you get a 60-per cent resistance , nothing goes anywhere , " says Terry O'Reilly , ad guy and co-creator of The Age of Persuasion on CBC Radio . " . "  The prognosis was grim . " It 's going to be a flop , was sort of the take we had on it at the time , " says Bruce .  Four banks were on board , which meant that Group X had to wrangle reps from the bank of Commerce and the Royal and the TD and Banque Canadienne Nationale all in one room . The group would rotate , bank to bank to bank , each trying to outdo the other . The wine ! The meals ! Egos being what they are , the ranks of the big swinging banks grew and grew until a meeting room had to be reserved at the Park Plaza Hotel . " It got to a point where the meetings would erupt into arguments backwards and forwards , " says Bruce . " Terribly embarrassing for the clients . "  The initial ad campaign was built from two angles . One : appealing to customers -- " You can furnish the living room . Buy a violin . " Two : appealing to merchants -- " Cancel busy this year . " Shoppers newly armed with Chargex would be running shopkeepers off their feet -- that was the idea .  Debt ? Well , the adverts made a delicate suggestion : " Cardholders may make small monthly payments if they prefer . " At a 1.5 per cent rate of interest monthly .  Click-click ! Gold mine !  Group X 's television commercials are lost , like much of the story , to " the mists of time " as Dennis Bruce likes to say .  But that sound . Will that be cash or Chargex ? Click-click ! That stays with us . " That mnemonic was so catchy and sticky , " says Terry O'Reilly . It burred right into the brain .
