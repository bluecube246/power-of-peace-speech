PETERBIO A fish called Walter  All the kids will be hoping to snag ' Walter ' at this weekend 's Greenwing fishing derby  Walter the Big Fish  Lance Anderson  Walter , the big fish all the kids are trying to catch at the annual Greenwing Fishing Derby .  Greewing derby 1  Lance Anderson  Victoria Beasley , 2 , reacts as Walter flips out of his net during the annual release of rainbow trout into the lift lock canal on Wednesday ( April 21 ) . The Greenwing Fishing Derby runs this weekend along the canal .  SIDEBAR  Walter was named after a trout from a 1981 American drama film called On the Golden Pond . The movie won several awards including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Henry Fonda also won an Oscar for best actor , while Katharine Hepburn took home the an Oscar for best actress .  What : Greenwing Fishing Weekend  When : April 24 and 25 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily .  Where : registration fee for children 15 years old and younger . Each additional child in the same family costs $5 at time of registration .  That 's right , the popular big fish that all the kids are hoping to snag during the annual Greenwing Fishing Weekend is a woman .  Always has been and always will be .  Fact is , female rainbow trout live longer and grow bigger than their male counterparts . According to Jennifer Penhale , Walter 's girth is what sends children into frenzy .  " I do n't think to many kids have the opportunity to get that close and see a big fish like that . I know for my son it 's about the thought and the chance that he can catch something that big , " explains Mrs. Penhale .  Megan , 3 , and Kathryn , 6 , joined their mother near Lock 19 to watch 5,000 trout be dumped into the Trent Canal on Wednesday ( April 21 ) . About a half-dozen youngsters waited in anticipation to see the top prize at this weekend 's and centre when event co-chair Gordon Bowley revealed the 10-pound fish to the public .  " He is my favourite fish . He splashed out of the net and dived onto the sidewalk , " said an excited Megan .  Walter has been the infamous rainbow trout since the inception of the derby -- originally held at the Jackson Park pond before later moving to the canal . Nearly 5,000 anglers will line the canal between the Lift Lock and the Maria Street swing bridge to try and bring the trophy fish to shore .  " The biggest difference is she 'll be in a much larger body of water . Our set up is quite natural here but she will really enjoy the additional space , " says Ms Taylor , explaining that Walter was one of 2,500 female rainbow trout eggs fertilized in a incubator with the milt from a male rainbow trout . Thirty-eight days later Walter 's life began . Little did she know she would become famous in the eyes of children and adults alike six years later . She received no special , Walter was removed from the incubator and placed in a small trough with flowing water when she started to swim . There she lived off her yolk sack for a few weeks before starting her commercial trout diet .  " They start with 54 per cent protein , which is a huge amount compared to other animal feed . Probably why Walter gets so big , " says Ms Yaylor , noting the protein comes from fish oil .  As Walter grew , the Linwood staff moved her to a various sizes off holding tanks where she could swim comfortably .  " At age two they go into the pond for a couple of reasons . It 's heathier on their fins because the pond has a mud bottom and they like being in the natural light , " adds Ms Taylor .  She says between the ages of two and three are when females are examined to be potential spawners . It 's unknown if this year 's Walter was used as spawner but her days of maybe producing a future Walter are likely over egg production decreases and their not economically worth keeping as far as producing eggs goes . One of her eggs from the past ( if she was a spawner ) could turn out to be Walter one day . A former Walter could well have been her mother as well , " says Ms Taylor , explaining large fish that ca n't produce anymore are used as trophy fish at fishing derbies .  " She was the biggest fish in a pond of about 200 and that 's why she became Walter . "
