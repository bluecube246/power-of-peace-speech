James: Mississauga needs watchdog 'group of seven'

<p> Hazel McCallion has n't campaigned this hard in decades , if ever . But the matriarch of Mississauga is n't rustling up votes to deliver her 12th straight term as mayor ; rather , she 's working to defeat the only shadow of opposition she 's had during a 32-year reign : a pesky group of seven led by Carolyn Parrish . <p> If McCallion succeeds , it will be a huge blow to democracy and a boon to the self-importance , greed and entitlement that has now come to roost in the mayor 's office . <p> Voters should reject this petulant , self-serving bid from their mayor . Residents do n't " put Mississauga first " by populating city council with a company of compliant yes-men and -women . <p> Just what are the sins of Nando Iaannica , George Carlson , Carmen Corbasson , Sue McFadden , Frank Dale , Eve Adams and Parrish ? They dared to challenge McCallion 's right to ignore all conventions of conflict of interest and promote a lucrative development project fronted by her son on lands near city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to probe how the pension fund giant OMERS managed to get a veto power over the city-owned hydro utility , even though OMERS was a minority shareholder ; and how this veto clause was inserted without council approval ; and how the mayor signed this clause , contrary to the document council approved . <p> To spend one day at the Mississauga Inquiry , listening to McCallion and her real estate broker son , Peter , testify and obfuscate and skate around clear answers to clear questions is to know the " group of seven " should be applauded . <p> It is they , not McCallion 's cowardly backers such as Katie Mahoney , Pat Saito and Patricia Mullen , who should be re-elected and given the keys to preserving the city 's good name . <p> It 's a waste of paper and ink to advocate that voters turf McCallion for one of her 10 challengers -- though there are capable replacements among them , such as Dave Cook . What bears saying , though , is that McCallion is totally misguided in her attempts to neuter the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing Mississauga needs is a compliant , boot-licking , submissive council of followers -- not now , in the twilight of McCallion 's career ; not at a time when new ideas and visions should begin to surface and define the next 30 years ; not when there is mounting evidence that Hazel 's one-person regime had significant flaws . <p> McCallion 's rule has been good for Mississauga . But the judicial inquiry will probably conclude that it came at a price . Hazel refuses to see that public interest and private interest must be separate . <p> She fails to separate friends and social buddies and dinner partners and developers . She mixes business with pleasure . She runs interference for and negotiates business extensions for her son 's company -- all in the name of what 's good for Mississauga . And the said company just happens to be the only one that has never had to pay up-front development fees ( $440,000 ) for the massive project it once planned as it began making its way through city hall . <p> " I started opening lids on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way Parrish explains her leadership in search of transparency at city hall . <p> It 's not surprising that the old guard wants to hold on to the ways of the past . They benefitted greatly by hanging on to Hazel 's skirt . She 's taken good care of her friends . An example : <p> The city 's utility , Enersource , had two city councillors and a number of citizens on the board . Unlike Toronto Hydro , where city councillors do n't get extra pay to serve as board members , Mississauga 's two politicians drew in an average $47,500 in compensation . That is above what was already among the highest compensation for city councillors in the country . <p> There 's more . The city manager also pocketed $38,000 -- on top of the six-figure city salary -- to sit on Enersource one Tuesday afternoon a month . <p> The problems started when Parrish tried to end this practice , only to have OMERS inform the elected officials that the company , not the elected officials , controlled the salaries . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city manager and friend and confidant of the mayor -- who signed it but does n't know what she signed and claims not to know the veto existed -- is one subject of the inquiry . And rightly so . <p> Embarrassed , McCallion tried to short-circuit plans to call the inquiry and failed . She has testified , but almost as a hostile witness , in her disarming and charming way of a powerful octogenarian . And now she wants to punish the councillors for seeking the truth . <p> It 's an odious initiative . Mississaugans would be better off to quietly hold their nose , vote Hazel in one last time , and overwhelmingly return a strong cadre of councillors who pledge to keep a careful watch on the mayor 's sunset years . <p> Parrish is indispensable in that task . <p> Royson James usually appears Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday .
