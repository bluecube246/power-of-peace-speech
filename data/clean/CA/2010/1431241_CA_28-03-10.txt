hipster web-rag 's depiction of iqaluit irks local youth  " nunavut teenhood , in a frozen and depressing nutshell "  chris windeyer  angnaluaaq " tia " friesen , an 18-year old nursing student from iqaluit , has started a facebook group calling on vice magazine to pull a web-log story about teenage life in the nunavut capital . ( photo by chris windeyer )  " what if it was -50c outside , booze and drugs are almost triple what they are in the rest of the country , and a bunch of your friends committed suicide because they got dumped ? " the story reads . " that 's nunavut teenhood , in a frozen and depressing nutshell . "  the piece also describes the smell of maktaq as " sweet , rotting , flesh-garbage " and claims that kids go snowboarding " in tank tops when it 's -- 35 c and get sunburned . "  angnaluaaq ' tia ' friesen , an 18-year old nursing student at nunavut arctic college , called the story " pretty insane . " to nunavut for some southerners , and while the article has streaks of truth throughout , it 's insulting to imply that all teens ever do on weekends is get wasted .  " i 've never been drunk , " friesen said . " i 've never been high . "  so friesen 's started a facebook group calling on vice to pull the story . it 's attracted more than 130 members in under a week .  vice magazine originally started as a newspaper-style publication in montreal in the mid 1990s , and later moved to new york city .  among other things , the magazine has published an " interview " with a piece of pasta , instructional stories on how to perform oral sex and a photo of an old man in purple tights urinating on himself .  vice has also written about social issues , politics and war in a decidedly offhand style .  lauren solski , 19 , who lived in iqaluit from the age of 11 until she was 17 , said the article is sloppy journalism . the insensitive to iqaluit 's social problems .  " vice magazine ... claims to be lighthearted and not necessarily following the journalistic values , " said solski , who 's studying journalism at ryerson university in toronto . " it just came off the wrong way because it was just treated without any sensitivity whatsoever . "  solski , along with several other current and former iqalummiut , is depicted in several photos that run with the story , which appear to have been harvested from facebook . she 's not pleased with that either .  an email to vice seeking a comment for this story got no reply . solski said she 's written emails to several staff at the magazine and has also received no reply .  friesen said the ultimate solution lies in young nunavummiut telling their own stories via the arts , making their own movies , journals and books .  " i think nunavut can slap itself in the face instead of having someone else do it , " she said .  " maybe this might be a way for us do n't see , help them realize what nunavut is. "
