<p> There was nothing unusual about Brian Paton 's speech . The former Canadian national fastball star from Woodstock addressed players and fans during Friday 's opening ceremonies at the seventh annual Gord Marshall Memorial Tournament . <p> Afterwards , though , Paton removed his jersey , signed it and donated it to the tourney 's silent auction . It was a selfless gesture to raise funds for cancer in memory of Marshall , who succumbed to the disease in 2003 . <p> " That 's the spirit of this tournament , " chairman Brad Hallock said . <p> The tournament was initially a fundraiser for the Innerkip ladies ' fastball team . In 2006 , the umpires were asked to run the event and decided to use it not only as a means to showcase women 's fastball , but to also raise money for charity . <p> " It 's taken a different focus , " Hallock said Saturday afternoon . <p> Since 2006 , the tournament has become a staple for area women 's fastball teams . More importantly , it has raised over $40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That total will likely approach $60,000 after this weekend . <p> " It 's the secret of the success -- the volunteers and players who contribute , " Hallock said . " The umpires do their thing on the field . It 's the town of Innerkip that supports it . " <p> " That 's a real indication of how teams and the community support it , " Hallock said . " It 's a case of everyone giving back . " <p> The Hamilton Pontiacs led by example , donating over $4,300 and challenging other teams to donate any winnings back to the tournament . <p> " Teams are good about it , " Hallock said . " They 've been here before and they know what we are doing . " <p> The AW Milverton Jrs. have competed in Innerkip the last five years , winning the Tier 2 title in 2007 and 2009 . <p> " Being able to bring out all these teams and people together for a long weekend to support such a worthy cause has touched all of us in one form or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Parsons said . " The Innerkip umpires and volunteers put on a great tournament each year and it is hard for us not to join in on the festivities each year and support ( them ) . " <p> Oxford County teams were well represented . Woodstock Mike 's Electric is one of many teams that have participated each year . <p> " It 's an amazing tournament to play in , probably one of the best in Ontario , " Mike 's player Janine Morrison said . " It 's a good tournament , but it always rains . " <p> Rain wreaked havoc with games Friday and Saturday as thunderstorms soaked the fields and caused delays . The results of the tournament 's championship games were not available at press time . <p> Marshall was a local farmer who was actively involved in the sporting community as an elite men 's intermediate fastball catcher with the Innerkip Eagles for over two decades , as coach and mentor to the Innerkip ladies ' fastball team , as well as an umpire with the local association .
