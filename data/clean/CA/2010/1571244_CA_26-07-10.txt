allen lau is thrilled the rest of the technology world finally caught up .  it was the fall of 2006 , and mr. lau was busy running a small toronto development studio that specialized in building games and other software applications for cellphones , when he heard the news that google inc. had decided to shell out a whopping us$1.65-billion for youtube , a website where anyone could post their own videos .  the year before , he 'd watched as yahoo inc. scooped up a canadian website , flickr.com , where users could upload their own photos . that deal was estimated to be worth about $15-million .  he soon realized there just might be something to this whole " user-generated content " thing .  but with video and photos off the table , and with myspace providing a home for musicians looking to cultivate an online fan space , mr. lau went looking for a media that was lacking an online hub where users could upload their creations and reach out to the potentially vast audiences of the world wide web , and e-books at that time were a very nascent market , " mr. lau said in an interview .  " it was pre-kindle , before the iphone even existed , we saw the opportunity to do something pretty drastic and kind of disruptive and help the little guys out to get the word out . "  unfortunately for mr. lau , his partner ivan yuen and their fledgling startup -- wattpad -- in 2006 the world was n't quite ready for an e-book platform where aspiring authors could write short stories , poems and fan fiction and publish them to the web so that other users could read their creations on their pc or their cellphone .  today , thanks to gadgets like amazon.com inc. ' s kindle , apple inc. ' s ipad and the rapid proliferation of application-enabled smartphones with screens more suitable for reading text , digital books are being pushed into the spotlight , and wattpad is well on its way to becoming the youtube of e-books .  " that youtube deal gave us a lot of inspiration for the business , , the user-generated content space was very hot . it 's still very hot . even today , the bulk of the content on the internet is generated by the end user , rather than professional content producers , no offense to the national post . if you look at all the studies , there are more and more people becoming creators of content . "  today , there are more than 500,000 stories and poems on wattpad , with more than 50,000 more being added every month . the top stories on the site are often read by more than a million users and the company 's applications -- available for just about every platform , from sophisticated android and blackberry smartphones to more traditional java-based devices -- are downloaded more than a million times each month , mr. lau said .  among the most active members of the wattpad community are teenagers , who write everything from vampire fiction to poetry . like youtube , which has spawned online celebrities and mini-communities , wattpad has its own rising stars and niche collectives .  several of the and mr. lau said the site is receiving more attention from the physical publishing industry as it looks to identify new talent with built in fan bases . wattpad recently signed an agreement with macmillan publishers to promote some of the company 's hugo award nominees .  as well , mr. lau is working hard to expand wattpad beyond smartphones and the ipad to other e-reader platforms . earlier this year , the company inked a deal with sony corp . to make some of the most popular wattpad titles available on the technology giant 's popular sony reader digital book device .  currently the site is supported by advertising , but mr. lau said wattpad will experiment with other revenue models in the future .  " advertising pays the bills , but it 's not the endgame for us , " he said .  " to paraphrase twitter and foursqure and all those guys , once you have a billion eyeballs , there are a million ways you can make money . i 'm not too concerned about it . "
