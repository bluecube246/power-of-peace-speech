Until she moved to Canada three years ago , Khayala Karanon had never seen a pizza , let alone scarfed a slice .  Until she moved to Canada three years ago , Khayala Karanon had never seen a pizza , let alone scarfed a slice .  Today she flips over the stuff and can assemble a medium , three-topping , standard issue pie in two minutes flat . She hopes to be rolling in the dough when she and her husband open a Pizza Pizza franchise in London , Ont. this year .  " We have McDonald 's back home but I never had pizza there , " says Karanon of her native Azerbaijan .  " I really love it . "  So how did she rise to the occasion ?  It 's little-known that besides U of T , York and Ryerson , Toronto has another " university " of sorts that provides what its students figure is a well-rounded education in the life of pie .  Sure , it sounds a bit cheesy . But just as McDonald fast food competitor Pizza Pizza -- the largest pizza chain in Canada -- has PPU in Etobicoke , an academic and culinary training centre that boasts 3,500 " graduates " a year .  " I 'm going back to school after 30 years and I 'm loving it , " says Suman Jairath , who is hitting the bright orange books at PPU with husband Chander . Together they are opening a franchise in Orleans near Ottawa after years of running an Indian food restaurant and working at The Bay .  As they 've learned , pizza is an ordinary snack food for most folks , and many assume that ingredients are tossed on haphazardly , depending on who 's making it . Wrong .  There 's meticulous method to this mozzarella madness that keeps franchisees on their toes for six weeks in a red brick building located in an industrial park at Kipling Ave . and Bloor St. W.  It 's equipped with 13 ovens plus food prep stations and a mock restaurant as well as classrooms for lectures and more formal study about all things the key number associated with the franchise is ( 416 ) 967-1111 , thanks to the ubiquitous jingle that has been around since 1975 . ( And if you remember from high school math class , the other number for Pi is 3.14 ) .  At Pizza U the key sequence of numbers is actually 4-3-2-1 , the formula for the single pepperoni pizza slice you would order at the counter , which always has 10 pieces on it . ( That 's four on the base just above the crust right on down to one at the tip of the slice . )  Similarly , a square slice always has five pieces : one in each corner and one in the middle .  A pop quiz that PPU 's director of training Ben Campoli likes to give students -- whose mornings are filled with classroom work and afternoons are spent in the test kitchen -- goes like this :  " Hey guys : How much cheese would you put on a deluxe large classic ? "  The chorus of eager pupils replies : " 8 of mushrooms ? " To which they chirp : " Four . " One keener who has clearly been studying the manual chimes in that this ingredient goes on last so that moisture can escape and prevent the pizza from becoming soggy . Good point .  " I had no idea there was so much to learn , " says Haroon Arif , who works at a Pizza Pizza outlet in Scarborough and is training at PPU to become a manager at a new store in Keswick this spring .  The students begin their first week of schooling with a history lesson on the restaurant chain , whose first store was at Wellesley and Parliament back in 1967 . The second week is more hands-on , starting small with rolling , stretching , saucing and cheesing the dough and making garlic sticks and garlic bread . Week three is all about making party pizzas , squares , wings , fries and chicken bites and learning how to clean the fryer and the filtration system . Week four focuses on the tricky and more time intensive signature pizzas such as six they 're really cookin , ' spending most of their time at the ovens and prep stations and getting tested on their culinary acumen .  They learn the system top to bottom , from handling hazardous material and dealing with H1N1 to how to screw in a light bulb , literally , since special restaurant lighting is ordered from Pizza Pizza 's central commissary along with all the franchisees ' food and other equipment .  Courier Wadie Youssef , 31 , does n't think it 's a mistake to take over a franchise in Montreal amid a struggling economy , although it 's a significant investment .  " People still have to eat . "  A piece of this variety of Pizza Pizza pie costs from $100,000 to $500,000 depending on the location , sales , condition of the store and its track record of profitability . The fee secures the right to own and operate a franchise in a given territory and the use of the Pizza Pizza trademarks , trade name , recipes and retail marketing plan .
