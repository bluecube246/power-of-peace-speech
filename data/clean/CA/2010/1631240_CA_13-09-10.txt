guy maddin haunts the lightbox with his cinematic spooks  guy maddin does n't harbour any particular resentment towards the toronto international film festival for rejecting his first feature , 1988 's tales from the gimli hospital . with the benefit of twenty-plus years of hindsight -- during which time maddin has cemented his repute as one of canada 's most important filmmakers -- the decision of the tiff bigwigs may seem like some great slight . but you ca n't really hold it against them . it 's probably easy to regard an anachronistic 16mm film chock full of necrophilia , buttocks-grabbing contests , and fish-intestine hair conditioner as some bizarre midnight movie oddity , and not a calling card for a cinematic heavyweight . with the modest success of subsequent features such as archangel and careful , and the more immodest failure of 1997 's shelly duval -- starring faerie fantasia twilight of the ice nymphs , maddin proved himself more than just a flash in the pan cinematic curiosity . in 2000 , the festival commissioned heart of the world , a six-minute ode maddin 's " docu-fantasia " my winnipeg with much-deserved best canadian feature honours . now maddin 's back on tiff 's stomping grounds with hauntings i &amp; ii , an installation commissioned for the tiff bell lightbox as part of its essential cinema exhibition .  recalling his project with heart of the world , hauntings has maddin revisiting the styles of filmmakers he has long admired ( many long forgotten ) . a series of silent shorts , hauntings constitutes maddin 's unique imaginings of abandoned , lost , or otherwise forgotten films . it 's a clever complement to the essential cinema exhibition , allowing the lightbox to showcase artifacts that have slipped through the creaky floorboards of cinema 's history . maddin and tiff now have what seems like an extremely healthy relationship , one that over the years blossomed , or at the very least congealed , into an exceptionally productive partnership . we 're all lucky that guy maddin is so willing to dust off the skeletons in his closet . and just as lucky that the big wheels at tiff keep encouraging him to do new " talkie , " the skeletons rattling around in his closet , and the power of " ectoplasmic odours . " torontoist : last time we spoke you mentioned this idea of doing something where you remake lost films or forgotten films . so how did it go from being just this nascent idea to an installation commissioned by tiff ? guy maddin : well i 'd been thinking of doing for a long time . i 've been literally haunted by the idea that there are these really intriguing titles by some of my favourite filmmakers that i 'd never get to see , whether it 's because they 're lost for the time being , or permanently . i told myself years ago that the only way i 'd get to see any version of these is if i made the adaptation myself and watched it.was n't your first commission for tiff 2000 's the heart of the world also a sort of a remake of a lost film ? it was my first wholehearted adaptation of a lost film , abel gance 's la fin du monde synopsis of it and decided to adapt it for my own purposes . i also adapted la roue , also by abel gance , into a short film . thinking it was lost , i made my own four-minute version . but it turns out it had n't been lost . it just was n't available on video . and it was recently released in a four-hour version . so you have my four-minute version and as well as the four-hour original . but these things were never attempted to be remakes ; they were just adaptations . the same way authors of the nineteenth century would do different versions of the same story .  it 's interesting when you say that you finally found la roue on home video . because a lot of times these " lost " films may be finished but just suppressed from release . or they were projects that were abandoned . or there were just rumours about a director working on a secret project . how did you choose which kinds of lost films you were interested in for hauntings ? at first if a film really existed or not . but then , as i once described it to a friend , i became more generally interested in films with no known final resting place . it 's as if these films are condemned to wander the earth in limbo . or they 're resting somewhere in un-consecrated ground . there 's something unholy about them . then i started thinking of the aborted projects . there was hitchcock 's famous the blind man , with jimmy stewart as the recipient of a pair of new eyeballs . and he would see the image of his donor 's murder in them . it was to culminate in a climax at walt disneyland , but walt disney called it off . i guess he did n't want the director of psycho sullying his brand or using it for nefarious purposes . so i liked this idea of aborted projects . and then just unrealized ones . i like this idea of hope withering and dying on the vine . it 's kind of sad as well : kind of the miss havisham of film lumped them all together in a mass grave and then proceeded to exhume these lost , aborted , and unrealized projects.when you finally got around to putting the wheels in motion , which of these films did you exhume ? well , i 'm working on a longer-term project with the american poet john ashbury and the national film board to make over a thousand of these things . but for the lightbox , artistic director noah cowan and i talked about how brand spankin ' new the place is , and how it was n't haunted by any film history or any ghosts yet . so i volunteered to haunt the joint . i sort of put on my curator 's hat and came up with my array of canonical and non-canonical titles that have haunted me over there years . so there 's a mizoguchi , a von sternberg , a lang , an alice guy , an oscar micheaux : just filmmakers that have really intrigued me .  " we talked about how brand spankin ' new the place is , and how it was n't haunted i volunteered to haunt the joint . "  there 's so many more i would love to fit in . ed wood , you know , had so many lost films . alas , oscar micheaux was often called " the black ed wood " and he made the cut because his films were so much more intriguing to me . there 's a lot of stuff about people " passing " for white in his films , and i like the idea of these films " passing " as something else entirely.do you know about the rumoured orson welles batman movie ? think you 'll ever get around to that one ? no ! but i 'm always happy to take a suggestion . orson was going to do a batman picture ? well it 's probably just a rumour or a hoax that has been circulating over the years . but anyway , the story goes that orson welles was going to do the first big screen , live-action batman film . it 's entirely plausible . it seems like the kind of thing he 'd want to excuses not to finish anything.well the story goes that it was nixed because he wanted to play batman , and this was i think in the early 1960s , when he was n't exactly at his physical peak . no ! he was already fumbling through magic tricks on the dean martin celebrity roasts ! but forget orson welles . did you bring this hauntings project to tiff , or did they approach you about it ? well noah cowan approached me and asked me if i wanted to do some magic lantern shows , and i told him how i was thinking about this hauntings project . and it turned out i could give myself a sneak preview of these pieces by doing a few for the lightbox . it happened to work perfectly with what they were planning at the lightbox . noah and i just had a few back-and-forth conversations . it all came together fairly easily.as an installation , how are these films going to be screened ? the films all play in one room , all eleven of them . there 's no soundtrack , because , especially for the security guards . they 're mute ghosts ; scored by whatever sounds the city of toronto brings.so you have a pretty healthy relationship with the festival ? it feels good right now . i do n't want to infuriate other filmmakers with boasts of what a great relationship we have , as if we 're some happily-married couple . but they 've been tremendously good for me and i 've liked working for them . i love commissions . i like deadlines and restrictions . i 've been happy to showcase my films at tiff , always.well did the festival not reject tales from the gimli hospital way back in the day ? they did . but that was a long time ago . current tiff co-director piers handling was there , and current u of t film and women 's studies professor kay armatage , and toronto star film critic geoff pevere . i think those were the three on the selection committee . and i think it was piers and kay versus geoff . but i 've since become great friends with all three of public even . he 's been very elegant about the whole thing.it looks like they 've more than made up for it . it 's like a revenge wet dream , having the festival 's most important power brokers apologizing to you in public . but i do n't need to hear it anymore . i love the guy now.and of course the festival commissioned heart of the world , which many consider your masterpiece . it 's the one movie i 've ever made that turned out exactly as planned . that does n't usually happen with me . it happens with stanley kubrick maybe , but it does n't happen with me . laughs . they 'd all turn out masterpieces if they turned out exactly as i planned them ! do you think that 's a result of it being a short , or a commission ? are you able to be more precise when you have to colour within these lines ? things just fell into place . sometimes i fall into a zone and find myself producing images that i 'm far luckier to get than making shorts and features . i just shot a talkie this summer , which i had n't done in a while.is that keyhole ? that 's right.there was a recent interview with kevin mcdonald where he mentioned it . he plays a sort of gangster in it . it 's a gangster picture in a haunted house . the film is my tribute to the bowery boys , where spooks run wild . it has jason patric , udo kier , isabella rossellini , and kevin mcdonald . and a bunch of other dubious winnipeggers and young torontonians thrown into the mix.do you have any skeletons rattling around in your closet ? any projects that are haunting you and you 'd like to get back to work on ? yeah , i put some of my own aborted and lost and unrealized projects right into the hauntings shooting schedule . i figured that shooting them as four minute movies might be the only way they ever get done . it was fun to exercise these films from my own dusty drawers . and i did n't shoot them on film , are shot on digital ? they are . i had a lot of fun experimenting with different digital looks this summer . plus it 's nice to be able to immediately see what you 've got right there , instead of sending it off to the lab for five terrifying days , waiting for something to come back only to be met with sweet depression and soul-crushing disappointment . i 'm kind of hooked on digital shooting now . but i 'll never throw away my super 8 camera.it must be exciting to work with this new medium , after having so thoroughly tamed super 8 and 16mm and all the other film formats . it 's great . all the happy and unhappy accidents that helped me to develop a style are starting all over again . just when i stopped having accidents , i started having new ones based on abject ignorance . like i did n't know you had to re-format a memory card when you switch it from one camera to another , and i 'd end up losing everything i shot.but eventually you work the kinks in the late ' 90s i learned too much , but enjoyed a renaissance when i un-learned everything in time for heart of the world . but these hauntings reflect that . they run four to ten minutes and some are very tightly edited and some are a lot looser , allowing each one to emit different ectoplasmic odours into the building.guy maddin 's hauntings i is on display in the main gallery of the tiff bell lightbox , which opened yesterday . hauntings ii is being projected on the north facade of the lightbox from dusk ' til dawn until september 19 . stills from hauntings i &amp; ii courtesy of tiff.want more tiff 2010 ?
