<h> Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man : a Q&amp;A with Bill Clegg <p> It was n't a perfect life , but it was a good one . Bill Clegg was a respected literary agent , co-owner of Burnes &amp; Clegg , a boutique agency which represented such authors as Nicole Krauss . He was a recovering addict -- meth , cocaine , pot , crack -- but outwardly , at least , his life seemed to be in order : a loving boyfriend , a thriving business , the support and friendship of many in New York 's literary scene . Little by little , things began to fall apart , until one day , in early 2005 , he realized he was about to lose control . He skipped a flight to Berlin to meet his boyfriend at the Berlin Film Festival and e-mailed his partner , Sarah Burnes , telling her " to do what she needs to do , that he 's relapsed and that she protect herself in whatever way is necessary . " What followed was a months-long crack binge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Clegg 's harrowing new memoir , Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man , is one of the most-discussed books in publishing circles this summer . Chronicling Clegg 's long battle with alcohol-and-crack addiction , it is a bleak reminder of how easy it is to lose it all . <p> He recently traded e-mails with The Afterword . <p> Q : No offense , but you do n't come off as a good guy in much of this book . Did you have any hesitation in putting it all on the page ? Was there anything you held back ? <p> No offense taken . I had no intention of trying to portray myself as an appealing character . The point of the book was to show , frankly , candidly and with as much detail as I could muster , the experience of active addiction and alcoholism . And the experience is not attractive and not pleasant -- for the addict and for the people in his or her life . <p> What 's been the reaction from those people since the book came out ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , Noah , the clients who I work with again , my friends -- at least as they 've expressed it to me , have been supportive . I do n't know the reactions or feelings of those who are not in my life now as a result of my drug use . <p> Looking back now , are you surprised you survived ? <p> I 'm surprised that I survived and amazed that , after , I was able to get sober and stay sober this long . It is absolutely a cliche I would have scoffed at once upon a time : but every day is genuinely a miracle . <p> Speaking of clich ? s , how did you ensure this book was fresh , and not just another " addiction memoir " ? <p> I wrote it privately , honestly and without thinking of other eyes on it . And I tried not to make myself a hero or justify , excuse or even explain my use . I did n't think of other memoirs and I did n't deliberately attempt to make it different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At what point did you tell friends and family you were writing this ? <p> My sister and my closest friends knew about six months before we submitted the pages to publishers . At that point I still was n't sure . I wanted their feedback about the idea of my writing a book about that time and I also wanted the frank , no-holds-barred reaction to the 130 or so pages I wrote before moving forward . So on some level I did n't make the decision alone . It had to be written , I did n't feel like I had a choice once it began , but to have it published was something else altogether . <p> You did n't feel like you had a choice once you began ? That 's remarkably close to the language you use in the book to describe drug use . Was writing this book an addiction ? <p> No , not like an addiction where there is no light , no hope , no creation but something closer to a being given something to deliver somewhere , something that feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and how you get there is like working through a complicated riddle -- frustrating , thrilling , destinations almost coming into view , dead ends everywhere , eventual answers , surprising arrivals . <p> I wanted to get into some more specifics , namely the Penneys , who come to represent paranoia . Was this something you 'd previously experienced -- or experienced again , when you relapsed -- or was this unique to this binge ? Talk about revisiting those delusional feelings for the purposes of the book . <p> I had begun -- in the last few years of smoking crack -- to become increasingly paranoid . Every night would end with me squinting through the peephole of whatever apartment or hotel I was in , getting on my knees and looking under the door for the shadows of possible cops , DEA agents , etc . But until that period of two months there had never been such a sustained , full-blown and intricate paranoid state . One that persisted regardless of where I was -- indoors , on the streets , in airports , airplanes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of dialogue . Specifically , the fact that there 's hardly any quotation marks . Was that your way of calling b.s. on memoirs where the authors seems to have a perfect memory , or did it just suit the story ? <p> Hmmm . I prefer how it reads without quotation marks which reflects how words said surface in memory -- organically , instantly -- more accurately then when they are cordoned off by commas and quotation marks . I would have liked to go without italics even but the publisher was not so keen . <p> You mentioned Noah a little while ago . For me , the book 's most tragic -- and perhaps even beautiful -- moment occurs in what I 'll just call " that " scene . I 'm still not sure if it was the ultimate betrayal or the ultimate display of love . Looking back , how do you feel about that moment . And , since you said he 's still in your life , may I ask if you 're together ? <p> I look at that moment similarly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own actions it serves as one of the most extreme examples of where my addiction took me : to a place utterly without care or concern for anyone or anything but the satisfaction of my own desires . There was an enormous amount being played out psychologically but what matters to me most in that remembering that experience is that on drugs I was capable of betraying the person I loved the most so brazenly , so horribly . <p> We got back together for a year . It followed the year that I spent getting sober , not working , separate from much of my former life . We had no contact during that time . It was one of the most painful experiences of my life . And then he heard I 'd gone back to work , was doing well and he invited me to dinner . He asked me then if we could spend the rest of our lives together now and I said I hoped so , that aside from staying sober it was what I wanted most . What we discovered was that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we thought had been tearing us apart was precisely the thing holding us together for so long . We parted as friends and have become like family . <p> You 're working as a literary agent once again -- I guess you 've been at William Morris for a few years . How difficult has it been navigating the industry this second time around ? I understand you 've since reunited with some of your authors , but I imagine others still hold grudges . And I have to ask , what would you say to Sarah if given the chance ? Do you still regret the way that partnership ended ? <p> Coming back to work was a lucky , frightening-at-first , slow process . There were many relationships -- editors , publishers , writers , friends , new colleagues -- whose trust I slowly regained . There are some who do not and may never trust me . I absolutely respect the decisions of those people or just chosen not to work with me or be in their life . Anything I 'd say to them -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I 've said or will say privately , not in a newspaper or any other public forum . <p> I understand you 're at work on another book ; can you tell us what it 's about ? <p> It 's called 90 Days . Achieving 90 days of consecutive sobriety is a milestone used in many recovery programs . It was the most difficult and most amazing period of my life and the book will give a close chronicle of that period and hopefully illuminate the changes I needed to make in my life and the colossal shift that needed to occur in me to go 90 days without a drink or a drug , and which led to my being able to stay sober now for over five years . <p> What do you want people to take away from the book ? <p> When I think of the people I want to read the book most I think of addicts and alcoholics who are , as I did , struggling alone , ashamed and still convinced they can get a handle on their use . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what seems like the most unique strife is in fact one shared by many and , most importantly , that drugs and alcohol are not manageable . It 's not a fight that can be won or figured out . That in seeing how I tried , again and again , to control how much I used , when I 'd come home , what I 'd do , and failed each time . That the amounts and frequencies increased and that eventually I cared for nothing else but using . If anyone recognizes themselves in any aspect of my story -- the behavior , the feelings -- and is encouraged to step off , get help and avoid where I went with drugs and alcohol , having the book published will have been worth it to me.
