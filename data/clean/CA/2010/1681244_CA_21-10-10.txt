<p> Toronto is a city suffering from structural problems that need to be overcome over the next mayor 's four-year term . The voters now have a choice between two flawed candidates , neither of whom has a convincing account of how he will bring about these changes ; a third does not accept the fact that the city is in any trouble . <h> At the editorial board <h> At the editorial board <p> Rob Ford 's standing in the polls is a loud and clear message from the citizens that all is not well - in particular that they are at the limit of their toleration for new taxes and tax increases . More than any other candidate , he has captured the mood of voters , who are frustrated , even angry . <p> Toronto 's public finances are not sustainable . The city government can not borrow to finance its operating expenses . It can not reasonably impose more taxation on its residents and businesses . If current symptoms persist , its government wages and salaries may well rise by 20 per cent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no longer be appeased . The affairs of the city of Toronto can not be treated as if it were business as usual . They can not be fixed by attrition , by the mere passage of time , or by restraining new spending , or cutting here and there . <p> There is a special problem in the arbitration awards for the essential services of police and firefighters . Their increases are considerably in excess of cost-of-living increases . Rocco Rossi , a preferable candidate who has now withdrawn , has suggested a change to " criteria-based arbitration , " which might require new provincial legislation . In any case , the next mayor must confront this uphill challenge . George Smitherman has shown no inclination to do so . As for Mr. Ford , in spite of his professed fiscal conservatism , he has expressed no concern about the police and fire budgets . <p> Mr. Ford has been a good city councillor for 10 years . He has delivered tangible improvements to his ward , he has been remarkably responsive to his constituents , and he stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small-scale , grassroots virtues are not enough by themselves to solve the ills of a huge metropolis ; he is a retail politician . Moreover , he is an instinctual person , lacking in analysis , and his plans have gaps and inconsistencies . His propensity to impetuous words and deeds could be embarrassing and possibly harmful to Toronto . Nonetheless , the surge in support for a man with these characteristics , in a sophisticated , cosmopolitan city , amounts to an extraordinary indictment of the status quo . It is a phenomenon that all Toronto 's politicians must take seriously ; Mr. Smitherman has already repositioned himself , shifting on the ideological spectrum from where he probably would like to be . <p> Where Mr. Ford is unrealistic , Mr. Smitherman is vague . The risk in supporting Mr. Ford is what he might do as mayor , the risk in supporting Mr. Smitherman is what he might not do . The latter of the two has failed to articulate a vision or a strategy of his own , and he could easily end up as a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , openly promises to be . Still , Mr. Smitherman understands the complexities of multi-tiered government . In the provincial cabinet , he brought no structural change to the health budget - a monster that needed to be wrestled to the ground - though he effectively executed the tasks that Premier Dalton McGuinty assigned him . He is essentially a professional politician , an office-seeker with a taste for managing , but not for transformation . <p> Between elections , the mayor of Toronto must work with three constituencies : the provincial government , the city councillors and the unions . Mr. Ford is likely to be at odds with all three - unless he wins by such an impressive margin that Mr. McGuinty finds it necessary to accommodate him as a de facto opposition leader in Ontario . <p> Mr. Smitherman knows his way well around Queen 's Park and the Liberal Party that is currently in power there . He understands the dynamics of politics as well as of government , and would be better than Mr. Ford at balancing and cajoling the various elements on City Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably appease the unions and seek compromises with them . He should n't . If an unmistakable fiscal crisis breaks out , the aggressive side of his volatile personality may come in handy , at the eleventh hour . <p> Mr. Ford and Mr. Smitherman have similarly unpersuasive and unsatisfactory platforms . In the end , Mr. Smitherman 's ability to get things done makes him the better candidate ; Torontonians may have to live in hope that he tries to do the right things , and that he comes to see the city 's financial predicament as the fight of his life . The electors of Toronto should guardedly opt for George Smitherman . <p> Join Editorial Board Editor John Geiger for an online discussion about this editorial , Friday at 2 pm ET , here .
