<p> And we 're back . Did you have fun over the Labour Day weekend ? I went to a fair and won a rooster crow counting contest and then ate a funnel cake the size of my head . <p> Here we go ! The Where , Why , Wuh ? of the third season of True Blood , along with our hopes , predictions and wildest dreams for season 4 . ( Yes , that Alcide will finally get lucky . ) <p> * Eric has always been a badass , but this time , it 's personal . As he fries in the sunlight outside Merlotte 's , handcuffed to Russell , he learns that Russell killed Eric 's entire family because he needed goats for his werewolves . In today 's currency , that 's , like , well , a whole lot more goats . To recap : Eric has been exacting revenge for 1,000 years over goats . So that viking crown was just a memento ? I 'm the same . After I 've stolen my goats ... GODRIC ! Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is love and forgiveness on the other side , even for goat thieves . Who knows if that 's the last we 'll see of Godric , but he looked pretty pouty when Eric told him that Godric had made him the way he was . From the start ? Or from the point that he betrayed Eric by giving himself to the sun ? <p> Regardless , Eric , refusing to allow Russell any hope for peace in the afterlife , decides that Russell should live with the grief of Talbot 's true death a lot longer , maybe even go mad with nothing else to contemplate -- because he 'll be encased in cement for the next century . Mwahahahaha ! Personally , I love the idea . Vampires already sleep in tight quarters , taking to under the soil when the need arises . But to think that there 's a vampire equivalent to a human being buried alive , only it 's really , really cozy . I can suspend my disbelief on this one . Because when Russell does rise from the rubble , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here ? Sookie does n't want to know him anymore , leaving him with one of the cleanest slates on the show , this after a great revenge story line and the knowledge that while he plays everyone like chess pieces , he would appear to be a man of his word . <p> * Sookie learns that her blood is " vampire crack " and that Bill ( at only 174 years old ? ) is the only vampire " alive " who has the Tantric ability to keep himself from gorging on it . He vows to kill anyone who has ever tasted her . <p> The niftier part in all this is delivered by Eric , who after a season of nudge , nudge , wink , wink , has finally tired of waiting for Sookie to figure it on her own . And it 's gooood . Bill was sent to Bon Temps to get closer to Sookie so that Queen Sophie could walk in the sun again under the protection of faerie blood . And those nasty ol ' Rattrays who tried to drain Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living crap out of Sookie , so much so that she had to feed on Bill , making her his ? Big ol ' set up ! Sookie 's none too pleased to learn this , doubts Bill 's love for her , blah , blah , they break up again , blah . Sookie rescinds Bill 's invitation into her home , only this time he clings to the door frame in the first of two unnecessary wire acts , the second coming later when Bill tricks the Queen ( or was it an undead Mary Poppins ? ) into stopping by for a fae cocktail , only to announce that he was just joshing and really plans to kill her . Cue wire work and up they go . Note : Russell is scarier with only one fang . <p> Not to undermine this development , it is a big plot point , especially for fans of the books . And it will be interesting to see how the Bill and Sookie story line moves forward from here in Alan Ball 's adaptation . <p> * Sookie runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( You totally thought she was going to Bill , did n't you ? I may have yelled at the television . Apologies to my neighbours . ) Sookie says she 's never felt more alone , at which point Claudine arrives to make it all better . There 's one particularly shirtless dude who always seems to be on the verge of a one-shot but never makes it into the frame . I 'm going to keep an eye out for him . Sookie goes to the light . Correction . Sookie makes the light and joins Claudine 's light and the whole lot of faeries ignite the darkness in a wash of more golden light and then -- POOF -- they 're gone . <p> I have two concerns . This whole story line could be the show 's shark . And I wish it had been introduced just one episode earlier . If you 're a fan of the books , you know what I 'm on about . At present , the faeries are a little pastel for my taste . There 's a scene from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear early in season 4 , if not in the first episode , that will establish more clearly what the show has yet to do so far , that faeries are n't just the pin ups of the supernatural world . They carry clout . <p> I 'm also always wary of answers that appear like miracles in one 's darkest hour . The show is littered with them , some which are much subtler , and manageable in a short season . Jesus appearing to Lafayette . Crystal appearing to Jason . The V vial that Andy keeps hidden in his desk drawer . Close Encounters is not subtle . There 's nothing to do but wait and see . ( Beyond this , the faeries should also be able to answer the question of what really killed Sookie 's parents . ) <p> * Tara is riding the high of bacon grease , clearly thinking that there is such a thing as a normal life , when Sam tells her that he 's a shifter . At this point , a PA played a practical joke on the writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for something Tara would actually say , and she goes running back to mama who is caught in flagrante delicto with the Reverend . Man , if this is the last time we 're going to see Lettie Mae I 'm going to have to take a moment . She 's so damaged . I just want to hug her all the time . She 's also the only person on this show to give poor Rutina Wesley a snowball 's chance in hell of performing a Tara we can feel for . ( Sam and Lafayette are right up there , but consumed with their own issues . ) <p> Lettie Mae feels finally that she 's on the ( delusional ) verge of happiness , and the abandonment is complete . Lettie Mae deserves happiness as much as anyone , but it 's come at the cost of having a relationship with her daughter who finally realizes that her mother will never provide a safe haven . Tara will have to raise herself . Symbolically , she pulls a " Felicity , " cutting her hair into bouncier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old car . <p> I was n't sure how I felt about the departure . Sam did something similar at the end of last season when he left to find his birth family . So where 's Tara off to ? Was this intended to keep us wondering ? Was Rutina 's contract up for renegotiation ? I was a bit dissatisfied with her awakening . What happened to that whole rape survivor story line ? It 's a bit too reminiscent of Lafayette being messed up for a few episodes after being chained up by Eric and forced to sell V. But now we 're good ! It 's one of my biggest criticisms about a show that evokes real life terrors only to sweep them under the carpet . <p> * Which brings us to Jason , Unofficial Mayor of Hotshot . Crystal 's ex kidnaps her . Rather than chase after her , Crystal convinces Jason that his new lot in life is to protect the residents of Hotshot , clearly in need of baths , clothing , education and a toothbrush . Oh , we laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . Me ? I like this arc of Jason growing up before our eyes , from a boy who believes the world exists for him to a man who knows that heroism often means making room in your life for those who need a place in which to recover . High hopes for this story line . <p> * Unfortunately , I do n't have the same hopes for Sam . Tommy 's a thief and he ca n't read and he 's probably going to be a f -- up for most of his life . But the kid ai n't stupid . And Sam seems hell bent on punishing him for the wrong things . For the entire season , Tommy narrated perfectly the very thing that keeps others from going after what they want in life . Tommy have have more teeth than the folks in Hotshot , but he 's just as downtrodden . ( Let 's not forget , his parents pimped him out to dog fights . ) All to say , Sam , do n't shoot the kid ! That 's all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't read AND I 'm bleeding out ! You 're the worst brother ever ! " Or , was it one those really well-placed " warning " shots that landed smack dab in the bag of money , a symbol that money ca n't buy happiness , blah , blah , he ai n't heavy , he 's my brother , blah ? <p> * Finally , Lafayette , plagued by bloody images , evil ghosts and the terrorized inner monologues of his co-workers , learns that Jesus is a witch . But , hey , that 's cool ! Lafayette is the luckiest guy alive . His boyfriend is a witch and a dude ! What was that about ? Should n't Lafayette being freaking out ? " Aww , hells , no ! Get your witchy ass up on out of my kitchen ! " I ca n't say I have a good feeling about what comes next for Lafayette . Maybe if Holly had been in this episode to provide some balance ? Still , I 'm all in favour of anything that gives us more Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close Encounters vision off the top of the show . Is she a faerie or an alien ? <p> * Sookie 's giggle , the only thing that could have distracted me from Talbot 's remains going down the drain . Is this the darker side of Sookie ? A nod to the fact that faeries can be pushed too far ? Let 's hope so . <p> * In a way , Terry sticks out like a sore thumb on this show . But I love him , love him , love him . He reacts to joy the way most would react to sheer pain . He 's our touchstone , a reminder that just in case we want to empathize a little too closely with some of the characters , if you 've got a job , your health , and family and friends , well that 's a pretty damn good start . <p> * Hoyt and Jessica find a cute little bungalow with tidy hole for Jess to sleep in . Oh , but there 's a creepy doll in the next room , and Hoyt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how you create tension in a finale . Unfortunately , it did n't have to be these characters . Just the fact that they 're seemingly solid would have been finale enough for this die-hard romantic . ( Team Hoyt and Jessica ! ) <p> * Alcide 's debt is officially paid to Eric . Let 's get it on ! ( Yep . That 's all I want for Christmas . He can hump a tree , for all I care . Let 's get Alcide some acshun ! ) <p> * Nan Flanagan offers up another gem , that you do n't throw the baby out with the bath water . One bad vampire should not be a call to kill all vampires any more than one Osama Bin Laden should be a call to kill all humans . <p> * Jason and Andy 's difference in opinion of right and wrong . Just keep these two together . They work off each other so well . And if Andy goes down the red-bricked V road , Jason will know a thing or two about getting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's giggle . <p> Andy : You just rationalized away all need for law enforcement . Jason : I do n't know what that means exactly , but you 've got to stop those government people out there . <p> Sookie : I feel better protecting myself , now that I know I am basically vampire crack . <p> Russell : upon learning that he 'll likely be encased in cement for a long , long time 100 years ! That 's nothing to me . That 's a nap ! <p> Lafayette : to Jesus You 're a witch who 's a nurse who 's a dude . <p> Jason : Sometimes the right thing to do is the wrong thing . I know I did the right thing . <p> Sookie : to Russell Steppin ' around the fact that your word 's worth about as much as tits on a turtle ... <p> Eric : to Bill and Alcide Well , if you two have finished eye f -- ing each other , can we go ? <p> Hotshot resident : Here you go , Uncle Daddy Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of True Blood . I can criticize , but it 's only cause I loves ya !
