Canadian ethics crusader Duff Conacher is calling it quits as the head of Democracy Watch after 17 years of court challenges , research papers and pithy quotes for the media all in the name of making MPs , cabinet ministers and corporations more accountable .  A former Ralph Nader 's Raider who drew inspiration from the U.S. consumer advocate as an intern in the 1980s , Mr. Conacher has carved out a unique niche in Ottawa since he formed Democracy Watch in 1993 with seed money from the proceeds of a book he and Mr. Nader co-wrote .  No one else looks for loopholes and studies the details of federal ethics rules quite like he does , meaning that after Mr. Conacher departs from the national scene , Canadians could be in the dark as to which MPs , ministers or lobbyists may be running afoul of guidelines governing their conduct .  He will stay on for a few more months until he finds a replacement , but the challenge of raising money for the organization means there is no guarantee that it can years of very non-profit work , " said Mr. Conacher , 46 , a University of Toronto law school graduate . " Hopefully , if all goes well , it can continue . Then I 'll stay on the board and have someone else do what I 'm doing . "  Never associated with a political party , Mr. Conacher said he may one day run for office , but not any time soon . His grandfather Lionel was a two-term Liberal MP , NHL star and CFL Hall of Famer .  He has n't decided what he will do next , but said he simply felt it was time to do something else . Looking back , he said , changes to party donation rules , ethics and lobbying rules and banking regulations were the organization 's biggest accomplishments .  " Overall , we 've played a big part in winning more than 100 changes to federal law in the areas of government accountability and bank accountability , " he said .  Before Elections Canada began posting campaign donations online , Mr. Conacher 's group would Canada 's Ottawa head office , scanning corporate donations for signs of conflicts of interest .  Helped in part by the sponsorship scandal , Democracy Watch 's long-standing criticism of corporate donations eventually won out in Ottawa when prime minister Jean Chr ? tien imposed new limits in 2004 and Prime Minister Stephen Harper banned corporate and union donations entirely in 2006 .  Rejecting government funding , Mr. Conacher 's small operation is essentially a one man show operating out of a downtown Ottawa office that runs on volunteers and an annual budget of about $60,000 .  " There 's not too many people in civil society who are that selfless and work that tirelessly for no financial gain , " said NDP MP Pat Martin , who has often taken up many of the issues Mr. Conacher raised . " It 's a real loss and a real disappointment , but the guy deserves a medal . ... The guy did a great deal with very little and a very marginal little organization that punched way above its weight . "  Mr. Conacher was relentless in , Howard Wilson , repeatedly calling him a " lapdog " who lacked independence . Reached on Friday , Mr. Wilson said Mr. Conacher deserves credit for his indefatigable campaign for an independent ethics commissioner .  " He certainly was a force pushing the government to enshrine the position in legislation so that the person could not be removed except for cause , " Mr. Wilson recalled . " He was extraordinarily persistent . "
