C4 's debut at Nordstrom Pacific Centre features the company 's first-ever collaboration , the C4 X Susie Wall collection , which is designed by local style expert Susie Wall .  The line includes four reading styles : the Lucy , a vintage clubmaster ; the Lily , a baby-pink rounded frame ; the City , a contemporary update on the classic P3 ; and the Rockit , an edgy , tortoiseshell half-eye . Each pair is priced at $125 .  For every pair of frames sold , $5 will be donated to Cause We Care , a Vancouver-based charity that supports single mothers and children in need .  C4 joins a handful of other Canadian brands at Nordstrom Pacific Centre ( 799 Robson Street ) , including Mackage , Me to We , and Blush . The full C4 X Susie Wall collaboration also includes two pairs of shades , which are available online .
