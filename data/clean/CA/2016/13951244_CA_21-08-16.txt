muskrat based on false assumptions , but we 're committed : ball  premier dwight ball suggests he would not have sanctioned the muskrat falls project if he was in charge at the time .  ball says he was among the dissenting voices who raised serious concerns about the project years ago .  nalcor ceo stan marshall has called the project a " boondoggle " based on false assumptions . ball says the province now finds itself in a very difficult situation as a result . he says we 're 16 years behind initial power consumption forecasts , and that it 's fair to say the project was based on false assumptions , but we 're already committed with money spent and 70 per cent of the project completed .  the premier says we all know there is only one customer for the muskrat falls project ; the ratepayers of newfoundland and labrador , and he trusts that marshall and his team at nalcor can keep costs down as much as possible .
