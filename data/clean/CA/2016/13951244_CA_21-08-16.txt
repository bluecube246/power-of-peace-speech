Muskrat Based on False Assumptions , But We 're Committed : Ball  Premier Dwight Ball suggests he would not have sanctioned the Muskrat Falls project if he was in charge at the time .  Ball says he was among the dissenting voices who raised serious concerns about the project years ago .  Nalcor CEO Stan Marshall has called the project a " boondoggle " based on false assumptions . Ball says the province now finds itself in a very difficult situation as a result . He says we 're 16 years behind initial power consumption forecasts , and that it 's fair to say the project was based on false assumptions , but we 're already committed with money spent and 70 per cent of the project completed .  The Premier says we all know there is only one customer for the Muskrat Falls project ; the ratepayers of Newfoundland and Labrador , and he trusts that Marshall and his team at Nalcor can keep costs down as much as possible .
