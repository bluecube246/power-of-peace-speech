<h> Statement released by Music Africa , City of Toronto confirms event will once again run for two days . <p> Umurisho , a Burundian drum band , performed at Afrofest in Woodbine Park on Sunday in 2014 . The event has been running for decades but a recent decision to cut it back to a single day upset event organizers and fans . <p> After facing a cutback to a single day , Afrofest will again hold two days of concerts in Woodbine Park this year , according to a statement by the event 's organizers and the City of Toronto released on Wednesday evening . <p> The announcement comes after bickering between Music Africa -- the organization who puts on Toronto 's summer festival of traditional African music -- and the City of Toronto about noise violations and extended show times in previous years . Usually , the festival runs for two days in July -- but the city briefly clawed them back to one this year . <p> " Afrofest organizers acknowledge that there were some permit violations related to past years of the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end times , " read the statement signed by Councilor Mary-Margaret McMahon of Ward 32 , Music Africa president Peter Toh , and director Richard Ubbens of the city 's parks , forestry and recreation department . <p> Toh praised Councillor McMahon for her efforts in negotiating an agreement between Music Africa and the city . <p> " The councilor was very co-operative . She really understood our point of view , " said Toh in an interview with CP24 Wednesday evening . Toh did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Star . <p> It 's currently unclear whether the dispute has impacted Afrofest 's planning and scheduling this year , or what exactly the agreement between both sides constitutes . Toronto Music Advisory Council co-chair Andreas Kalogiannides , who sat in on Wednesday 's meeting , said that the agreement is going to be a return to the festival 's status quo . <p> " From where I was sitting , the agreement was just the two-day permit is going to be reinstated , and then Afrofest . . . is going to comply with the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a two-day schedule was one of the demands being made by Black Lives Matter-Toronto . The group has been encamped at Toronto Police headquarters for the past several days , mainly to demand action over the death of Andrew Loku at the hands of police officers in July 2015 . <p> Wednesday 's release goes on to say that the Toronto Music Advisory Council will be assisting Afrofest and other music events across the city . Kalogiannides said that he 'd spoken last week with Toh and offered to connect Afrofest with organizers with his organization . <p> " Peter ( Toh ) said they 'd be reaching out , because this is the kind of networking and capacity building that they 're looking to do on their own , " Kalogiannides said . <p> Perceived permit violations have been a recurring issue between Afrofest and the city . Back in 2011 , when Afrofest was still playing at Queen 's Park North , the fest was initially denied an event permit by the City of Toronto along with the Freedom Festival because of the size of their audiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that year .
