What is this ?  The BC Rod and Gun Show is supposed to open in Cloverdale in just over a month , but its permit from the City of Surrey has hit a snag .  " On Monday night , the security plan had yet to be reviewed by the RCMP , " Surrey Mayor Linda Hepner said . " It 's an application in progress . "  The show is supposed to open April 15 , but the seats could be empty if the permit is not approved . Show manager Steve Bednash declined an interview request from Global News , but told the Surrey newspaper he 's " flabbergasted . "  " We 'll jump through any hoop the city wants us to to put on a great show . "  But Hepner said " public safety is certainly a consideration . "  The problem seem to be handguns for sale at the show . Surrey has had its share of street handgun violence , and the show 's safety plan was only submitted to the RCMP on Monday council meeting .  But council seems supportive of the show if the safety plan is approved :  " I can tell you that this show , and as an outdoors man 's show , " Hepner says , " is generally an acceptable process , and last year had no difficulties .
