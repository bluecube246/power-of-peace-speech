what is this ?  the bc rod and gun show is supposed to open in cloverdale in just over a month , but its permit from the city of surrey has hit a snag .  " on monday night , the security plan had yet to be reviewed by the rcmp , " surrey mayor linda hepner said . " it 's an application in progress . "  the show is supposed to open april 15 , but the seats could be empty if the permit is not approved . show manager steve bednash declined an interview request from global news , but told the surrey newspaper he 's " flabbergasted . "  " we 'll jump through any hoop the city wants us to to put on a great show . "  but hepner said " public safety is certainly a consideration . "  the problem seem to be handguns for sale at the show . surrey has had its share of street handgun violence , and the show 's safety plan was only submitted to the rcmp on monday council meeting .  but council seems supportive of the show if the safety plan is approved :  " i can tell you that this show , and as an outdoors man 's show , " hepner says , " is generally an acceptable process , and last year had no difficulties .
