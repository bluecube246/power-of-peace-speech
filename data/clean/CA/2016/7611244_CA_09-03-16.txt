<h> What is this ? <p> The BC Rod and Gun Show is supposed to open in Cloverdale in just over a month , but its permit from the City of Surrey has hit a snag . <p> " On Monday night , the security plan had yet to be reviewed by the RCMP , " Surrey Mayor Linda Hepner said . " It 's an application in progress . " <p> The show is supposed to open April 15 , but the seats could be empty if the permit is not approved . Show manager Steve Bednash declined an interview request from Global News , but told the Surrey newspaper he 's " flabbergasted . " <p> " We 'll jump through any hoop the city wants us to to put on a great show . " <p> But Hepner said " public safety is certainly a consideration . " <p> The problem seem to be handguns for sale at the show . Surrey has had its share of street handgun violence , and the show 's safety plan was only submitted to the RCMP on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council meeting . <p> But council seems supportive of the show if the safety plan is approved : <p> " I can tell you that this show , and as an outdoors man 's show , " Hepner says , " is generally an acceptable process , and last year had no difficulties .
