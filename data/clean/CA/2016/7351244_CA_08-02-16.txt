<p> Mi'kmaq leader John Joe Sark is shown in a handout photo . He has written to the federal government asking that the name of the Port-la-Joye - Fort Amherst national historic site near Charlottetown , P.E.I. , be changed . Sark says the name honours General Jeffery Amherst , a British military commander in the 1700s who supported using blankets infected with small pox to kill aboriginal people . THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO <p> CHARLOTTETOWN -- It 's a " grave insult " that a national park in Prince Edward Island still bears the name of a military general who wanted to kill aboriginal people with smallpox , says a Mi'kmaq leader . <p> John Joe Sark , a member of the Mi'kmaq Nation traditional government , says the name of 18th-century British military commander Jeffery Amherst should be removed from the Port-la-Joye -- Fort Amherst historic site near Charlottetown . <p> " Why should they name any public place after a barbarian and a tyrant that this guy was ? " Sark said Monday from Johnstons River , P.E.I. <p> " He may be a hero to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's no hero to the Mi'kmaq people . " <p> He has written to the federal government in a bid that adds fuel to an ongoing debate about how historic figures are honoured across Canada and the United States . <p> In a letter dated Jan. 29 to Environment Minister Catherine McKenna , Sark makes his case for changing the park 's name to reflect how Mi'kmaq lived in the region long before and ever since European settlers . <p> " His name is a grave insult to the Mi'kmaq people of Prince Edward Island , the Atlantic region and to the rest of the aboriginal people in Canada , " it says . " General Jeffery Amherst 's ultimate goal was to exterminate the Mi'kmaq and other aboriginal peoples of North America . " <p> Sark said he has so far received no answer from McKenna 's office . He was part of a similar campaign in 2008 to urge the former federal Conservative government to change the name . Parks Canada officials at the time declined , saying they wanted a " balanced history , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-write history , but we want to write the true history . What you read in ... books is not everything . They leave out all this stuff of how cruel and how barbaric these guys were . " <p> An emailed statement from McKenna 's office said the minister was aware of Sark 's letter and would review the request . <p> An emailed statement from Parks Canada said the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada , an advisory body to Parks Canada , considered a request to remove Amherst 's name from the park in July 2009 and ultimately recommended against it . <p> However , the statement said Parks Canada staff have continued to " engage with the Mi'kmaq Confederacy of P.E.I. and the Mi'kmaq community for interpretation and special events at the site . " <p> " Parks Canada is committed to working respectfully with First Nations and honouring their contributions to Canada 's protected places , " reads the statement . <p> " The HSMBC would review and give their recommendation on any new proposals to change the name of Port-la-Joye / Fort Amherst National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer who rose up the ranks of the British Army in the mid-1700s , is considered a key engineer of British victories in the Seven Years ' War for control of New France territories in North America . Several places in the U.S. and Canada , such as Amherstburg , Ont. , bear his name . <p> Amherst College in Massachusetts said last month the British military commander would no longer appear in school communications or as an unofficial mascot . Lord Jeff -- as he was known around campus -- was increasingly seen as an oppressive figure who supported using blankets infected with smallpox to kill aboriginal people . <p> That announcement followed a flare-up in Nova Scotia in December over a statue of Edward Cornwallis in a Halifax park . A plaque notes that Cornwallis founded the city in the 1700s but fails to mention a scalping proclamation he offered against the Mi'kmaq . It promised " a reward of ten Guineas for every Indian Micmac taken or killed , to be paid upon producing such Savage taken or his scalp . " <p> Some historians caution against vilifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more diverse depictions , especially in public spaces . <p> Notice : Your email may not yet have been verified .
