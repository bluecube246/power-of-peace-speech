mi'kmaq leader john joe sark is shown in a handout photo . he has written to the federal government asking that the name of the port-la-joye - fort amherst national historic site near charlottetown , p.e.i. , be changed . sark says the name honours general jeffery amherst , a british military commander in the 1700s who supported using blankets infected with small pox to kill aboriginal people . the canadian press/ho  charlottetown -- it 's a " grave insult " that a national park in prince edward island still bears the name of a military general who wanted to kill aboriginal people with smallpox , says a mi'kmaq leader .  john joe sark , a member of the mi'kmaq nation traditional government , says the name of 18th-century british military commander jeffery amherst should be removed from the port-la-joye -- fort amherst historic site near charlottetown .  " why should they name any public place after a barbarian and a tyrant that this guy was ? " sark said monday from johnstons river , p.e.i.  " he may be a hero to , but he 's no hero to the mi'kmaq people . "  he has written to the federal government in a bid that adds fuel to an ongoing debate about how historic figures are honoured across canada and the united states .  in a letter dated jan. 29 to environment minister catherine mckenna , sark makes his case for changing the park 's name to reflect how mi'kmaq lived in the region long before and ever since european settlers .  " his name is a grave insult to the mi'kmaq people of prince edward island , the atlantic region and to the rest of the aboriginal people in canada , " it says . " general jeffery amherst 's ultimate goal was to exterminate the mi'kmaq and other aboriginal peoples of north america . "  sark said he has so far received no answer from mckenna 's office . he was part of a similar campaign in 2008 to urge the former federal conservative government to change the name . parks canada officials at the time declined , saying they wanted a " balanced history , " re-write history , but we want to write the true history . what you read in ... books is not everything . they leave out all this stuff of how cruel and how barbaric these guys were . "  an emailed statement from mckenna 's office said the minister was aware of sark 's letter and would review the request .  an emailed statement from parks canada said the historic sites and monuments board of canada , an advisory body to parks canada , considered a request to remove amherst 's name from the park in july 2009 and ultimately recommended against it .  however , the statement said parks canada staff have continued to " engage with the mi'kmaq confederacy of p.e.i. and the mi'kmaq community for interpretation and special events at the site . "  " parks canada is committed to working respectfully with first nations and honouring their contributions to canada 's protected places , " reads the statement .  " the hsmbc would review and give their recommendation on any new proposals to change the name of port-la-joye / fort amherst national officer who rose up the ranks of the british army in the mid-1700s , is considered a key engineer of british victories in the seven years ' war for control of new france territories in north america . several places in the u.s. and canada , such as amherstburg , ont. , bear his name .  amherst college in massachusetts said last month the british military commander would no longer appear in school communications or as an unofficial mascot . lord jeff -- as he was known around campus -- was increasingly seen as an oppressive figure who supported using blankets infected with smallpox to kill aboriginal people .  that announcement followed a flare-up in nova scotia in december over a statue of edward cornwallis in a halifax park . a plaque notes that cornwallis founded the city in the 1700s but fails to mention a scalping proclamation he offered against the mi'kmaq . it promised " a reward of ten guineas for every indian micmac taken or killed , to be paid upon producing such savage taken or his scalp . "  some historians caution against vilifying more diverse depictions , especially in public spaces .  notice : your email may not yet have been verified . please check your email , click the link to verify your address , and then submit your comment . if you ca n't find this email , access your profile editor to re-send the confirmation email . you must have a verified email to submit a comment . once you have done so , check again .  almost done !  please confirm the information below before signing up .  * #socialregistrationform * * **27;59;toolong * * **26;88;toolong * * **30;116;toolong * * **29;148;toolong * by clicking " create account " , i confirm that i have read and understood each of the website terms of service and privacy policy and that i agree to be bound by them .  sign in to complete account merge  almost done !  please confirm the information below before signing up .  * #registrationform * * **32;179;toolong * * **31;213;toolong * * **35;246;toolong * * **34;283;toolong * * **31;319;toolong * * **38;352;toolong * by clicking " create account each of the website terms of service and privacy policy and that i agree to be bound by them .
