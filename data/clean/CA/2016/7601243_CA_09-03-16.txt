<h> Refugee wrestling his way onto first-of-its-kind Olympic team <h> Congo 's Popole Misenga could be the first member of Team Refugee <p> Popole Misenga fled war in the DRC and is hoping to compete under the Olympic flag ( Kim Brunhuber/CBC ) <p> Kim BrunhuberLos Angeles correspondent <p> Kim Brunhuber is a CBC News Senior Reporter based in Los Angeles . He has traveled the world from Sierra Leone to Afghanistan as a videojournalist , shooting and editing pieces for TV , radio and online . Originally from Montreal , he speaks French and Spanish , and is also a published novelist . <h> Related Stories <p> When Popole Misenga started training at the Instituto Reacao judo club on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro , his opponents knew there was something different about him . <p> Of course , Misenga -- about 5-9 " , 185 pounds , hair in short dreads -- was from Africa and did n't speak Portuguese . But it was more than that . It was the way he competed , they said , even in practice . As though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosening up before evening practice , speaking in broken French , his second language . <p> " I come from a province in the Congo , Bukavu , I was fleeing war , " says Misenga . " There in my country , things are bad . I did n't have any family . " <p> His mother was killed and his brother disappeared during the five-year war in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and its aftermath . To escape the fighting , he put everything he had into a different kind of combat : judo . He discovered he was good . <p> Coach Geraldo Bernardes says training against Brazilian Olympians will help Misenga realize his dream of making the team . ( Kim Brunhuber/CBC ) <p> " I won the championship in Kinshasa , I was the champion of the Congo , " Misenga says . " If I represent my country , I win nothing ... $300 . A champion 's worth $300 . " <p> Then , in 2013 , he was invited to compete in the world championships in Rio . That 's when Misenga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going back . <p> Three times a week , he embarks on a two-hour commute to training from the Rio slum he now calls home . <p> While Misenga grapples with one opponent after another , his coach Geraldo Bernardes prowls the mat with a long stick in one hand . Every so often he prods Misenga , shouting instructions . <p> Over the last two years , more often than not , Misenga has been holding his own against tough Brazilian opponents . So , Bernardes thought : maybe Misenga had a shot , if not at a medal , than at least qualifying . <p> Misenga , about to defeat an opponent , his third of the evening 's practice . ( Kim Brunhuber/CBC ) <p> " He 's training with athletes who will probably compete in the Olympic Games , " Bernardes says , " so I think that he will have a good performance in the Olympics . " <p> The question was : For whom would he compete ? He was n't eligible to represent Brazil . And he was n't willing to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in Olympic history , he 'd have a third choice . <p> Recently IOC president Thomas Bach announced the details of a new squad , Team Refugee Olympic Athletes . Its members will compete under the IOC flag . A handful of athletes have already done that in previous years -- athletes whose countries had ceased to exist or had n't yet been officially born . But for refugees , it will be a first . <p> The IOC has identified 43 potential refugee athletes . Over the next couple of months , it will formally invite those who qualify to be part of the team , which will likely be composed of five to 10 athletes . Misenga is widely expected to be the first . <p> " I am proud , very proud . I will be the first refugee in the Olympic Games . If it works out , " Misenga says . <p> His coach says he believes in him , and tonight Bernardes sees plenty of reasons why : Misenga throws his first opponent , then performs an arm bar on his second , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gym ; several are already world medallists . But his hunger , he says , is a weapon . He knows what making the team would mean . <p> " It sends a loud message to the world . ... If you 're a refugee , " he says , " you can keep hope in your heart . "
