<p> A closed-door council meeting that reversed the city 's position on keeping retail space in a downtown municipal parking garage was an affront to democracy , the head of the business association charged Tuesday . <p> " I am very upset , concerned and disappointed about what occurred in a very secretive meeting with council , " said Larry Horwitz , chair of the Downtown Windsor Business Improvement Association . " We have to see what can be done from here . " <p> Council voted in-camera Monday to spend about $500,000 to turn the main floor of the city-owned Pelissier Street Parking Garage -- which currently offers largely empty retail office space -- into 51 more parking spots . <p> Horwitz is organizing an emergency meeting next week of the DWBIA board , which has long called for more retail outlets in the garage to boost the street 's vibrancy . <p> Horwitz said a majority of council agreed to seek retail tenants , only to have the decision reversed in a closed-door meeting . He understands that councillors could not discuss a private proposal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to parking should have been made with stakeholders ' input . <p> " You do n't turn a main street into a hollow dead zone , " Horwitz said . " It will hurt merchants , residents and the city . No urban planner would ever advise it . An empty dead zone parking lot does not lure people downtown . It hurts business and creates an unsafe space . " <p> Only three of eight retail spaces are filled in the garage at the moment , Windsor Pride Community , Youssef Hair Boutique , and Canada South Festival Network . They will have six months to find new locations . <p> " We have worked for years to see if it 's feasible to keep tenants in the main floor of the Pelissier Street Parking Garage , " Mayor Drew Dilkens said after Monday 's council meeting . " Council tried over many year to solicit that space , market it with a realtor , put signs up in the windows , and just do a whole host of things you would expect in order to turn that into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for expressions of interest . But Dilkens said in the end the city received only one proposal , which did n't meet council 's minimum standards . <p> " We 've come to the end of the road , " Dilkens said . " And the decision was based on the fact that the university is downtown , the Armouries will be opening in the next year , so there will be a need for additional parking spaces . The demand in that garage is very , very high . " <p> Council put $480,000 aside to renovate the space if a serious tenant came forward . <p> But Horwitz said the main hurdle to attracting tenants is the dismal condition of the space , which has water damage and mould , among other issues . <p> " You ca n't get a tenant if you do n't renovate it , " said Horwitz , who thinks the city did n't truly try to market it . " You ca n't even show it if you have mould . " <p> Background and costs <p> City engineers have estimated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space overhaul would cost $1.8 million . The garage , built in 1979 and owned by the city since 2003 , originally offered only parking . It currently has 349 parking spaces . An earlier administration report says that if all spots were continually rented out , and monthly rates rose from $60 to $70 , it would make $293,000 a year . Instead , the city lost more than $150,000 in 2013 . <h> Comments <p> We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts .
