the college of physicians and surgeons of saskatchewan has added naloxone and buprenorphine to its methadone treatment guidelines .  it 's a recognition of alternate drugs that are used to cope with opioid dependency , associate registrar bryan salte said .  the college introduced a new , more thorough 102-page set of guidelines last year based on alberta 's model . the guidelines help physicians who prescribe methadone -- and now the new drugs -- to patients with opioid addictions .  they spell out how to write prescriptions , assess potential patients , and determine proper dosage as well as when to let patients take doses home and when to halt treatment .  in january , the college also approved the doctors ' ability to prescribe naloxone -- a drug that can reverse the effects of an opiate overdose for long enough to obtain medical help -- to family and friends of patients with opiate addictions . the policy is meant to reflect the fact that a person suffering an overdose is unable to self-administer the drug .  comments  we encourage blog posts . we are committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion , so we ask you to avoid personal attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful . if you encounter a comment that is abusive , click the " x " in the upper right corner of the comment box to report spam or abuse . we are using facebook commenting . visit our faq page for more information .
