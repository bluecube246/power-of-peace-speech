<p> The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan has added naloxone and buprenorphine to its methadone treatment guidelines . <p> It 's a recognition of alternate drugs that are used to cope with opioid dependency , associate registrar Bryan Salte said . <p> The college introduced a new , more thorough 102-page set of guidelines last year based on Alberta 's model . The guidelines help physicians who prescribe methadone -- and now the new drugs -- to patients with opioid addictions . <p> They spell out how to write prescriptions , assess potential patients , and determine proper dosage as well as when to let patients take doses home and when to halt treatment . <p> In January , the College also approved the doctors ' ability to prescribe naloxone -- a drug that can reverse the effects of an opiate overdose for long enough to obtain medical help -- to family and friends of patients with opiate addictions . The policy is meant to reflect the fact that a person suffering an overdose is unable to self-administer the drug . <h> Comments <p> We encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog posts .
