SHERI LAMB/Daily Miner and News <p> More accustomed to shining a light on his students , Dave Tresoor found himself in the spotlight during the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations ' banquet for the Girls ' AA ' Volleyball championship on Sunday . <p> Tresoor was awarded the OFSAA Leadership in School Sport Award for his dedication and commitment to combining athletics with academics at Beaver Brae Secondary School . <p> " It 's humbling . Volunteers do n't expect any recognition so it came as a great surprise , " said Tresoor about receiving the award March 6 . " It 's something that 's very much appreciated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kids . That 's our ultimate goal . " <p> Tresoor began his teaching and coaching career in Red Lake in 1990 where he taught for nine years , while also coaching hockey , soccer , volleyball and badminton . When the Keewatin-Patricia District School Board was created in 1999 , Tresoor moved to Kenora to teach at Beaver Brae . <p> Prior to embarking on his teaching career , Tresoor played for the St. James Canadians in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League and through his experience was awarded a scholarship to Brandon University where he played hockey and received his teaching degree . He said he decided to pursue teaching as a career because he remembered having a lot of teachers who encouraged and mentored him during his school days and he wanted to give back . <p> Tresoor said combining athletics with academics helps build stronger bonds with the students . <p> " It 's to have an opportunity to build a relationship with the kids . Those relationships you build when you 're a coach carry over to the classroom and it just creates a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you outside the classroom , " said Tresoor . " I was very fortunate over my career when I was growing up to have a number of great coaches and mentors . " <p> In addition to teaching and coaching various school sports , Tresoor initiated the creation of the Hockey Academy program in 2012 which has moved beyond Beaver Brae and Kenora to encompass many Keewatin-Patricia District schools and is still growing . Tresoor was in Red Lake last week to help the school get an academy up and running . <p> " It was my ultimate goal to get the students of Keewatin-Patricia , at least for the students in Kenora , to be able to participate . I never thought we would be able to take it board wide , " said Tresoor . " We just continue to expand and to give as many kids the opportunity that we can . " <p> He will also step into a new role at Beaver Brae starting March 21 when he assumes the duties of vice principal . <p> Tresoor said the worlds of teacher and coach are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids reach a goal . <p> " I 've been fortunate enough to a part of a number of great teams , both as a player and a coach , where maybe we went in as the underdog and were able to achieve more than we were expected to . We believed in each other , " said Tresoor . " I guess when it comes to teaching as well it 's kind of the same when you have an opportunity to work with a group of kids and nurse them along and get them to the point where they 're able to graduate and prepare them to go after high school . It 's just so nice to see when you get a group of kids together that achieve something that they 've always wanted . It 's pretty rewarding . " <p> In November 2015 , Beaver Brae athletic director Reg McDonald received the OFSAA Leadership in School Sport Award .
