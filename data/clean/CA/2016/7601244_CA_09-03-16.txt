<p> Following in the footsteps of some of its Silicon Valley neighbours , social-media marketing provider Buffer Inc. eliminated employee vacation caps in 2014 , but quickly discovered that the policy was having the opposite of its intended effect . <p> " We thought it sounded cool , so we kind of adopted that more or less without looking at it through a critical lens , " said Leo Widrich , the company 's chief executive officer and co-founder . " The following two years , we found that people on the whole were taking very little vacation time . " <h> Jeff Booth <h> BALANCE <p> Only nine of Buffer 's 25 employees travelled in 2014 , and Mr. Widrich grew concerned that it was having a negative impact on the company . In hindsight , he attributes the policy 's failure in part to the military-like camaraderie of the startup world , where taking time off can feel like leaving your fellow soldiers behind on the battlefield . Furthermore , Mr. Widrich suggests that his employees may have felt uncomfortable taking time when he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding the company three years before . <p> It became so uncommon to travel that , in 2015 , Buffer began offering bonuses to staff just for going on vacation : $1,000 for themselves and another $500 for each of their travel companions . Since then , 33 of the company 's 35 employees have claimed their bonuses . <p> While the concept of " paid-paid vacation " may seem foreign in Canada , some U.S. firms -- such as Evernote and FullContact -- began paying staff to unwind after concluding that " unlimited vacation " unintentionally equated to " no vacation . " <p> As Canadian employers begin to implement their own unlimited-vacation policies , however , they have the advantage of learning from the pitfalls experienced south of the border . Many are now introducing such policies with suggested or mandatory minimum requirements , allowing staff to take time to unwind without any of the guilt . <p> " We 've had a chance to see their mistakes , " said Fraser Stark , the vice-president of talent for Influitive Corp. , a Toronto-based marketing software provider with 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around what is reasonable behaviour , and we 've solved that in a number of ways : One is demonstrating at the senior leadership level what appropriate behaviour is ; another is having tongue-in-cheek ' minimum ' levels of vacation . " <p> While some might view an unlimited vacation policy as a competitive recruiting tactic , Mr. Stark says that Influitive had a different goal in mind . He explains that the company 's decision to eliminate caps on vacation time is representative of its corporate culture . <p> " We do n't measure what time people get in or leave at the start or end of the day , it 's not a punch-clock culture , and likewise , we do n't measure how many days per year people work , " he said . " It can be a great test to see who is dedicated to the company . If you put this approach to vacation in place and someone books an eight-week Caribbean vacation , you 've learned something about how much they care about the company and achieving results . " <p> Furthermore , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , Mr. Stark says it also forces the company to learn how to operate without them . " Any employee could get poached away or run into a medical problem , so you 're better off using your vacation policy as a way to test coping with an employee 's absence before it happens , " he said . <p> Kurtis McBride , the chief executive officer and co-founder of Kitchener-based Miovision Technologies Inc. -- which provides traffic-management technology solutions for municipal governments -- believes that the days of formal vacation allowances may be coming to an end . While the company has informally upheld an unlimited-vacation policy since its launch more than 10 years ago , it was only made official last month , and incorporated a mandatory minimum . <p> " I 'd like to think there 's a revolution under way right now , where employers are starting to treat their employees like people , trusting them to come in and give it their all and do their best work , " he said . " Employers across the country are starting to trust their employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might abuse the policy but the 99 per cent that are coming in with the best of intentions . " <p> Jeff Booth , the CEO and co-founder of Vancouver-based BuildDirect.com Technologies Inc. , agrees that unlimited vacation is just one symptom of a larger revolution taking shape in workplaces across Canada . " When you design systems to prevent abuse for the worst people , you 're actually hurting the best people , " he said , adding that his company 's unlimited-vacation policy , which went into effect at the beginning of the year , included a mandatory minimum as well . " When you trust people , they tend to trust you right back . " <p> While many of the workplace trends that originate in Silicon Valley eventually make their way north , the trend of paid-paid vacation may not become necessary , thanks to the guidelines Canadian employers are putting in place . <p> " If it was baked in from the start , I think we would have saved some time and money , " Mr. Widrich said , speculating on how things might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Buffer 's original unlimited vacation policy . " People probably would n't need the financial incentive to go on vacation . " <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .
