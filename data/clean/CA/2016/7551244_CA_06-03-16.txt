brick by brick , trevor parkins-sciberras is building an appreciation for toronto 's transit system .  lego brick , that is .  the 24-year-old freelance video editor is constructing lego models depicting the evolution of toronto 's transit , from the horse-drawn streetcars that ran on rails in the unpaved streets of " muddy york , " to the new bombardier fleet rolling out today .  when he knew he wanted to build his own mini streetcars and buses after a trip to a milton railway museum , picking a medium was easy .  " i would n't really know how else to make a model of these vehicles . lego 's kind of my thing , " he said .  when it could n't be found in his bins , he ordered custom pieces online .  not the first transit fan to convert piles of red lego bricks into " red rocket " models , he found plans for the clrv streetcars , which still dominate the fleet , online .  ttc spokesperson brad ross thinks the models are torontonians in so many positive ways . the pride in the ttc and how that manifests itself always delights us , " ross said in an email .  ultimately , parkins-sciberras would like to see the models trotted out for special events , like doors open toronto , at the toronto railway museum .  he hopes the models and his other transit projects , including a video series , spur an interest and appreciation for the ttc and " make more people enthusiasts rather than whining because their bus was delayed by five minutes , " he said .  " i like to tell people that they should be thankful the streetcars are n't still pulled by horses . "  toronto railway company " open car , " converted from a former horse-drawn car . ( this replica using original parts from an 1892 model was built for toronto 's centennial in 1934 . )  parkins-sciberras says he did n't draw formal plans . " it was mostly by looking at the old photos . you study the design of the streetcar and just translate it "  introduced in 1938 , the president 's conference committee cars came to be affectionately known as the " red rockets . "  " i 've spent my whole life either taking the ttc or riding a bike , so i 'm not too fond of cars , " said parkins-sciberras . " i think cars hog a lot of space on the roads , and that the ttc is much more environmentally friendly . "  the clrvs , and their articulated versions , are in the process of being retired after more than 30 years of service in the ttc fleet .  construction of the clrv model took six straight hours , most of that spent digging through bins .  since he started the project , parkins-sciberras has tapped into the large community of transit enthusiasts . though many share photographs and history , he thought there was room for more original content .  parkins-sciberras ' model of the ttc 's newest streetcar , the flexity , used about 700 pieces . models of the older , blockier versions have closer to 200 pieces @
