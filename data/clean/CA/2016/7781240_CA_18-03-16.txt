<p> For Peter MacKay , the next Conservative Party leader does n't necessarily need to be a political outsider . <p> But he or she has to be a " very substantive and serious " person who brings life experience and thoughtful policies to the party , says the former cabinet minister , who is leaving the door open to running himself . <p> " It looks better to have that kind of heft , as opposed to reality-TV , Kardashian-style of politics , " Mr. MacKay said in an interview with The Globe and Mail . <p> And is a " substantive " person in direct contrast to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ? <p> " People will have to come to their own conclusions about that , " he said . <p> The federal Conservatives are set to pick their new leader in May , 2017 , as part of the fallout from their election loss in October and Stephen Harper 's resignation . <p> The Nova Scotia-born Mr. MacKay , who did n't run in the last election , is seen as a popular choice among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-runner in leadership polls . <p> Although no formal announcements have been made , other potential leadership contenders include Conservative MPs Kellie Leitch , Jason Kenney and Maxime Bernier , and even Kevin O'Leary of TV 's Shark Tank -- although the latter also said he 'd consider a run for the Liberals . <p> Now a partner in the Toronto office of U.S.-based global law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie , Mr. MacKay takes the subway to work and says he is " quite happy " with his new life outside of politics , focusing more on his young family with wife Nazanin Afshin-Jam . <p> " But am I pining away , thinking about it and organizing and getting an apparatus in place ? Uh , no . I 've done that before , " he said , referring to his run for the Progressive Conservative leadership in 2003 before it merged with Mr. Harper 's Canadian Alliance to form the modern Conservative Party of Canada . <p> " It 's a tremendous commitment . " <p> These days , Mr. MacKay refers to himself as another type of PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he does n't just say no to a leadership run , Mr. MacKay answered : " I 'm still interested and engaged in a lot of issues that I care about , and politics is a vehicle to bring about change . It sounds trite , but it 's true . " <p> Although he has n't been to Ottawa since the election , Mr. MacKay has been following politics . He says he is concerned with the swift changes Mr. Trudeau 's government is making . <p> He accused the Liberals of " spending a disproportionate amount of time undoing the things that we did . " <p> He mentioned Liberal pledges such as the return of the long-form census , rolling back Old Age Security eligibility to 65 , reviewing the temporary foreign workers program and changing Canada 's child benefit payments . <p> He pointed to the Canadian Forces ' 10-year involvement in Afghanistan as an accomplishment under the Conservative government that is now being pushed aside by Mr. Trudeau . Canada was not absent on the world stage during the Conservative rule , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of statement . It suggests somehow that only Liberals are Canadian , " Mr. MacKay said . <p> " It comes across very much as , ' We 're entitled . We 're supposed to be the governing party . ' " <p> But Mr. MacKay acknowledges that Mr. Trudeau 's " positive message " resonated during the election campaign -- and has been taken up by Conservative Interim Leader Rona Ambrose . <p> " She 's hit the right note on a lot of the issues , " he said . <p> During his 18 years in office , Mr. MacKay served as minister of foreign affairs , defence and justice . It was a career that came with its share of controversies , both personal and professional : He faced intense criticism for taking a military helicopter from a private fishing trip in Newfoundland to a news conference on the government 's dime ; he also had a failed public romance with former Conservative MP and floor-crosser Belinda Stronach . <p> He also repeatedly made the political Hill Times newspaper 's list of " sexiest male MPs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's sort of like being picked best-looking in a leper colony , " he said , dryly . <p> In his last post as justice minister , Mr. MacKay , a former Crown prosecutor who speaks often on the rights of victims , publicly clashed with the judiciary on a number of occasions . <p> Mr. MacKay said some judges " castigated " Conservative laws , including a refusal to implement the mandatory victims surcharge , a fine for offenders . <p> " We still have judges that are bristling -- those filthy , democratically elected people telling us what to do . It 's rather shocking when you think about it , " Mr. MacKay said . <p> " I 'm startled that there was such push-back . " <p> But he denies being behind some of the more contentious Conservative laws , such as a ban on face coverings at citizenship ceremonies . " I was n't the engineer , let 's say , of things like niqab legislation , " he said . <h> Topics : <h> Next story <h> Learn More <h> Discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have come across .
