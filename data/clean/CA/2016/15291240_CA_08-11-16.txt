council voted tuesday to support a new $30 per year levy on edmonton taxpayers to fix back alleys .  the levy would increase over several years to $30 annually for the typical single-family home over a couple years , with construction starting on the worst back alleys in 2019 . it would apply to everyone , whether or not they have a back alley .  by 2022 , construction crews would be rebuilding 49 kilometres of back alleys a year .  councillors michael oshry and mike nickel voted against the plan , with nickel arguing to fund alley renewal out of the existing infrastructure budget . that would push innovation , he argued , suggesting if edmonton switches to street-front garbage pickup it would n't have to rebuild back alleys to standard that can handle heavy truck traffic .  the plan still needs approval during the spring supplementary capital budget adjustment . it will compete with other priorities there , mayor don iveson said . but " clearly council has identified today it is something we will prioritize . "  edmonton has paid for by residents through local improvement taxes . but in some areas , two thirds are ranked in poor to very poor condition , filled with potholes and draining poorly .  coun. scott mckeen said he got a standing ovation at a community meeting recently when he said the city was going to renew alleys . " people , when they know exactly what their dollars are going to , are a little less reticent to pay , " he said .  " i like the idea of the alleys being done but i 'll be interested ( to see what happens ) when it comes forward to budget , " said coun. bev esslinger .  council voted to compensate residents still paying local improvement levies for their back alleys by reducing their property taxes . there will be no compensation for those who already paid the bill . business still paying their levies will not be compensated .  comments  we encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts . we are committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful . if you encounter a comment that is abusive , click the " x " in the upper right corner of the comment box to report spam or abuse . we are using facebook commenting . visit our faq page for more information .
