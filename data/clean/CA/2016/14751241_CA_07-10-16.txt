iain macintyre : forced out as a player , malhotra eased in as coach  manny malhotra was a proud player with the vancouver canucks and hopes to bring that same passion to coaching , having been named a player development coach with the nhl squad.jonathan hayward / the canadian press  when the vancouver canucks announced a month ago that manny malhotra was joining them as a player development coach , the surprise was not the name of the player but the name of the team .  the canucks are the national hockey league organization that tried to force malhotra into retirement 3 ? years ago when former general manager mike gillis told the centre he was being shut down for his own safety , two seasons after a gruesome injury nearly cost malhotra his left eye .  malhotra and his wife joann wept that day when gillis told them in a coffee bar on south granville that manny could n't play anymore . that sadness was replaced at times by anger as malhotra defiantly resumed his career after his contract with the canucks the carolina hurricanes and montreal canadiens and , last year , for the lake erie monsters .  malhotra never played as well as before he was struck by a deflected puck against the colorado avalanche on march 16 , 2011 , when he was considered one of the best checking centres in the game . but he refused to be told when his career was over , just as he refused to be defined by his eye injury .  he hated talking about it and , to this day , has not said how much of the vision -- maybe all of it -- he lost in his left eye that night .  he was a hockey player . period .  and now suddenly he is a hockey coach .  and for everyone who knew him as a player , articulate and studious and fiercely devoted to the details of his craft , a natural leader , this hard right turn into coaching makes perfect sense . this was always going to be the next move when malhotra was finished playing .  but no one canucks .  " no , not at that point , just the way things did end here , " malhotra , 36 , conceded this week after a canuck practice . " it was n't on a great note . my mindset was that i was still a player . i was healthy , i felt good , i still wanted to play . a lot of people were asking me if i was going to get into coaching or get into broadcasting .  " but in my mind , i never made that transition ; i was going to play . i was n't trying to prove anybody wrong . i was trying to continue what i wanted to do and pursue what i felt i could do . it was gratifying in the sense that i proved the people who believed in me right . "  malhotra bears no malice toward gillis or , obviously , the canuck organization . he always believed his former boss truly felt he was acting in the player 's best interest , trying to protect him from harm that might  still , malhotra said this week that the day he was told he could n't play was " hands-down " worse than the night he was hurt .  " you ca n't wrap your head around it , " he said . " with anything , anything you love to do and have been doing for a long time , when someone comes along and tells you you ca n't do it anymore , it 's a hard pill to swallow . that was definitely the hardest thing i ever had to go through as a player . i 've gone through a lot of injuries and there 's that self-doubt all the time . but when somebody takes something away from you , it hurts . "  gillis said back then that shutting down malhotra was " the hardest thing i have done in this job . " it came nine games into the lockout-shortened season -- nine games after malhotra 's visit to nike 's sports science complex in oregon confirmed for the canucks a significant level of vision impairment .  contacted at his home to medical confidentiality and declined to be interviewed . stung by criticism -- some justified , some unwarranted -- since he was fired as canuck president and gm on april 8 , 2014 after the most successful and profitable six-year run in franchise history , gillis does n't do interviews anymore .  he did say , however , he has tremendous respect for malhotra and always believed he would make a good coach . gillis said he told malhotra so when they spoke in the summer .  malhotra was recruited by canuck president trevor linden in a series of phone calls . malhotra and his wife , the sister of canadian basketball icon steve nash , always kept their home in vancouver and wanted to raise their children here . their kids are 8 , 6 and 3 and joann is expecting a fourth in december .  raised in the toronto area , malhotra calls himself " an adopted west coaster . "  after playing 991 nhl games for seven teams , he has plenty to offer the canucks . he is mentoring 21-year-old centre bo horvat awful record on faceoffs .  " i really liked trying to understand the game , " malhotra said . " that 's the kind of player i was -- i had to think the game . a lot of guys out there , it 's natural ability . they 're just gifted , and it happens for them .  " for me , my career started to take off when i was playing for ken hitchcock in columbus ( 2005-09 ) and i started understanding the game . more than just the details , there was the understanding of why you do something . it was a turning point in my career . "  the canucks were not an easy sell to him mainly because malhotra still wanted to play somewhere this season . he has n't filed retirement papers with the nhl and " i still do n't use the r-word .  " i do n't think that feeling of wanting to play ever goes away , " he said . " even talking to steamer ( canuck senior adviser stan smyl ) , he still you . it 's why people stay in the game , why people coach . it 's being at the rink and being part of a team , part of something .
