But the Uber-ization of ground transportation has made many uneasy about the future of jobs -- and the prospect of disrupting the traditional view of employment . Will we all have Uber-style jobs one day ?  The Toronto Sun spoke with John-Kurt Pliniussen , a Queen 's University professor and business expert , about the growing sharing economy and where Uber is headed :  *Will Uber stop ?  " It wo n't stop . What will happen is they will continue to experiment with all the inconvenience aspects of transportation . As long as there 's innovation and there are holes that are based on inconvenience , there 's no stop . The only possible restriction might be if there are certain regulations that ca n't be overcome . "  *Are we all heading for Uber-careers ? What does it say about the future of labour ?  " It presents new opportunities , for sure . I know people that just love it , for a couple of reasons . One is , it gives them extra cash in their off time job opportunity , especially if they love to drive . But that 's the whole part of the sharing economy . It basically takes a look at everything that 's part of our lives , whether it 's pets or food or clothing , the things we normally spend money on , and it says , " OK , so what 's another way of acquiring or sharing that , that presents an alternative that we did n't have before ? "  * What does it mean for the people working these jobs and for job security ?  " The entire economy wo n't be ' Uberized , ' it can not be ' Uberized . ' I mean , a big part of our economy is the service sector , the government sector , policing , health care -- that ca n't be ' Uberized . '  *Some people have raised the spectre of " Uberized " health care .  " I personally hope so . I personally hope there are alternatives presented because the beautiful thing about Uber is you do n't have to use they 're better . "  *What 's one thing you would want taxi drivers in Toronto to accept at this point ?  " You ca n't go back . There was a time before credit cards , there was a time before bank machines , there was a time before virtual banking . "  *On the other hand , what 's something you would want UberX drivers to know ?  " They 're on the first wave . These are the early days of ride-sharing . There will be legislative changes . "  *Right now it 's transportation and taxis . Which industry is next in line for someone like AirBnB or Uber to disrupt ?  " The one I love is pets . That 's the one that 's caught my attention because the pet industry is huge . And it 's very expensive to have a pet and to look after it . The other one 's that big down here is renting high-end clothing and accessories . So you may want a Hermes purse sometimes . But the Hermes purse is $13,000 the Hermes purse for x , y -- who 'd have thought ?
