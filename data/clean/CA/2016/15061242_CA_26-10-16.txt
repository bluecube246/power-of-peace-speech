BUSINESS REPORT : Dream of detached home to stay out of reach for most  Perhaps a tone of sarcasm in Brent Jang 's column in this morning 's Globe and Mail : " Do n't worry about the backyard because there wo n't be one . "  Price Waterhouse Cooper and the Urban Land Institute released a new report this morning reaffirming some very apparent trends in the housing market , and perhaps answering the question whether the opportunity for a housing correction ( that we are potentially amidst ) will change any of these issues .  The main takeaway is simply that they project detached single family homes will remain out of reach of average incomes over the long term as cities continue to densify , and referencing Vancouver and Toronto in particular .  Interesting , as they note when contrasting , say , Vancouver and Calgary , is the condo craze has n't caught on in markets where there is n't enough of price difference between condos and homes , as both remain entry level options .  Also interesting is moving to the big cities , which is a trend increasing the need for supply .
