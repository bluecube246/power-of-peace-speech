programm  ' a torrid marriage of logic and emotion ' ( album stream )  last year , toronto four-piece programm delivered their like the sun ep , and now the group are ready to follow it up with their debut full-length offering a torrid marriage of logic and emotion .  the new album hears the band working with producer alexandre bonenfant ( metz , crystal castles ) to solidify their wide-ranging influences into a cohesive sound . drawing from eastern music to drone to minimalist electronica , the band manage to craft a uniquely moody vibe .  blurring the lines between electronica , industrial and shoegaze , the new songs are dark but melodic . menacing pulsating rhythms are brightened with bursts of bright synths , while hazy and at times angelic vocals lift the listener out of ominous instrumentation across the eight-track set .  a torrid marriage of logic and emotion is officially out on april 22 through the hand recordings , but you can give it an early listen in the player below right now .
