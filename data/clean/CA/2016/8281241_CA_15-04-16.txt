Programm  ' A Torrid Marriage of Logic and Emotion ' ( album stream )  Last year , Toronto four-piece Programm delivered their Like the Sun EP , and now the group are ready to follow it up with their debut full-length offering A Torrid Marriage of Logic and Emotion .  The new album hears the band working with producer Alexandre Bonenfant ( METZ , Crystal Castles ) to solidify their wide-ranging influences into a cohesive sound . Drawing from Eastern music to drone to minimalist electronica , the band manage to craft a uniquely moody vibe .  Blurring the lines between electronica , industrial and shoegaze , the new songs are dark but melodic . Menacing pulsating rhythms are brightened with bursts of bright synths , while hazy and at times angelic vocals lift the listener out of ominous instrumentation across the eight-track set .  A Torrid Marriage of Logic and Emotion is officially out on April 22 through the Hand Recordings , but you can give it an early listen in the player below right now .
