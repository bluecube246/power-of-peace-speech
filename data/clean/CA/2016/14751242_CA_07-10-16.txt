education minister 's " open letter " to parents draws fire from vsb  with a week that 's seen the vancouver school board mired in allegations of bullying , the education minister is hoping to have the final word on the furor .  mike bernier has sent what his ministry has described as an " open letter to parents , " but the recipients could easily also be the vsb itself .  " we will work to ensure teachers , principals and staff at the vancouver school board are supported through this period , " bernier writes .  and says he wants to reassure parents , at least , that the recent allegations of bullying are being " taken seriously . "  earlier this week the education minister told reporters he is " seriously considering replacing the vancouver school board , but says he would wait for a worksafebc report into the bullying allegations .  dysfunction and toxicity  but a vancouver school trustee is slamming the move , claiming the letter just spreads more " dysfuntion and toxicity . " to stir further turmoil .  " when nothing of that nature has been proven , he knows there are investigations underway . " " why he is sending out that kind of message and almost like he 's repeating rumours ; it 's irresponsible and it needs to stop . "  bernier received a letter from the bc school superintendents association containing serious allegations of a toxic work environment .  a copy of that letter , obtained by our sister station global bc 's keith baldrey includes the following excerpt :  ' the vancouver school board work environment continually and cumulatively creates a toxicity which fosters fear and a lack of sense of safety for those lead educators as the expectations requested of them are unmanageable . ' ... they are asking the ministry to intervene . "  six senior administrators at the vsb have now taken indefinite medical leave , including the superintendent of schools who had been leading the vsb school closure process .  earlier this month , the board voted to suspend the process which had 11 schools potentially on the chopping @ @
