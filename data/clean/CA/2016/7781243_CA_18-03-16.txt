( mark blinch for the globe and mail )  millennials are watching television like no other age group since the dawn of the tube -- they 're doing it any time , anywhere . but while those unpredictable viewing habits create headaches for prime-time programmers and people selling advertising time , a recent study suggests millennials wo n't disrupt sports programming to the same extent . and that would be a relief to networks that have paid billions for broadcast rights .  that does n't mean rights-holders are in the clear that multiplatform viewing demands a new structure for such rights contracts , with a greater emphasis on mobile and digital platforms as opposed to conventional television . networks need other revenue streams to make up for lower conventional tv ratings for almost all sports , declining cable subscriptions and , especially , rising rights fees for sports properties .  trouble is , no one has figured out how to generate those replacement revenues . as a result , both rogers media and bell media , which own sportsnet and tsn , respectively , noted in their most recent annual reports that increased rights fees were the most significant factor limiting the networks ' earnings .  the millennial effect is supposed to be the undoing of tv 's business model . there were those ominous stories about how declining subscriptions , cord-cutting and high costs at espn , the u.s. cable-sports behemoth , had been a drag on its parent company , walt disney co . and there 's still a fear that pick-and-pay and unbundling will slash subscription numbers for canadian sports networks , too .  there is . skeptics have doubted the network axiom -- that live sports events attract a demographic that sponsors crave , 18- to 55-year-old men who prefer to tune in live , on whatever platform they use , in real time .  media analysts are divided on whether broadcasters have overpaid for the rights deals . but none of them sees any imminent decline in revenue for the leagues , thanks to one factor : sports provide programming that viewers -- even millennials -- are willing to consume live , rather than recording it for later .  " think for a minute what happened with the toronto blue jays , " says gord hendren , founder of charlton strategic research inc. , referring to the baseball team 's run to the american league championship series last fall . " those ratings went through the roof and they captured millennials . they might watch it on the internet , they might watch it on their phone , they might consume it on social media . but if the content is compelling -- and the blue jays are a great example -- the as the result of a survey his market research firm conducted last september . in a survey of 500 sports fans aged 12 to 70 across canada , the largest group of those who described themselves as " big fans " of the blue jays -- 54 per cent -- were millennials and younger .  many of these fans would have little to no memory of the blue jays ' world series runs in 1992 and 1993 , so it is an encouraging sign for both broadcasters and sports teams -- laggards , such as the edmonton oilers and toronto maple leafs , can count on their fans being there when they finally get back into contention .  but that is small consolation for rogers , which has to find a way to break even on its 12-year , $5.2-billion deal with the nhl for the canadian broadcast rights . the bad news is that , since the leafs have the largest fan base of the seven canadian nhl teams , their plummeting tv ratings over the past two seasons have caused much pain for rogers . worse still and advertising-revenue bonanza , the media company is facing the prospect of a playoff season without a single canadian franchise . that is devastating to its budget projections and reportedly is already having an effect on staffing levels .  kaan yigit , president of solutions research group in toronto , says the nhl has gained consumers who have started to follow the league on digital and social media in recent years . but the communications and technology consultant adds that the gains did not offset the losses of conventional tv viewers . by december of 2015 , an srg survey of 500 canadians showed , the number of canadians aged 12 and above who consume the nhl on digital and social media increased 9 per cent , but in the same period , the number watching on television dropped 22 per cent . over all , there was an 11-per-cent decline in canadians who watch the nhl on any platform .  but the nhl remains the no. 1 sport to watch among canadians ; the srg survey showed 50 per cent of the respondents said they follow the league second , with 36 per cent .  as for millennials , an srg survey in december , 2014 , found 33 per cent watch hockey online , on mobile devices or on social media ; 31 per cent still watch games on tv .  the nhl broadcast contract is structured so that rogers paid the smallest annual amount in 2014-15 , the first season of the deal . the payments will rise each year over the next 11 seasons . hendren thinks rogers has a chance to turn a profit on the deal for two reasons . first , he says , " two-thirds of canadians still watch conventional television , " which means there will still be sizable tv audiences to sell to advertisers . the other is that millennials are still willing to watch games in the conventional way if they have a good reason , such as their teams ' playoff runs .  jays audiences on sportsnet , for instance , went from an average of 600,000 per regular-season game in july to 1.61 million during the september stretch drive . the playoffs saw the game in the american league championship series , which toronto lost to the kansas city royals , pulling in 5.13 million viewers , a record for sportsnet .  hendren thinks the same dynamic will benefit rogers if canadian nhl teams become more competitive . " if you get the content right , the potential for sports is big , " he says , adding : " if the leafs get contending again , they would exceed all numbers . "  a more cautious opinion comes from mario mota , co-founder of boon dog professional services inc. , a research and consulting company in ottawa . he thinks the numbers of cord-cutters ( those who drop their cable or satellite tv subscriptions ) and cord-nevers ( millennials who do n't subscribe once they live on their own ) will continue to grow because , critics say , the telecom companies are passing on the rising costs of sports rights to consumers ' monthly bills .  " if the costs of sports packages continue to rise the way they have been , at some point there is a limit for  he does not see the solution in the recent arrival of skinny bundles , which the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission forced on the cable companies . the problem is that the most popular sports networks , sportsnet and tsn , are not part of the new stripped-down packages , which cost about $25 a month plus the cost of renting a cable box . the total cost of a package that includes both sportsnet and tsn is more than $70 per month .  " if you 're paying more every year in rights fees and it 's increasingly a challenge to earn more and more advertising revenue , and there are people cutting the cord and cord-shaving , meaning your subscriber numbers are going down , it does n't take a rocket scientist to say that 's going to be a challenging environment for any sports broadcaster , " mota says .  between 2010 and 2014 , according to the most recent figures published by the crtc , sportsnet lost about 840,000 subscribers , a decline of 9 per cent to 8.3 million . tsn 's decline same period to nine million . but the crtc has not yet published the 2015 numbers , which may show an increase for sportsnet because it included its first season with the nhl rights .  despite the loss of subscribers , tsn and sportsnet saw a sharp increase in revenue between 2010 and 2014 because both networks negotiated an increase in the fees they receive from cable operators that carry them . there was also increased revenue from existing subscribers , because both networks added new pay channels . tsn 's revenue climbed to $452.2-million in 2014 from $267.6-million in 2010 ( before the loss of nhl national rights to rogers kicked in ) . sportsnet pulled in $311.9-million in 2014 , up from $216.9-million in 2010 .  despite this , both rogers and bell said in their last annual reports that the rising costs of sports rights deals held down profit . the companies attributed the hundreds of layoffs at bell media and rogers media in the past several months to the decline in revenue due caused by cord-cutting .  are the broadcasters complaints about rights fees figure out how to sell digital ads and subscriptions to generate new revenue ?  mota says that , while bell and rogers complain about soaring fees , they are unlikely to stop bidding up the prices . " in canada , you have healthy competition between bell and rogers for rights . you can bet when any kind of rights come up for renewal , they 'll be tripping over themselves to outbid each other .  " there 's kind of an irrationality in the market because of this environment . plus , they need content . tsn has now expanded to five feeds , sportsnet has four or five , and they 've got to fill that air time .  " the question becomes : as publicly-traded companies , how long can they keep going , making deals like that and not making the returns their shareholders require and demand , before saying there has to be a better way to do this ? "  a traditional broadcast deal calls for the network to pay a sports league an annual fee . then , it turns to its cable channels . hendren and mota say that future broadcast deals will be driven by subscription revenue more than ad revenue . the companies will concentrate more on selling wireless and digital subscriptions for mobile devices and streaming packages .  bill kunz , a veteran u.s. network television producer and an associate professor of interdisciplinary arts and sciences at the university of washington , studies broadcast issues . he thinks there will be a shift to a subscription-based approach .  " they talk so much about cord-cutting , but the one thing that limits that is live sports , " kunz says . " what 's keeping some of these services , cable and satellite in the u.s. , afloat is live content . but , yes , the delivery model is likely to change . the broadcasters will figure out a different way to monetize it . but i do n't know that the amount will be radically different . "  while networks have so far failed to fully monetize digital and mobile platforms , kunz says the u.s. national broadcast contracts with the nfl five more years to run , " so there is time enough to figure it out . "  mota , though , thinks rogers is facing significant risk because of this , as its contract with the nhl does not expire until 2026 . " in an environment where television is changing so rapidly , who can predict in 12 years what the world is going to look like ? "  but hendren believes the saving grace for rogers will be the fact that , unlike most of the u.s. networks ' deals , it has locked up all media rights , including television , radio , mobile and digital . so if the monetization progresses , the money will flow to rogers .  analysts are dubious of the peak-sports theory .  " is it the end of media companies paying billions ? i do n't think it is the end , " hendren says . " i think it has big value for them . no. 1 , it 's content that 's driven across their multiple platforms . no. 2 , in terms of creating of a particular service if you have particular features or particular content you can push . that leads to subscription revenue in a world we 're moving to , which is pick and pay . "  what 's happening in the united states now suggests rogers ' move to tie up all nhl rights may be the right one . yahoo -- rather than the nhl 's u.s. television partner , nbc -- recently signed a deal with the league to live-stream four games a week for free , along with highlights and other content ( the games will not be seen in canada thanks to the rogers contract ) .  yahoo inc. is making strong moves to woo mobile-watching millennials , as the company already has streaming deals with the nfl , mlb and the pga . and social-media giant facebook is live-streaming professional boxing .  rogers is promising to do much the same here . " it 's our job , though , " rogers chief executive officer guy laurence noted in an interview with the globe and mail in may of 2015 , " to and then work out how to monetize it , not force the public to watch content in a particular way because that 's how we 've monetized it in the past .
