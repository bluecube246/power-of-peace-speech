( JASON FRANSON/THE CANADIAN PRESS ) <p> Alberta Premier Rachel Notley , centre , speaks with small business owners and non-profit businesses during a prebudget meeting attends a prebudget meeting at the Alberta School of Business in Edmonton on Wednesday . ( JASON FRANSON/THE CANADIAN PRESS ) <p> Alberta 's Finance Minister says he has no idea when the province 's budget will be balanced , months after promising the deficit would be eliminated before the end of the decade . <p> The governing New Democrats will post deficits for an indeterminate period as revenues languish because of the crash in oil prices and as the public need for services grows , Joe Ceci said in an interview with The Globe and Mail . <p> There is no longer a hard-and-fast target date for balance , he said . <p> " It 's just wishful thinking if you think you can identify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin in a timeline and say this is when we 're going to return to balance that it would mean some drastic cuts across the board in this province . " <p> Mr. Ceci has said his 2016-17 budget , set for April 14 , will include a shortfall of $10.4-billion , Alberta 's largest since the early 1990s . In an interim budget last October , the government set a target of 2019 to get back into the black . <p> The NDP is promising to protect health care , education and other services . The energy-market collapse has prompted tens of thousands of job cuts in the oil patch , putting more pressure on the government to maintain basic services . <p> The deficit disclosure comes one day after federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled his first budget , backing away from an election pledge to balance the books by 2019 and offering no new target to do so . He projected a $29.4-billion deficit in 2016-17 , triple what the Justin Trudeau Liberals promised in the election . <p> The federal deficit is projected to fall to $17.4-billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Like Alberta , the federal government is trying to deal with a weak economy , caused partly by skidding oil prices . Both levels of government have pledged multibillion-dollar infrastructure programs as stimulus . Mr. Ceci has laid out a plan to spend $34.5-billion over five years on bridges , roads , schools and hospitals , funded by debt . <p> " There 's a lot of mirroring of circumstances going on here , " Mr. Ceci said of his budget and the one tabled by Mr. Morneau . " And I just feel that 's the reality we 're in as governments right now and we need to have a long-term vision on how to get back to some sense of balance . <p> " We 're going to carry a $10.4-billion deficit this year . There 'll be another deficit the year after that , and not unlike Morneau , we 're going to have to look in the long term to sort this out . " <p> Alberta 's governments have struggled to balance the books over the past decade , even when oil was above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's level of around $40 . Since the financial crisis in 2008 , a number of Progressive Conservative premiers returned only one balanced budget , a $1.1-billion ( Canadian ) surplus in 2014-15 . <p> After campaigning on a promise to shield Albertans from drastic cuts to services , Premier Rachel Notley boosted social spending while raising both corporate taxes and income taxes for those making more than $125,000 a year . <p> The NDP 's 2015 election platform included a pledge to balance the province 's budget by 2018 . After months of persistently weak oil prices , October 's budget pushed that target to 2019 . <p> Mr. Ceci ruled out any further revenue increases , such as a sales tax or higher income taxes , but he said his budget will not weaken health and education services . It 's a sharp philosophical contrast to former premier Ralph Klein 's PC government in the 1990s , which cut deeply to balance the books . <p> " Albertans need to know that those are all solid things that they can continue to count on , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain his spending plan to investors and bond-rating agencies , which have already raised red flags about rising debt levels . Before Alberta 's next general election , set for 2019 , the province will begin borrowing money to finance the day-to-day operations of government -- something it has n't done since 1994 . Mr. Ceci will need to persuade creditors that the province is a solid investment . <p> " We have to lay out a plan that is reasonable , responsible , and stick to it , " he said . " We 've got the lowest , or one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in Canada -- we 're good . It 's going to go up and there is no way around it , but if we can deliver on our plans , I think we 'll be all right . " <h> Also on The Globe and Mail <p> Alberta needs Ottawa 's help , but what about the rest of the country ? ( BNN Video )
