" -- so it is indeed a shame that they 've packed up their gowns and made way for male hosts to resume centre stage .  luckily , there 's no shortage of dynamic female duos ( and trios and quartets ) doing cool , funny stuff in toronto , so you can get your fey-poehler-esque cultural fix whenever the mood strikes . start with drunk feminist films , a feminist collective that knocks hollywood gender stereotypes down a few pegs by screening blockbusters like twilight , fifty shades of grey and love actually , and mocking the living crap out of them . drinking games add to the hilarity and the events always sell out , so book quickly for the feb. 4 and 6 screenings of bring it on .  according to t&amp;a lore , the pair began their legendary best friendship at second city in chicago , so why not check out toronto 's sketch comedy scene for our own next big thing(s) ? my money 's on steph tolev and allison hogg , the brains behind sketch duo ladystache . and countless live performances under their belts , tolev and hogg might just follow in tina and amy 's footsteps .  and since this whole love fest is basically a celebration of smart , quick-witted women , delve into meat locker editions , a not-for-profit organization dedicated to publishing the works of young writers ( mostly women , all of them smart ) . founders sarah beaudin ( a designer and publisher ) and madeleine curry ( a freelance editor ) also run community events , including a monthly reading series and the book bike , a mobile lending library -- literally on a bike -- that circles the city from may through october .
