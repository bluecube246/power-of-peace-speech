what science says about how wildfires work  the fire in fort mcmurray is " about as explosive as you can get . " here 's why .  forest fires happen every year , and a bit of burning is important for a healthy ecosytem . but this season is different -- and not just because the city of fort mcmurray is in the path of destruction . in the words of jen beverly , who teaches fire science and management at the university of alberta , this conflagration is " about as explosive as you can get . " here 's why .  heat  spring came a full month early in alberta , thanks in part to the global warm phase el ni ? o . temps have been 2 to 4 c above normal . fort mcmurray topped 31 c wednesday . northern alberta also got 75 per cent less rain and snow than expected in recent months , and the snow melted sooner -- leaving the forest warm , dry , and highly flammable .  wind  wind propels fires . if you 've ever put your face near an open oven door , you know heat rises . that upward motion carries burning embers high into the air , where the wind can toss them horizontally by up to a kilometre . that 's how the blaze , helped by winds gusting to 50 km/h , hopped over a river . huge fires also make their own winds : fire whorls .  fuel  fort mcmurray is in canada 's vast boreal forest , which is mostly ( combustible ! ) evergreen trees . trees with juicy green leaves , on the other hand , are a natural fire retardant . but there 's a window -- it opened very early this year -- in the spring , after the snow melts and before leaves bloom , when the forest floor is full of dry leaves and needles : fire food .  can this fire be fought ?  firefighters measure the energy of a fire in kilowatts per metre of fire front : the part where flames meet fresh forest . in a fire this intense ( people anywhere near , " the front , scientist jen beverly says . that leaves indirect methods , like using planes to drop water and fire retardant . except : the tops of the trees are on fire , and it 's hard for pilots to see through the smoke . controlled burns or bulldozers can remove some fuel in the fire 's path -- but that 's not always safe in populated areas . until there 's a good long rain , " there 's not much we can do , " beverly says . " these are the most extreme burning conditions you can see . "
