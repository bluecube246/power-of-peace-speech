the day-to-day aspects of life that should n't have been a challenge were incredibly difficult under the weight of her depression , she remembers .  but , for the spruce grove business owner , yoga was her one escape and allowed her to clear her mind .  " it was just a time of day where i could feel like myself , i could feel light , " jolicoeur explained . " ( depression ) is a really , really heavy feeling all the time , so if there 's a couple minutes in your day where you can actually get out from underneath that weight , it can make a huge difference in that **30;614;toolong process . "  yoga helped jolicoeur break the chains that held her in depression , and now the yoga instructor at be free yoga in spruce grove wants to share that same hope with others .  last fall , she began formulating her plan for the be free project .  the project began with the goal of eliminating the shame and stigma surrounding mental illness and and meditation . it will offer workshops , classes and events in the community to create awareness and offer hope .  " i really wanted to give other people the tools of yoga and meditation that they maybe would n't be able to access otherwise , " she said .  now , with the help of others , her vision is about to come to fruition .  " even though i had a really great support system behind me , not everybody has that luxury , " said jolicoeur , who still felt ashamed in her struggle with depression despite the love and support of family and friends . " it 's been a process to work through that , so any way we can help people work through that with yoga and meditation is really exciting . "  jolicoeur has spoken with mental health nurses to determine how the be free project can best serve those dealing with mental illness .  the be free project will offer classes , free of charge , to people on the journey to recovering from depression and other problems they can feel safe , " jolicoeur said . " when people go through depression and these different things , sometimes we 're not able to work , and it 's not always accessible for us to get to a yoga studio , or if you 've never done yoga before it can be really intimidating to come in to a studio . so we just want to make it really accessible for anybody to drop in free of charge . "  to raise funds to get the project started , be free yoga will be holding community for a cause : yoga in the park , a mini yoga festival at jubilee park in spruce grove on june 21 from 5-9 p.m. to coincide with international day of yoga . the event will include a yoga and meditation class , bohemian market and food truck .  tickets for the outdoor yoga event are $15 each until june 10 and $20 after that . they can be purchased online at www.befreeproject.ca under the events section . tickets can also be purchased at the door .  jolicoeur hopes to month .  " i 'm really excited to get this going and start talking about mental health , " she said . " it needs to be at the forefront of more conversations . "
