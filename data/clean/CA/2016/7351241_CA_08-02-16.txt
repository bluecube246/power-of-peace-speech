donald trump gets the devotion of the disaffected in new hampshire add to ...  inside the low-ceilinged main room of the elks lodge in salem , bill frisone and billy strules slide into a row of seats to await their first-ever political event . mr. strules , a 58-year-old building contractor , ca n't remember the last time he voted in any election . " we 're the least political people in the world , " adds mr. frisone , 52 .  yet the two men , best friends for four decades , made sure to be here on monday morning for only one reason : donald trump . it 's the first time in their lives that they identify with a candidate enough to support him in person and to make sure they 're registered to vote .  " he 's finally talking about the things that got swept under the carpet , " mr. strules says . things like kicking people off welfare and getting them back to work , or shutting the country 's borders to illegal immigrants , he says race is the way that certain candidates are making inroads with voters who long ago gave up on the electoral process . on the republican side , mr. trump has tapped into a group of disaffected citizens who skew republican . on the democratic side , vermont senator bernie sanders is accomplishing something similar .  one day remains before new hampshire voters go to the polls in a pivotal primary that will determine whether mr. trump 's popularity can actually translate into a victory at the ballot box . after finishing second in the iowa caucuses to texas senator ted cruz , he needs to win to prove that his insurgent candidacy remains a force to be reckoned with .  sweeping in from a side door , mr. trump , in a dark suit and a striped tie , does n't disappoint them .  he promises to get tough -- with the china on trade deals , with iran on its nuclear weapons and with the islamic state . " i guarantee you that is is laughing like hell at the u.s. " when politicians debate the legality 'm going to be the worst thing that ever happened to them . "  mr. trump skewers those he dislikes , particularly former florida governor jeb bush . he does a mocking imitation of mr. bush 's voice and calls him " a total stiff , " " a spoiled child , " a lightweight " and " not a smart man . "  mostly , he assures the assembled voters that he will take care of things , offering very few details . " we got ta get apple to make their computers in the u.s. , okay ? " he says .  he asserts that the key is preventing currency manipulation . " i know how to play that game better than anybody . believe me , we 're going to be so competitive . "  mr. trump emphasizes that he is self-funding his campaign , which means he is n't beholden to moneyed interests . in a typically bombastic statement , he claims that had he taken outside contributions , he would have already amassed a fund of $500-million or more .  when in the eye and tell them that they are not welcome in the u.s. , mr. trump does n't hesitate to say yes . " we do n't know where their parents came from , " he says . " they have no documents whatsoever . they may be isis . "  for good measure , he casts aspersions on all migrants travelling to europe . " where the hell do they get their cellphones ? " he bellows . " who 's paying the bill for the cellphones ? "  for voters like mr. strules and mr. frisone , mr. trump is right on the mark . mr. frisone says he would support mr. trump 's call to prevent muslims from entering the united states . " it 's a start , " he says . " perhaps not to that extreme . "  mr. trump urges everyone in the room at attend a large rally later on monday in manchester and , most of all , to vote in tuesday 's primary . then , after he stops speaking , he is mobbed by people requesting the crowd and emerges a few minutes later , beaming : mr. trump has signed the inside of mr. frisone 's hat , which bears the campaign 's slogan , make america great again .
