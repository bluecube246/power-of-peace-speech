" i wanted to see what was available because i was interested in the local flavours , meat vendors , vegetables and other produce , " she said . " i 'm pleasantly surprised and if i was a vendor , i 'd probably consider having a booth here myself . "  she had been interested in checking out the market for awhile after hearing about it from others in the community .  " i 've actually been trying to come for the last few saturdays until i realized it just opened today , " she said with a laugh . " so , i 've been really looking forward to it . "  one of this year 's new vendors , the fromagerie kapuskoise , also brought cheese to the market so attendees could sample and purchase fresh and squeaky curds and other fine cheeses .  as part of a new artisanal program , local meat producer acres chicken for the first time .  levesque said the market is an age-old tradition that connects vendors and consumers together to meet , mingle and learn more about the food production process .  " it 's community-based with local farmers and artisans coming together to bring northern products to the northern community , " he explained . " it 's important that when people come in and buy fresh vegetables and cheeses , they are able to talk to the people who made them . then , they can better understand where their food comes from and the quality of it , they can ask questions about the process , and they can understand the importance of having fresh food .

" i like being here because it brings an appreciation and an awareness to the fact that we have a lot of talent in this community , " he said . " hopefully , this will encourage other people to say , ' hey , there is a market for this , ' because there are industries coming up in the north that will make it more interesting and a better place to live . "  throughout the summer , the market will also be partnering with other community non-profits and  organizations to host fundraisers and special themed market days .  while it has a home said the market may also have to find a new facility once the municipality decides what to do with the aging building .  the 50-year-old hall is in need of significant repairs , and the city has so far been unwilling to shell out the capital to complete them -- making the future of the market at its current location unknown .  " we 're dedicated to this space for as long as we have it , but we 're just encouraging people to come out and enjoy it because there 's a question mark on how long it will be here in this location , " levesque said . " we ask the community for any ideas to keep this going and although it 's the people and not the structure that makes the market and community , we also need facilities to keep this going . it 's important to work together to do that . "  the mountjoy independent farmers ' market will be held every saturday until about mid-october at the centennial hall , 814 park ave. , from 8 a.m. to noon .
