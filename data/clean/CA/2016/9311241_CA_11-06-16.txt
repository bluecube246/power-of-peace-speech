<p> Last year Stratford City FC did n't score its 17th goal of the regular season until Aug. 21 , a 2-1 win over Guelph in the team 's 14th match . <p> Fast forward nearly 10 months later and the first-place Kitchener and District Soccer League men 's premier club has scored that many goals in seven matches after a 5-1 win over Hrvat at Rotary Park . <p> Stratford improved to 6-0-1 . <p> " One thing we 've proven so far this year is from the first to 90th minute we 're always trying to score , " head coach Jim Grogan said . " Guys keep the pressure on . " <p> What made City FC 's latest victory impressive was that five different players scored . <p> Aap Inthasian , Kurtis Bailey , Ashley Adams , Jordan Hayle and Ryan Harrison all found the back of the net . <p> " It 's tough to beat a team when they have balanced scoring like that , and we 've really had that this year , " Grogan said . " I hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the second half , the suddenly potent City FC offence erupted for four goals in 20 minutes . <p> Hayle started the onslaught after out-muscling a Hrvat defender and sending an off-balance shot toward the net from the top of the box . The rebound was kicked high into the air , and Adams headed it past the Hrvat keeper for the winning goal . <p> Hayle made it 3-1 moments later when he scored into an open net after pressuring the Hrvat keeper and blocking his kick . <p> " The third goal was huge , " Grogan said . " That really took the wind out of their sails and ( was ) opportunistic . Picked a good time to pressure the back line and stepped in front of the ball and ( it was a ) tap in . " <p> Bailey took advantage of the aggressive Hrvat keeper and also had a goal gift-wrapped late in the second half , while Harrison had a tap-in of his own after Adams ' header was stopped but the ball fell to Harrison 's feet with no one around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , we punish them more times than not , " Grogan said . <p> Stratford is averaging nearly 2.5 goals per match with nearly the same roster as last season , when it averaged 1.5 . Grogan made some changes to the lineup , moving strikers Harrison and Bailey to central midfield . <p> " I 'm not sure if that 's the only reason , but Kurtis is always a threat , " Grogan said . " Either one of them , because of their abilities as strikers , they 're able to run at defenders . They 're also good passers . " <p> Grogan also implemented some strategic changes -- short passes , different positioning and structure -- that have benefitted the rotation of Adams , Hayle and Inthasian up front . <p> " We 're just going to keep working with that , " Grogan said . " We 're getting better chances this year , too , I really believe that . We had chances last year too , and we were snake-bit a couple times , but overall we 're creating way more chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midfield are something to do with that . " <p> City FC will play a Dasilva Cup semifinal match Wednesday against Bridgeport ( location TBD ) and face Sonnys FC next Sunday night , also on the road . <p> The team is confident , Grogan said , but it 's also not getting ahead of itself . <p> " We expect to win every game now . We 're off to a great start , but that 's all it is. "
