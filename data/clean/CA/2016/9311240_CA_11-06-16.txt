to raise awareness about homelessness , members of the team spent the night sleeping in cardboard boxes during their recent byob event at wallenstein feed &amp; supply co .  the creative boxes -- one had a flower box and another looked like a church with stained-glass windows -- were guaranteed to attract attention . the wallenswine team has been an enthusiastic supporter of the annual hog jog which raises funds for a different local organization each year .  this year proceeds from the 11th instalment of the hog jog june 22 at the stratford rotary complex will support stratford/perth shelterlink .  shelterlink was founded in 1991 to provide homeless and at-risk youth between 16 and 24 with a safe place to live , along with food , basic needs , advocacy , life skills and other services .  hog jog co-chair bill macdougald said when the committee was looking at applications , shelterlink rose to the top of the pile .  " it 's a cause you 're not necessarily aware of unless you 're involved . it 's just such a shelterlink provided direct services to 231 youth and fielded another 3,500 calls and emails , many of which led to referrals to other agencies .  " the money they raise for us is a game changer , " said bev hagedorn , shelterlink executive director . " we feel very fortunate to be chosen . we could never be able to get that amount of money any other way . "  last year the hog jog raised more than $40,000 . the wallenswine team raised about $16,000 of that .  the money raised will make it possible for shelterlink to run a program called new life story . the program helps youth develop a plan for their health , social life and financial responsibilities needed to live an independent life .  " sometimes , when we get older we forget the assistance we had along the way , " hagedorn said .  the youth who come to shelterlink have n't had adult guidance and " have a lot to make peace with , " she said .  " we help strengthen them and stand them going to school , youth who live at the hostel compete with their peers for jobs .  " our society is not set up to provide jobs for someone whose address is a homeless shelter or who ca n't read or write very well , " hagedorn noted .  to participate in the hog jog there 's no need to run or even jog . there is a 3.5-km walk or run , a 10-km run and a 500-metre weaner run for kids six years old and under . there are also opportunities to show support online . each registrant will get a pork-on-a-bun meal and the chance to win a prize .  organizers are expecting about 500 runners and walkers again this year .
