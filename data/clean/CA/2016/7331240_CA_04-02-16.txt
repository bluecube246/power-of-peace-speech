<h> Connect with Us <h> Driver loses lawsuit against City of Surrey , worker <p> A woman who sued the City of Surrey and a maintenance worker for a 2012 collision has lost her lawsuit . <p> Roshan Ara Ali claimed that truck driver Rajinder Sandhu and the City of Surrey were responsible for a collision that took place near the exit of a parking lot on Scott Road near 95 Avenue . <p> The city and Sandhu argued that Ali was at fault because she illegally passed Sandhu 's 40-foot truck on the right . <p> Ali testified on her own behalf , claiming she was leaving the parking lot of her bank when she got stuck behind a large , slow-moving truck . She said she moved her vehicle to the right -- the direction she wanted to turn on to Scott Road -- believing the truck was turning left . She then claimed the truck 's reverse lights came on and it reversed into her , striking the side of her car on an angle . <p> Sandhu , who was servicing sewer pipes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right turn onto Scott Road -- under the direction of two safety workers -- when he heard a " crunch . " It was only then , he said , that he saw Ali 's vehicle on his right . He said he was never backing up in the parking lot . <p> The investigating Surrey RCMP officer testified Ali 's version of events was not consistent with the vehicle damage he saw , as there was no damage to the rear of the truck Ali claimed had reversed into her . <p> In her Feb. 1 decision , Justice Martha Devlin sided with the city and Sandhu , noting Ali was not a credible witness . <p> " Her version of events was sometimes vague and changed throughout her testimony , depending on what aspect of her testimony was challenged , " said Devlin . " As a result her testimony was internally inconsistent and contradictory . " <p> The judge also questioned Ali 's revelation that in 2014 , two years after the crash , she encountered a woman who had witnesses the incident . While first saying she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prior contact -- a suggestion Devlin said the plaintiff tried to " explain away " at trial . <p> " Ms. Ali 's explanation of how she discovered the supposed witness ... was most damaging to her credibility even though the witness did not testify at trial . " <p> Devlin concluded Ali was solely responsible for the collision , dismissing her lawsuit , with costs . <p> We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story 's topic , but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards .
