Connect with Us  Driver loses lawsuit against City of Surrey , worker  A woman who sued the City of Surrey and a maintenance worker for a 2012 collision has lost her lawsuit .  Roshan Ara Ali claimed that truck driver Rajinder Sandhu and the City of Surrey were responsible for a collision that took place near the exit of a parking lot on Scott Road near 95 Avenue .  The city and Sandhu argued that Ali was at fault because she illegally passed Sandhu 's 40-foot truck on the right .  Ali testified on her own behalf , claiming she was leaving the parking lot of her bank when she got stuck behind a large , slow-moving truck . She said she moved her vehicle to the right -- the direction she wanted to turn on to Scott Road -- believing the truck was turning left . She then claimed the truck 's reverse lights came on and it reversed into her , striking the side of her car on an angle .  Sandhu , who was servicing sewer pipes and right turn onto Scott Road -- under the direction of two safety workers -- when he heard a " crunch . " It was only then , he said , that he saw Ali 's vehicle on his right . He said he was never backing up in the parking lot .  The investigating Surrey RCMP officer testified Ali 's version of events was not consistent with the vehicle damage he saw , as there was no damage to the rear of the truck Ali claimed had reversed into her .  In her Feb. 1 decision , Justice Martha Devlin sided with the city and Sandhu , noting Ali was not a credible witness .  " Her version of events was sometimes vague and changed throughout her testimony , depending on what aspect of her testimony was challenged , " said Devlin . " As a result her testimony was internally inconsistent and contradictory . "  The judge also questioned Ali 's revelation that in 2014 , two years after the crash , she encountered a woman who had witnesses the incident . While first saying she had prior contact -- a suggestion Devlin said the plaintiff tried to " explain away " at trial .  " Ms. Ali 's explanation of how she discovered the supposed witness ... was most damaging to her credibility even though the witness did not testify at trial . "  Devlin concluded Ali was solely responsible for the collision , dismissing her lawsuit , with costs .
