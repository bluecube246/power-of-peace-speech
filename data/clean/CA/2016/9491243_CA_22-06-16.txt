Had just about enough of some Facebook users  I have been roaming around Facebook for a bit - long enough to observe that some folks should n't be there .  You 've seen them - or rather , you 've read their posts . Take the TMI group , or the ones who offer Too Much Information .  And I mean way , way too much .  They 're the ones who want to tell you every last symptom of the recent flu they had . They 're the ones who want to tell you every sordid detail in their divorce proceedings . They 're the ones who want to tell you about their struggles with the bank account and their dealings with the boss .  Please , I want to tell them . Keep it to yourself .  Then there 's the RRB gang . Like the TMIs , the RRBs really should be required to take a course in appropriate Facebook behaviour .  That 's because they 're Really , Really Boring .  " Woke up at shower , then breakfast ( eggs and toast , unbuttered ) . Flossed . Now going to do crossword with a coffee at hand . ( Cream , no sugar . ) " Sometimes , the RRBs will upsell their brilliant posts with a photo of said dental floss or coffee cup .  Ban them , I say . For life .  Equally annoying is the UB pack . Oh , you know them well , my friends .  They 're the Ultimate Braggers .  The UB will post news - always with a photo album - of little Johnny when he 's ( 1 ) lost his first tooth , ( 2 ) created his first finger painting , or ( 3 ) sat through his first meal without hurling Alphagetti at his sister .  The UBs also want the world to know they 're the best of the best at - you name it - photography , cooking , gardening , soap carving or competitive dog grooming .  They appear on FB every day , and I 'd like to strike them from lesson or two in Facebook school is the DV crowd - you know , the ones who are Deliberately Vague .  The DV will write something like this : " The sky is grey today . Fitting . "  Or : " I 'd love to . But I ca n't . " Or : " Chances are , I 'll be late . "  To which I want to say : Huh ? The DVs are annoyances , it seems to me , and absolute attention getters . They know that no one will understand what they 're saying , and that everyone will ask .  Grow up , DVs . And lastly , I 'd like to take a swipe at the SSPs , since they may be the Facebook folks who are the greatest irritants .  The SSPs are not prone to bragging or to telling you things you 'd rather not hear . They do , however , like to share Syrupy Sweet Postings , invariably with an abundance of hearts , smiley faces and exclamation marks .  " Today is ! ! ! ! ! " the SSP will say .  Um , no . Some folks may think I 'm grumpy , and perhaps that 's what I am .
