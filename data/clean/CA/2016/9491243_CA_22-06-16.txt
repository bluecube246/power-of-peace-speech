<h> Had just about enough of some Facebook users <p> I have been roaming around Facebook for a bit - long enough to observe that some folks should n't be there . <p> You 've seen them - or rather , you 've read their posts . Take the TMI group , or the ones who offer Too Much Information . <p> And I mean way , way too much . <p> They 're the ones who want to tell you every last symptom of the recent flu they had . They 're the ones who want to tell you every sordid detail in their divorce proceedings . They 're the ones who want to tell you about their struggles with the bank account and their dealings with the boss . <p> Please , I want to tell them . Keep it to yourself . <p> Then there 's the RRB gang . Like the TMIs , the RRBs really should be required to take a course in appropriate Facebook behaviour . <p> That 's because they 're Really , Really Boring . <p> " Woke up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower , then breakfast ( eggs and toast , unbuttered ) . Flossed . Now going to do crossword with a coffee at hand . ( Cream , no sugar . ) " Sometimes , the RRBs will upsell their brilliant posts with a photo of said dental floss or coffee cup . <p> Ban them , I say . For life . <p> Equally annoying is the UB pack . Oh , you know them well , my friends . <p> They 're the Ultimate Braggers . <p> The UB will post news - always with a photo album - of little Johnny when he 's ( 1 ) lost his first tooth , ( 2 ) created his first finger painting , or ( 3 ) sat through his first meal without hurling Alphagetti at his sister . <p> The UBs also want the world to know they 're the best of the best at - you name it - photography , cooking , gardening , soap carving or competitive dog grooming . <p> They appear on FB every day , and I 'd like to strike them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson or two in Facebook school is the DV crowd - you know , the ones who are Deliberately Vague . <p> The DV will write something like this : " The sky is grey today . Fitting . " <p> Or : " I 'd love to . But I ca n't . " Or : " Chances are , I 'll be late . " <p> To which I want to say : Huh ? The DVs are annoyances , it seems to me , and absolute attention getters . They know that no one will understand what they 're saying , and that everyone will ask . <p> Grow up , DVs . And lastly , I 'd like to take a swipe at the SSPs , since they may be the Facebook folks who are the greatest irritants . <p> The SSPs are not prone to bragging or to telling you things you 'd rather not hear . They do , however , like to share Syrupy Sweet Postings , invariably with an abundance of hearts , smiley faces and exclamation marks . <p> " Today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! ! ! " the SSP will say . <p> Um , no . Some folks may think I 'm grumpy , and perhaps that 's what I am . <h> Comments <h> NOTE : To post a comment you must have an account with at least one of the following services : Disqus , Facebook , Twitter , Google+ You may then login using your account credentials for that service .
