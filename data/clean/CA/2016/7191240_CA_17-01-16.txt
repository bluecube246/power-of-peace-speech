<p> Brad Marchand 's 16th goal of the season was scored on two separate occasions in last night 's 3-2 victory against the Toronto Maple Leafs . The first occurrence , early in the final frame , saw Patrice Bergeron feed Marchand in front with a beautiful tap-in pass . The call on the ice was challenged by Maple Leafs bench-boss Mike Babcock , and the goal was overturned -- the play ruled offside . It was back to 15 goals on the season for Marchand , although that did n't last long . <p> With 47 seconds remaining in the third period , Marchand picked off a Martin Marincin pass and fired it into a vacated net ; Leafs goaltender Jonathan Bernier , who had played the puck to Marincin behind the net , was caught in-between nowhere and the crease . Which , as you can imagine , is not an ideal for a goalie to be . <p> With 16 goals to his name , Marchand now sits second among Bruins skaters in goals , trailing only Patrice Bergeron . Bergeron , who entered last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening -- opening the scoring just 45 seconds into the game on a breakaway set-up by a Torey Krug outlet pass . Bergeron was credited with the Bruins second goal of the game 39 seconds into the middle frame , deflecting a Zdeno Chara wrister past Bernier . <p> Marchand led Bruins skaters with 6 shots on goal , a category the Bruins dominated 45-29 on the evening . Bergeron and Ryan Spooner each had 5 shots . <p> Kevan Miller , with his assist on the opening goal , now has a three-game point streak ( 1-2-3 ) . <p> Despite Boston 's advantage in shots , Toronto hung around thanks in large part to Bernier 's 42 saves , as well as goals from Leo Komarov and noted Bruins-killer Shawn Matthias . <p> Joe Morrow , in the lineup for the first time since the outdoor game that did n't happen , committed an unforced turnover which led to the Maple Leafs first goal . The 23-year-old settled in as the game wore on and played a relatively solid 13:06 . <p> Zac Rinaldo picked up fighting major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leafs goon Richard Clune in the first period . <p> The Bruins travel to Montreal on Monday in preparation for Tuesday 's clash against the rival Canadiens at Centre Bell . <h> Join Stanley Cup of Chowder <h> Authenticating <h> Great ! <p> Choose an available username to complete sign up . <p> In order to provide our users with a better overall experience , we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience .
