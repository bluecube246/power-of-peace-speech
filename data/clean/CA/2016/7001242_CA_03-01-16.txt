dear justin , senate job please !  governor general david johnston delivers the speech from the throne in the senate chamber on parliament hill in ottawa , on december 4 , 2015 . the conservative-dominated senate is taking the first step towards accommodating prime minister justin trudeau 's desire for a more independent , less partisan upper house . the canadian press/sean kilpatrick  topics  the new government under prime minister justin trudeau apparently wants to end the over-the-top partisanship that has long been a part of the senate .  and under the new plan , individuals can now actually apply to become a senator .  with media jobs disappearing quicker than we can report them , seems like a good idea to hedge my bets !  senator sherring , like the sound of that !  here goes .  dear prime minister justin trudeau ,  i read with interest your desire to bring about change to the senate .  great idea . goodness knows it 's long overdue -- so kudos to you .  please consider this first .  at 56 years of age , i certainly meet the minimum requirement of being 30 years old -- and less than 75 ! i 'm old enough to remember the days of trudeaumania part one ! and now , i 'm again witnessing your honeymoon period .  i 'm a canadian citizen who meets the financial requirements of owning at least $4,000 worth of property .  i note one of the requirements is a " proven record of outstanding ethics and integrity . "  ( that could be a challenge . let 's hope you can find enough qualified candidates to meet that bar ! )  to be clear , as a journalist , i 've spent years following the dollar at ottawa city hall .  i abhor the way some city councillors spend our tax dollars . and i 'm not too crazy about the way many bureaucrats forget how hard we work for our money . between them , seems many simply do n't treat our money as their own -- spending it in on useless communications strategies that do n't , protein shakes and expensive televisions for their offices .  i could go on . how about those frequent lunches where the bill is foisted on us ?  in one case , kanata coun. allan hubley picked up a meal tab which included prime minister stephen harper and then thought it a good idea to get taxpayers to pay for that bill !  saner heads prevailed , and hubley was clearly advised by brighter minds than his to pay the bill himself .  so no , i will never bill the taxpayers for breaking bread with you , my senate colleagues , or any other politician for that matter .  nor will i agree to have another politician pay for my meal if they 're passing the bill on to the taxpayer .  i have strong roots in ottawa , have lived here for all but three years of my life . i was actually born in arnprior , and enjoy bragging about my ottawa valley roots .  that being said , i do live in ottawa and wo n't be attempting to claim the troubles that former journalists pamela wallin and mike duffy have seen , you might be apprehensive of my occupation . but look at the amazing work of the likes of sen. jim munson for proof not all journalists abandon their principles .  it never ceases to amaze me that some get a great gig like the senate , then seem to think it 's their absolute right to claim what appears quite clearly to be personal expenses .  i wo n't take so much as a coffee without returning the favour .  i 've got a proven record of community service -- and recently took that to the electorate -- running for city councillor . and while i failed to convince the voters -- i 'm proud to say i had volunteers of all political stripes lending their name and support to my campaign -- so feel confident i can as the rules require bring a perspective to the senate that is independent and non-partisan .  in fact , i think the world is a better place when not viewed through the lens of party politics country , please count me in that group .
