UFC roundup : Mark Hunt says Brock Lesnar is ' juiced to the gills '  Brock Lesnar is set to return to mixed martial arts at UFC 200 , but one element of the WWE superstar 's comeback is raising some eyebrows .  Typically , fighters must be available to be tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in the four months leading up to a fight as part of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy , which came into effect last July .  However , Lesnar , who announced his comeback on June 4 and is scheduled to fight Mark Hunt on July 9 in Las Vegas , did not have to go through the four-month period . This is because the UFC holds the right to waive the four-month requirement under certain circumstances .  This exemption has resulted in certain people , including Lesnar 's upcoming opponent , questioning whether or not the former heavyweight champion is clean .  " I do n't think that 's fair . I think it 's a load of expletive . I think it 's rubbish do n't think anyone should be exempt from testing . If they 're trying to clean the sport up -- mixed martial arts -- this is a bad way to do it . I do n't care who you are . It 's ridiculous .  " I do n't think it 's a great move . I think he 's juiced to the gills -- and I still think I 'm going to knock him out . So I do n't think that 's correct . I do n't think he should be allowed to get a four-month exemption otherwise everyone else should . Otherwise I should start juicing ... I 've already voiced my opinion to UFC president Dana White about it but apparently Lesnar has been getting tested but he 's probably been off a couple of cycles anyway . "  " It does n't mean you 're not going to get knocked out . Frank Mir was juicing and he got knocked out , " Hunt added . " The same thing 's going to happen with Brock Lesnar . "  Lesnar ( 5-3 ) test during that time . The 38-year-old has n't fought since announcing his retirement from MMA following a loss to Alistair Overeem at UFC 141 .  Canadian stepping up on short notice  Quebec City 's Jonathan Meunier will make his UFC debut in Ottawa . The UFC announced the welterweight has replaced his Tristar Gym teammate Alex Garcia , who is injured , and will fight American Colby Covington at TD Place Arena on June 18 . Meunier , 28 , is 7-0 as a pro with all seven of his wins coming by way of stoppage .  It looks as though Rootstown , Ohio native Jessica Eye could fight in her home state at UFC 203 in Cleveland . The UFC has n't made an official announcement but , according to Brazilian outlet Combate , Eye is set to take on Bethe Correia at the event . Eye ( 11-5 ) has dropped four of her last five and is coming off a unanimous decision loss to Sara McMann in May . Correia ( 8-2 ) , best known for her knockout loss to Ronda Rousey , against Raquel Pennington in April .  Eye 's teammate Stipe Miocic will look to defend his heavyweight title in the main event against Alistair Overeem .  Featherweight barnburner targeted for UFC Salt Lake City  The UFC announced it will hold its first event in Salt Lake City , Utah on Aug. 6 at Vivint Smart Home Arena . No fights have officially been added to the card to date , but according to FloCombat a featherweight bout between rising star Yair Rodriguez and fan favourite Alex " Bruce Leeroy " Caceres is being targeted as the main event .
