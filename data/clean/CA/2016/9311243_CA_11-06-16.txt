ufc roundup : mark hunt says brock lesnar is ' juiced to the gills '  brock lesnar is set to return to mixed martial arts at ufc 200 , but one element of the wwe superstar 's comeback is raising some eyebrows .  typically , fighters must be available to be tested by the united states anti-doping agency in the four months leading up to a fight as part of the ufc anti-doping policy , which came into effect last july .  however , lesnar , who announced his comeback on june 4 and is scheduled to fight mark hunt on july 9 in las vegas , did not have to go through the four-month period . this is because the ufc holds the right to waive the four-month requirement under certain circumstances .  this exemption has resulted in certain people , including lesnar 's upcoming opponent , questioning whether or not the former heavyweight champion is clean .  " i do n't think that 's fair . i think it 's a load of expletive . i think it 's rubbish do n't think anyone should be exempt from testing . if they 're trying to clean the sport up -- mixed martial arts -- this is a bad way to do it . i do n't care who you are . it 's ridiculous .  " i do n't think it 's a great move . i think he 's juiced to the gills -- and i still think i 'm going to knock him out . so i do n't think that 's correct . i do n't think he should be allowed to get a four-month exemption otherwise everyone else should . otherwise i should start juicing ... i 've already voiced my opinion to ufc president dana white about it but apparently lesnar has been getting tested but he 's probably been off a couple of cycles anyway . "  " it does n't mean you 're not going to get knocked out . frank mir was juicing and he got knocked out , " hunt added . " the same thing 's going to happen with brock lesnar . "  lesnar ( 5-3 ) test during that time . the 38-year-old has n't fought since announcing his retirement from mma following a loss to alistair overeem at ufc 141 .  canadian stepping up on short notice  quebec city 's jonathan meunier will make his ufc debut in ottawa . the ufc announced the welterweight has replaced his tristar gym teammate alex garcia , who is injured , and will fight american colby covington at td place arena on june 18 . meunier , 28 , is 7-0 as a pro with all seven of his wins coming by way of stoppage .  it looks as though rootstown , ohio native jessica eye could fight in her home state at ufc 203 in cleveland . the ufc has n't made an official announcement but , according to brazilian outlet combate , eye is set to take on bethe correia at the event . eye ( 11-5 ) has dropped four of her last five and is coming off a unanimous decision loss to sara mcmann in may . correia ( 8-2 ) , best known for her knockout loss to ronda rousey , against raquel pennington in april .  eye 's teammate stipe miocic will look to defend his heavyweight title in the main event against alistair overeem .  featherweight barnburner targeted for ufc salt lake city  the ufc announced it will hold its first event in salt lake city , utah on aug. 6 at vivint smart home arena . no fights have officially been added to the card to date , but according to flocombat a featherweight bout between rising star yair rodriguez and fan favourite alex " bruce leeroy " caceres is being targeted as the main event .  almost done !  please confirm the information below before signing up .  * **32;372;toolong * * **27;406;toolong ** **26;435;toolong ** **30;463;toolong ** **29;495;toolong * by checking this box , i confirm that i have read and understood each of the website terms of service and privacy policy and that i agree to be bound by them .
