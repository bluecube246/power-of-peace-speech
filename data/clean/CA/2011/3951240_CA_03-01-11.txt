"  about nine months after the explosion , trauner walked five kilometres in the army run .  the broken bones in his hands have healed .  he participated in occupational therapy twice a day at the ottawa hospital rehabilitation centre for the nerves and muscles in his hands and to strengthen himself to walk on the prosthetic legs .  while learning how to walk again , trauner raised $70,000 for the ottawa hospital rehabilitation centre in 13 months .  trauner still works with the canadian military at the petawawa base .  if anyone on the base is injured , he will speak to them and guide them .  he travels across the injured soldiers .
