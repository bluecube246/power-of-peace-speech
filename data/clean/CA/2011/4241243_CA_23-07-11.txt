featured photos  many residents of metro vancouver felt shaking late tuesday night , as a moderate earthquake struck near victoria . the quake struck at 11:39 p.m. , about 20 kilometres north of victoria and was felt across much of southern british columbia .  featured video  being prepared will be the key to survival . the tectonic plates off the west coast are squeezing each other with tremendous force . when they break - which is a certainty - they will release a tremendous amount of force resulting in a massive earthquake and inevitable tsunami . people being prepared on the outer coast who may have 20 minutes before the tsunami hits , will be essential to survival .  trial by breathalyzer  mario knezevic 's family arrived from europe to help him celebrate his bravery medals for rescuing and resuscitating a drowned two-year-old .  he did n't expect he would also have to introduce them to b.c. 's new arbitrary , anti-drunk-driving program and its severe , some might even say draconian , punishments .  more importantly , perhaps , feeling of being treated unfairly and far too harshly .  and he is one of many thousands , if anecdotal evidence of lawyers is to be believed .  the b.c. government 's decision to rely on roadside breath tests prohibited by the courts for use as evidence may come back to haunt it -- evoking cynicism from citizens and censure from the court .  police documents obtained exclusively by the sun indicate the devices being used may give false readings and malfunction in many other ways .  the hand-held units were appropriate for their old use -- screening drivers who were then tested on more reliable machines with their charter rights respected .  now drivers are being stripped of their rights and the devices are being used to impose harsh and stigmatizing punishments , raising serious issues of basic fairness , proportionality and constitutional legitimacy .  the whole disturbing issue came into focus for knezevic at the moment he should have been basking in the glow of the community 's recognition of his heroism .  a year ago , knezevic pulled the unconscious girl cpr skills he learned more than a quarter century ago .  " i panicked , but it all came back to me , exactly like i was in the classroom , " he remembered .  " i put her down on the concrete . her mouth was black , not blue , black , i did n't think she would come back . "  she did , with no ill-effects in spite of spending five minutes underwater unconscious , likely clinically dead .  knezevic and his family partied the night away in march of 2011 , when he was awarded the gold medal ( along with a silver ) by the b.c. and yukon lifesaving society for " the most heroic rescue " of the year .  he awoke with a start the next day , about 4:30 p.m. -- friends and kin would soon arrive at his burnaby condo to continue the festivities and he had no liquor .  the 44-year-old , who came to canada in 1991 from croatia , threw on some clothes .  " i jumped in my car to , " he said .  returning home , knezevic was pulled over by an rcmp officer who ultimately asked him to blow into a roadside breathalyzer device .  " i had n't had a drink , " knezevic insisted in an interview , still astounded the mountie told him he failed .  he discounted the idea that he consumed so much the night before , he was still intoxicated -- he felt fine , his eyes were clear , his speech normal , his physical responses steady , and he had slept for seven hours .  " i said , ' no way ! i have n't had a drink -- i just went to get the alcohol . let me do it again . ' "  he did , and again the officer said knezevic failed .  " that 's not possible , " he told the cop . " did n't matter . they impounded my car for a month , gave me a three-month suspension , plus after that , they said i had to install an interlock alcohol detection device that start for one year . "  for knezevic , as for thousands of british columbians caught in the new **25;55;toolong driftnet who believe in the goals of the vaunted strategy , the disillusionment and bad taste left in his mouth were unexpected .  unlike radar guns that are checked before and after each shift , or reliable tabletop breathalyzer units that use an external device to ensure calibration , the hand-held alcosensor iv dwf screeners used in the province are checked and calibrated only once a month .  freedom-of-information requests for calibration and maintenance reports show police forces are using their own record-keeping systems and sometimes dated recalibration forms from 1998 .  there is a paucity of detail in the reports amid suggestions faulty devices may have been used on drivers .  " it 's frightening , " said vancouver lawyer paul doroshenko , who defends impaired-driving cases and made the information requests to learn more about the devices .  " there is little consistency with the way calibration information is recorded from one police department to the next . if you were honestly using more reliable machine , it would be fine . using it in this manner demands far more rigour . "  the devices have been a focus of critics since the new stricter drinking-and-driving regime came into effect last sept. 20 .  on nov. 19 , victoria police chief jamie graham , as chairman of the b.c. association of chiefs of police traffic safety committee , recalled the 2,200 units in use across the province because of an unreasonable margin of error .  the rcmp lab found the units could indicate a reading over .05 when the driver was actually under it . the devices were recalibrated so the " warn " reading now is putatively obtained if the driver blows .06 , recognizing the potential machine error .  regardless , the devices do not give a numeric readout but flash only " warn " or " fail . "  that 's why the rcmp training manual warns officers that results from the units " do not always correspond with those of a subsequent approved instrument test . "  doroshenko said he sought for months -- documents from the province 's 11 municipal departments and rcmp .  in washington state , information about breathalyzer maintenance is available online .  the rcmp , doroshenko said , has dragged its feet providing such data . for instance , detachments have told him to call ottawa or that they do n't feel obligated to release the material because criminal disclosure requirements do n't apply .  the delta police department refused to provide the information , saying in a letter that doing so would " definitely interfere with the operations of our department , specifically assigning a traffic member to spend many hours gathering and producing the data . "  but other forces are complying .  new westminster produced two pages of maintenance records that showed one unit had a major fuel cell leak but little other detail ; the department 's calibration check sheets often did n't record results .  oak bay 's four units all appear to be working , but again they do n't record the results of the calibration tests , so you ca n't see if there is a trend its 12 units .  port moody 's reports reveal a unit " in multiple times for repairs &amp; is still not working ; " another " unit not working ; " a third " will not set when button is depressed ; " another required its battery contacts and temperature sensor resoldered .  here is a sampling of abbotsford 's 27 units :  unit 41149 was over-reporting oct. 28 but has since gone missing ; unit 41150 was permanently removed from service in february because it was over-reporting ; unit 41153 was over-reporting oct. 28 and under-reporting nov. 10 ; unit 56513 over-reporting feb. 26 ; unit 61142 over-reporting on dec. 3 ; unit 85246 would not calibrate on dec. 13 ; unit 85247 was over-reporting feb. 27 ; unit 85249 was over-reporting may 4 ...  units out of calibration may have been giving faulty readings for up to a month . but how often a unit is used each month is unknown because it depends on enforcement patterns .  the records show that aside from the variances recorded from month to month , the devices , damaged mouthpiece retainers , wonky circuit boards and more .  " they are a screening device , " lawyer doroshenko emphasized . " they the police know they are not perfect , they know they make mistakes . now they have been elevated to an evidentiary level and used to punish people harshly based on their results . it 's wrong in my view . "  the devices used to be recalibrated every two weeks but since they were only used to help trigger a criminal investigation , not as evidence , a 30-day period between checks was deemed sufficient .  in a 2005 decision , known as r. v. orbanski , the supreme court of canada said that these kinds of roadside checks , during which a driver is detained and unable to exercise his or her right to counsel , are only allowed under the charter if the information obtained is not used against the motorist .  the results of roadside vetting for alcohol consumption can not be used as evidence to incriminate the driver on a criminal charge , only to establish reasonable  a ruling in b.c. supreme court in 2009 , r. v. shultz , confirmed that orbanski similarly applied to the motor vehicle act , the provincial law under which the new regime is authorized .  civil libertarians argue victoria is using legislative sleight-of-hand to make the court rulings and drivers ' charter rights seemingly vanish .  with changes to the motor vehicle act , the province also is imposing stiffer-than-criminal punishment and transgressing on federal jurisdiction .  " it 's quite a disturbing piece of legislation , " says doroshenko , who has many clients upset at what happened to them . " i 'm shocked by it . "  victoria defends its approach and disagrees with opponents of the law , but wo n't comment because the issue is before the courts . similarly , lawyers behind the constitutional challenge are reticent .  a criminal conviction for impaired driving or blowing over .08 on a reliable breathalyzer carries a punishment that on average amounts to a $1,000 fine , a record and a one-year driving prohibition .  in b.c. you must also take reinstated , it restricts you from operating any vehicle that does not have an interlock .  getting to that point is expensive and , because the full panoply of charter rights is in play , time consuming -- it usually takes over a year unless there is a guilty plea .  under the new system , you get an immediate three-month driving prohibition , a year 's driving restriction with the interlock , have to take the course and pay nearly $5,000 in fees and fines -- with no legal rights .  this approach was intended as a solution to the spiralling costs associated with the thousands of drunk-driving charges that clot the legal system -- judges , prosecutors and police salaries , etc. -- and to generate money .  the framers of this scheme thought as many as 13,000 drivers a year would be captured . it could be double that given the numbers generated in the first six months .  this is all via a process that takes 20 minutes compared to the four days it reportedly costs in police time for each drinking-and-driving provincial government consciously embarked on this path . it was discussed in the legislature .  the b.c. liberals and the ndp both support it -- this is not a partisan issue .  potential court challenges were raised and considered . as a result , the law was deliberately crafted in an attempt to skirt constitutional landmines .  first , last july , without fanfare the government changed the duties of police officers under the motor vehicle act .  they were no longer required to provide sworn information , for instance .  the old administrative driving prohibition regime approved by the courts did not allow that and there are other significant differences .  it 's understandable the government did this . there 's a serious problem with drinking driving and no one has come up with a good solution so far .  there is enormous pressure from special interest groups and a public outcry over the continuing carnage . and this big stick seems to be working -- deaths reputedly fell to 30 from the five-year average of 61 during the first six months the are being pulled over putatively for the criminal offence of drinking driving , but they are no longer being dealt with criminally and are losing their rights .  the goals are worthy , but has the government found the right solution to drinking drivers and implemented it in a constitutionally correct manner ? should the punishment be this stiff , bearing in mind the devices are not checked daily , were not intended for this purpose and can have major problems that the officer at the roadside may not notice ?  b.c. supreme court justice jon sigurdson is deliberating about all of this and more in a challenge to the law . his ruling is expected by fall .  meanwhile , a month before his prohibition expired , knezevic called to have an interlock installed on his luxury audi a8l .  for the next month , he bounced between garages -- two in vancouver , two in richmond -- vainly trying to have the device put in his car . no one was able to do it .  he called motor vehicles and told them no they said , " sir , you have to sell or downgrade your vehicle . "  " i did n't have a choice , " he complained , still irked .  " i sold the car . i lost $22,000 on it . then i have to buy another car and i ca n't get a high-end diesel one because they 're not sure they can put it in that either . i do n't want to buy a piece of junk , so i got a gti golf , brand new $41,000 . that took another month without a driver 's licence . it was like being in jail . "  today , knezevic drives his interlock-equipped vw and ca n't wait for his year-long restriction to expire and to lose the embarrassing device .  he asked icbc to give him a month 's credit for the four weeks beyond his initial 90-day prohibition it took him to sell his car , buy a new one and have his licence reinstated .  they told him too bad : it was a one-year restriction from the n't believe there was residual alcohol in his system : it was a flaw in the device :  " seven hours ? i slept seven hours . "  the small businessman , who runs his own maintenance and construction company , thinks the device was wrong and that he should have been able to question its functioning , at least to see what he blew , or have some rights of appeal .  " i spent $500 for a lawyer and he told me there was nothing could be done -- you ca n't win an appeal , " knezevic said ,  he was told the law permits only a handful of defences : you were n't in control of a vehicle , the test did n't indicate a fail or warn , you did n't refuse to blow or had a reasonable excuse for not blowing or failing .  " it 's unfair . . . . and they did n't give me credit for that month and they forced me to sell my car , i lost money and they forced me to buy n't drinking -- the mountie could see i was totally normal .
