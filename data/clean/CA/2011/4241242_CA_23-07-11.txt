" 100% of the shots you do n't take do n't go in. " -- wayne gretzky , famous edmonton oiler  * * * first things first : the " bomb " in the headline is a my-generation bomb , not the twisted new phrase . oilers ' powerplay is not " the bomb " , it just bombs . repeatedly . perennially . set the timer at two minutes and watch it wind inexorably down to zero . boom , blow up the powerplay .  fans of the oilers do n't really need any math to tell us our powerplay stinks , but the numbers can illuminate where the problems lie . last time we analyzed how the oilers ' not-so-special team performed in 2010-11 , which is to say , not well . here 's a condensed recap of just the top and bottom teams , featuring shots on goal per hour as the measuring stick .  we found the oilers had fired by far the fewest shots per hour of powerplay time of any nhl team , way behind everybody else percentage was enough to lift them to just 27th in the all-important category of goal production . terrible + mediocre = lousy .  i figured , no souray , hemsky injured , whitney injured , too many rookies , and was that really kelly buchberger calling the shots ( or lack thereof ) ? inquisitive son of a gun that i am , i figured let 's compare coach renney 's rancid results to those of his predecessor , pat quinn . surely the oiler fared better in 2009-10 ?  what do you know , there are oilers in 30th spot for shots on goal again . shooting percentage was pretty darn good , sixth in the nhl , but still only 19th in overall goal production . nowhere near enough shots , seven per hour below the nhl norm . terrible + good = below average . i do n't like how this is going .  but surely 2008-09 , the last year of craig mactavish 's reign at the helm , would yield different results . after all , the other two clubs were legitimately last-place bunch of statistical categories . mact 's last team finished a quasi-respectable 21st in the standings . how about that powerplay ?  ok , so much for that theory . last in the league in pp shots with a bullet , more than eight below the league average . again a respectable shooting percentage ( 11th in the league ) meant the goal production was a little better , but 22nd overall is not going to win you anything , now is it ? terrible + decent = poor .  determined to find an efficient powerplay somewhere in living memory , i rolled back the statistical calendar at nhl.com another year . 2007-08 was nearly a magical season , at least there were some big games after the new year , and the team made a late but unsuccessful run at the playoffs . the powerplay was a big part of that , was n't it ?  well , sort of . that 15+ % finishing ability ranked third in the whole league , but that was based on far too few shots , ten below the league goals per hour . terrible + excellent = poor . got ta do something about that " terrible " side of the equation , it reminds me of multiplying by zero . it never ends well .  ( note that in 2007-08 and previous years , the league does n't split out time by manpower situation , so i was unable to make the adjustment for 5-on-3 time described last time . gross minutes are all we have moving on back . )  sigh . let 's turn another page to 2006-07 , when ryan smyth last graced oilers ' powerplay , at least for ? of the season before his tearful departure from the river city .  well , what do you know . the shots rate is still horrible at under 40 per hour , but at least we have company in such laughingstocks as chicago blackhawks ( who were on their way to a draft lottery win ) . oddly , even though the oil were all the way up in 28th for shot production and their shooting percentage was middling at 17th in the , its worst such ranking in the five years we 've looked at to this point . terrible + mediocre = lousy , take two .  one has to go back to 2005-06 to find an oiler team that could hold its own and even do some damage with the man advantage . no table for this one as the oil would be in that big gap in the middle , in fact a little above the middle . led by one of hockey 's top powerplay quarterbacks in chris pronger , the finals-bound oilers were in the top half of the league across the board -- 13th in shots per hour , 12th in shooting percentage , 11th in goals per hour . good + good = playoffs . funny , that .  but to look at the five years since then is to see a sorry , sordid mess . let 's recap for the whole league for that half-decade , adding a couple of columns for actual powerplay shots and goals :  one pattern worth mentioning from the league-wide perspective is how the number of 2005-06 , in the frenzy of whistles that was " the new nhl " , the typical team had 738 minutes with the man advantage , but in subsequent years that value dropped to 663 to 570 to 568 to 508 to 490 ( and those latter three totals have been adjusted upwards ! ) . from twelve hours year to eight , with no sign of a levelling off . special teams will always be important of course , but they 're becoming less so by the year .  turning back to the edmonton perspective , the above is pretty much what you 'd expect given what we 've learned so far : last with a bullet in shots , over three per hour below the next worst team and over eight off the league average . the squad was 15th in powerplay ice time , smack dab in the middle , but a distant last in gross shots , more than 100 behind second worst and nearly 400 below the league average . that is gross . far too big a deficit to overcome even with above-average shooting number was enough to pull the oilers up to just 28th in ppg/60 , and tied for 27th in total pp goals . while there is enough jitter in the data to question the crude equation more shots = more goals , there is excellent evidence to support the corollary no shots = no goals , the famous gretzky theory cited up top .  five years , three different coaches , one persistent pattern . over those years , the list of team leaders in powerplay goals has dustin penner leading the way with a relatively modest 33 ; beyond him , shawn horcoff ranked outside the league 's top 100 with his 28 snipes , and ales hemsky outside the top 150 with just 21 . sheldon souray had 12 one glorious season , but just two in the rest of his oiler career . ryan smyth 's 14 powerplay goals in just 53 games in ' 06-07 stands as the best single season for any oiler in that span . in the last two years with hemsky battling injury , nobody has even reached double digits . it one could point to the signature combination of decently high-percentage shots but nowhere near enough of them and conclude " ales hemsky " . on the other , a doubting thomas might note that four years into sam gagner 's nhl career , his team 's powerplay has had the worst shot production in the league every single year . ( the chance of that happening randomly is , after all , just one in 810,000 ( =304 ) ) . on both hands together , there are almost enough fingers to point at other culpable parties , from sheldon souray 's erratic play and health to shawn horcoff 's whiffs to the failure of anybody in the lupul-cole-o'sullivan chain to hit his weight in powerplay goals . then there has been the seeming failure of head coaches and special teams coaches to come up with a working alternative to the studly wonderbomb strategy , and the desultory record of management who could n't convince pronger or smyth to stick around or find replacements who could deliver at their high level .  beneath even that has been the persistent cruelty injury who has been looking askance at edmonton for pretty much the whole time under review here . at any point it seemed the team would be down at least two of its major powerplayers . hemsky , horcoff , gagner , souray , visnovsky , whitney . multiple injuries , most of those guys . serious injuries , season-enders . even flexible kids like eberle and hall were n't immune to evil twists of fate .  i 'm sure the oilers now have the firepower to work their way out of the paper bag eventually , but when ? conventional wisdom suggests the reclaimed smytty is too old , the kids too young , the prime-timers too fragile . youth will be served , but it takes time to learn the tricks of the nhl trade . hall , eberle , and paajarvi showed their chops at times last year , and their inexperience at other times . i 'm pretty confident the latter will disappear first . linus omark looked like the next hemsky at times on the powerplay , and at other times he looked even better . then of course there 's the current hemsky , purportedly healthier than he has been in minutes and surely chomping at the bit thinking of all those hungry young mouths to feed . ditto for ryan whitney who has driven some decent pp results in his all-too-brief time as an oiler .  the wild card comes in the slender form of the latest whiz kid . ryan nugent-hopkins was brilliant on the powerplay in junior , excelling on both points , the half wall , and the " traditional " centre post . the polished pivot 's pp proclivities potentially pave his path to the pros . how well , and how quickly , those skills translate against the best penalty killers and goalies in the world is an unknown until we actually see them all on the same ice . at first i 'm expecting to see healthy doses of both chops and inexperience . in the longer term i 'm pretty confident he 's a big part of the solution , but that may not happen in ' 11-12 .  all this impatient oiler fan knows have been excruciating , and the so-called " man advantage " has only added to our pain .  comments  we encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts . we are committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion , so we ask you to avoid personal attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful . if you encounter a comment that is abusive , click the " x " in the upper right corner of the comment box to report spam or abuse . we are using facebook commenting . visit our faq page for more information .
