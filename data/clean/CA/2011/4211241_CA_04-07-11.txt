Prisoners of the world, unite!

<p> In January 2010 , a 50-something inmate serving a life sentence at Mountain Institution , a medium-security prison in Agassiz , British Columbia , polled his fellow prisoners to see if they were in favour of starting a labour union . Over 76 per cent of the inmates said yes . By March , he and a core group of 14 inmates at Mountain had drafted a constitution for the union and have been working towards certification ever since . If the inmates are successful , the union will be the first of its kind in the country . <p> It 's not surprising the movement is happening at Mountain , given its unique status as a work-focused prison where inmates must have steady jobs . As of 2007 , there were 449 inmates at Mountain -- the majority of whom work in one of four industries : textiles , manufacturing , construction , and prison services , such as printing and laundry . They 've only recently met their first hurdle : getting 51 per cent of the prisoners to sign up . This is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , where inmates have been denied the right to assemble . <p> In a press release , the prisoners said their proposed union would raise issues that " plague the prison population as a workforce , " including workplace safety , access to vocational training , and pay , which has n't been adjusted to inflation since 1986 . The union tactic comes in response to a dysfunctional inmate grievance system that is overloaded , understaffed , and inefficient . According to the Correctional Investigator 's office the volume of complaints has grown from around 20,000 in 2005-06 to over 28,000 in 2009-2010 <p> A 2010 review of the complaints and grievance process by David Mullan , a constitutional lawyer and professor emeritus at Queen 's University , found " serious problems " with the current system . A routine grievance can take over 150 days from its initial filing to be resolved , in part because of improperly trained staff . ( Mullan says staff do " little more than process paper . " ) And the system is tied up by " frequent users " -- serial grievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mullan found that in some institutions , just a dozen offenders accounted for 11.3 per cent of all submissions . <p> Canada 's prisoners ' rights movement dates back to the 70s , when a series of brutal uprisings and violent deaths spurred an overhaul of prison legislation , including extending the vote behind prison walls . Since then , a series of legal reforms that have guaranteed rights to prisoners , notably the adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982 and the adoption of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act in 1992 , which includes the inmate grievance policy . In many respects , Canada 's commitment to prisoner 's rights is admirable . <p> But just because something is written , does n't mean it 's enforced , cautions Allan Manson , a criminal law professor at Queen 's University . " The problem , " says Manson , " is enforcing compliance with the act and that continues to be a problem today . " There are statutory standards , he says , " but prisoners have to be able to force compliance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litigation , there has n't been a crucial mass of judicial scrutiny that will keep penitentiary officials in line . " <p> The Correctional Service of Canada would n't speculate on the impact a union might have on the federal prison system and pointed out that inmates already have a say in their treatment . " Each institution has an inmate committee which is formed to allow inmates to identify issues , including work-related issues , affecting them and to raise them with wardens and institutional staff , " CSC spokesperson Jean-Paul Lorieau wrote in an email to Maclean 's . " So far no union has been formed , and we do not have any further comments on this issue . " <p> In the meantime , Mountain inmates and Natalie Dunbar , a Vancouver-based criminal lawyer who 's been serving as a liaison between the prison and the outside world , continue to organize . While the process is slow , Dunbar is optimistic . She says a prisoners ' union could " change the dynamic " between guards and prisoners for the better . " Prison staff are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believe it or not some of the issues intersect with prisoners issues . " Ideally , Dunbar says prison labour unions will propagate across the country : " Mountain would be local 001 and hopefully Kent would be unionized , then places throughout BC and then Canada . " Though , until then , " it 's baby steps , " she says . " We just want to get the application in at Mountain .

Outside the walls they would have no free vocational training , no immediate right to be checked by a doctor without a wait of hours to weeks , no mandated nutrition etc etc etc . Prisons are not supposed to be nice places , that 's supposed to be part of the deterrent of lawful confinement . <p> One of the best features of a prison workout regimen is that it can be followed in virtually any environment . If you think about it , prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used and what ca n't , so with this routine there are no acceptable excuses .
