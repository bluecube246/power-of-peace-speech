<h> Apparently the Mastercard Centre for Hockey Excellence is a financial sinkhole <p> Hockey seems to be the topic of the day . First , the Vancouver Canucks get thumped by the Boston Bruins in game six of the Stanley Cup Finals last night . Then , early this afternoon , city council 's economic development committee put forward a request for Rob Ford to write a letter to the NHL commissioner expressing the city 's interest in a second NHL team ( it seems the request was summarily shut down ) . And last but not least , news broke that the city is embroiled in a financial snafu concerning a four-pad ice hockey rink in Etobicoke . <p> The latest boondoggle to hit the City Hall radar concerns the $43.4-million Lakeshore Lions Arena , better known as the Mastercard Centre for Hockey Excellence . <p> The operators of the nearly two-year-old , four-pad complex on Kipling Ave . took on so much debt to build the centre , they are no longer able to cover their debt servicing costs and poised to default on their loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , at last count city hall had given the Lakeshore Lions $35.5 million in capital loan guarantees , making for a total debt of $43.4 million for the entire project . So , basically , the city guaranteed a loan for a bunch of investors who , apparently , had a hard time keeping to a budget and now ca n't meet the loan payments . And while the Toronto Sun puts the blame on the old David Miller regime , they also note that every councillor save for Mike Del Grande -- including the now mayor -- voted for this deal . <p> We ca n't help but notice that the city is also in for an expensive , multi-storey four-pad ice rink slated for the Lower Donlands as part of Waterfront Toronto 's redevelopment of the area . This deal is even sketchier than the Etobicoke one , as the city does n't have the money for the full project . But , hey , at least the arena-funding mess in Toronto is n't doing the same thing to council that the arena-funding mess in Quebec City is @ @ @ @ @ @
