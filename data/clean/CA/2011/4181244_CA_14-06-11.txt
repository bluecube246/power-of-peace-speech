first arrests in ocean lady human smuggling investigation  toronto -- the four suspected organizers of a human smuggling ship that brought dozens of sri lankan migrants to canada 's west coast in 2009 were arrested by rcmp officers in toronto on tuesday . the captains , chief engineer and assistant engineer of the mv ocean lady were charged with " organizing entry into canada " and will be transported back to vancouver this week to appear before a judge .  " these individuals are alleged to be involved with organizing the overall venture and being active leaders on the vessel , " superintendent tom jones , head of the rcmp border integrity program in b.c. , told reporters .  the arrests are the first to result from several ongoing rcmp investigations into southeast asia-based human smugglers who have ferried hundreds of sri lankan refugee claimants to canada aboard two freighters .  they were arrested without incident after they were told to report to the greater toronto canada border services agency office on tuesday morning . if convicted , the cbsa could attempt to a news conference , supt. jones declined to elaborate on what roles the men had allegedly played on the ship , but a classified document obtained by the national post describes them as the operators of the vessel .  the public prosecution service of canada memo says mr. thevarajah , mr. appulonappa and mr. handasamy were found in the ship 's wheelhouse when it was boarded by rcmp officers . several migrants also identified them as the bosses of the ship during interviews with rcmp and cbsa officers , it adds .  anyone convicted of helping more than ten undocumented migrants enter canada faces up to life imprisonment and a $1-million fine under section 17.1 of the immigration and refugee protection act .  immigration minister jason kenney told reporters in ottawa following the arrests that canada was open to asylum seekers but that paying a smuggling operation was " the worst and most dangerous way of coming to canada . "  public safety minister vic toews called human smuggling a " despicable crime " that takes advantage of underprivileged and desperate people . he said the conservatives .  asked why the bill was a priority , mr. toews said canada needed to be prepared because it was being targeted by human smugglers . " we want to be able to say to canadians we have done everything that we can in order to ensure that the appropriate legislative framework is in place . "  formerly the princess easwary , the ocean lady left indonesia in late july 2009 . after a stop in thailand to pick up more passengers , and a second stop near the philippines to deal with money problems , it crossed the pacific , arriving off vancouver island on oct. 17 .  all 76 men on board made refugee claims and were released by the immigration and refugee board . almost all have since moved to toronto , home to one of the world 's largest ethnic tamil populations .  the ship 's passengers and crew have said they were fleeing persecution in sri lanka , where the ethnic tamil minority has long complained of discrimination under a government dominated by ethnic sinhalese . a brutal civil war between tamil since the ocean lady reached canadian waters , an rcmp investigation called project e-panurgic has been probing a dozen of those on board who were suspected of involvement in the smuggling operation .  the investigation was lengthy and plagued by problems , from a shortage of tamil-language translators to troubles matching evidence found on the ship to specific migrants . a gps device found on the ship contained no useful data .  the rcmp first sent its case to the prosecutors in vancouver last october , recommending charges against a dozen of the migrants . but rather than approving the charges , the crown responded with a scathing critique of the investigation .  the crown wrote that rcmp interviews were " poorly done , " seized documents were not translated and that the analysis of evidence was " rudimentary . " the memo pointed to page after page of " problems , " " deficiencies " and " areas which require improvement before a prosecution can proceed . "  the mounties responded that some of the points raised by prosecutors were inaccurate or unfair , but other investigation that ultimately led to the four arrests .  according to the crown memo , mr. thevarajah was " in control of the vessel . " witnesses said he was in charge of the engine room and gave orders on the ship . he also allegedly told five of the migrants to deposit their payments in a bank account . while most of the migrants stayed below deck , he allegedly slept by himself in a cabin .  mr. appulonappa was photographed while in the wheelhouse by a passing plane . like the other two , he lived in a cabin . one of the migrants said he " supervised the engine room . " another said mr. appulonappa had spoken to about 20 of the migrants at an apartment before they boarded the ship , telling them not to talk about the tamil tigers rebels .  a migrant considered a key witness in the case told police mr. appulonappa had brought 15 or 16 of the passengers above deck " to tell them they owed money for trip , " the memo says . the migrant said had absconded with their payments . the organizers wanted them to pay another $10,000 or said they or their families would be killed , the memo says .  mr. handasamy also allegedly lived in a cabin on the upper deck , where he worked in the bridge and steered the ship . migrants staying in the ship 's hold allegedly had to ask for his permission before they could come up onto the deck .  police believe he " played a role in smuggling the migrants to canada , " the memo says . one of the migrants told police mr. handasamy picked him up at the airport in indonesia and brought him to a small boat that ferried him out to the ship .  a shipping agent in the philippines also identified him from a photo line up as the captain of the ship . a passing aircraft also photographed him in the wheelhouse during the voyage . he and mr. thevarajah were the " main people in charge , " a migrant told police .  crown prosecutors have decided to proceed with direct indictments , to trial . this can take place with the approval of the attorney general when there has been a significant delay in bringing a matter to trial , where witnesses are in danger or to ensure public confidence .  ten months after the ocean lady reached canada , a second ship called the mv sun sea made a similar voyage carrying 492 sri lankans who had boarded in southern thailand . the same smugglers are suspected of involvement in both ships as well as a third that was disrupted by police last fall and another that police believe is still being organized .
