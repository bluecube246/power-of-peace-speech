the impact of labour disputes vs. real threats to economic recovery  now that the mail is being delivered again , canada 's economic prospects have brightened considerably . that is , if you believe the harper government 's claims that the phony shutdown of canada post by its own management constituted a real and present danger to the national recovery .  the government justified the drama with the need to protect the recovery . never mind that management 's argument for cutting wages and restructuring pensions was precisely that the post office 's importance was in historic decline . it seems that management and government alike are allowed to argue that the post office is either really important or not very important at all . ( the same double-speak applied to the air canada strike . )  i do n't know any economists who were losing sleep over the impact of either work stoppage on the national gdp . but many are increasingly preoccupied with several bigger threats that could undo the fragile recovery .  the government has indicated its willingness to interfere contractual outcomes , in the interests of preserving canada 's economic momentum . that opens up a lot of terrain for shepherding our recovery . so let 's assign ottawa 's control freaks to some truly important economic protection work .  gasoline prices : even at $1.25 a litre , gas prices will rip $40-billion from the pockets of canadians this year . the soaring prices are a big reason why consumer spending has stopped in its tracks -- an alarming development that could precipitate a recession . and you ca n't invoke " market forces " to explain the prices . they 've been driven up by speculation , fat oil industry profits and opec 's continuing power .  interest rates : the bank of canada is holding its prime rate at a historically low level . but the gap between that rate ( which chartered banks pay on their own borrowing ) and what banks charge their own customers has widened substantially . spreads on credit cards and small business loans are even wider . no wonder the big six banks made $20-billion in profit last year is stuck in its tracks .  the loonie : according to the oecd , the fair value of our dollar ( based on purchasing power ) is 81 cents ( us ) . currency traders have pushed it 25 per cent higher , jeopardizing canada 's ability to sell anything ( other than oil ) to world markets . again , savings on imports are n't passed on to consumers . but the pain to our export industries and the threat to our future growth are real .  all these issues reflect contractual dealings between private parties that are jeopardizing economic growth . all reflect the working of power and policy , not the " pure " forces of supply and demand . and all are amenable to myriad forms of government intervention to attain better prices in the interest of continued recovery .  why is the government , so quick to intervene to suppress compensation for the humble folks who deliver our mail , standing on the sidelines while powerful people enrich themselves at the expense of our national prosperity ? perhaps it 's not the economy is an economist with caw . this article was first published in theglobe and mail .
