<p> A long and distinguished career comes to an end next week as P.E.I. Fire Marshal Dave Blacquiere retires ending a 46-year run in the fire fighting service . <p> Blacquiere has been P.E.I. 's fire marshal for the past 20 years and prior to that served as a firefighter for 26 years . <p> In his time as fire marshal , Blacquiere has experienced the highs and the lows of the firefighting life . <p> Blacquiere noted two very special events that came about during his years in the fire service . The first was the $3,000 tax break for volunteer firefighters , an issue he was involved in promoting since he became fire marshal . <p> " I started asking for that in 1992 or early in 1993 , " he said . " There was a firefighter in Charlottetown by the name of Johnny Squarebriggs and he was on the Charlottetown city council and I asked Johnny because I was very disappointed that there was a tax break for firefighters , but you had to be earning significant money as a firefighter in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canadian Municipalities meeting and it was brought up at that time . So , it 's taken from 1993 to 2011 , and believe me I was hammering on the doors for that for years . So am I pleased ? I 'm really pleased . " <p> Another was being involved with getting community care facilities serviced by sprinkler systems . P.E.I. was the first province to do this . Other provinces across the country have followed P.E.I. 's lead . <p> " Like anybody who leaves their job there is a list of things you wish you could have done or could have done better , but you 've got to accept you ca n't do everything " he said . " One of the things that I 'm very pleased and proud of is that we were able to get all our community care facilities agreeing to sprinkler their places . Since we 've done that other provinces have picked up on that . That makes me feel rather good because it is one segment of our society that is extremely vulnerable in fire situations , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with fire services also brings some devastating moments . <p> " There are a number of them that come to mind , " he said . " There was one where two young children perished and the mother was outside the house believing she had her child in her arms and all it was a blanket . She was in complete shock . I remember leaving that fire after investigating it and having to stop 20 miles down the road and have a good cry because all that was flashing back to me was my young family and thinking for just the luck of God it 's not my family . " <p> Blacquiere said fires take their toll on firefighters . <p> " You just ca n't go to them and see the pain and suffering these people are going through and not feel it yourself , " he said . <p> For his replacement , Blacquiere had some advice . <p> " The best advice I could give is to appreciate that he 's now in a position that he can help people , that he constantly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fire situations and just keep people informed , " he said . " You 're in that position because there 's belief that you understand what 's required and help the people , deal with the people . Sit down listen to the people and be out there for them constantly . " <p> After 46 years on the job Blacquiere intends to " do a little traveling " and " play a lot of golf . " <p> " No doubt I 'll miss it , " Blacquiere said Friday . " But I have every belief that I 'm going to enjoy retirement . " <p> But he did hint that after a short break he will be available to help out fire services if the need him . <h> Recent comments <p> We can hope his replacement is as decent as he was . I worry that what is to come will be an arrogant person who spent too much time at the trough . People who are truly intelligent do n't need to be bullies . Please pick a smart one to represent all firefighters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever had . You deserve a joyful retirement . Now it 's really time to " Spray Down and Cool Off " . God Bless you Dave as you carry on and enjoy what you truly deserve ............ PEACE <p> 46 years of dedication , loyalty and sheer determination to help others in the manner that he knew best , through his own personal sacrifice . Serving proudly in the Royal Canadian Air Force , earnestly representing the fire fighting community of PEI , spearheading countless endeavours that have had profound affect on our world and how we care for those in it , David Blacquiere , in my mind , is the epitome of what is right in this world ! I consider myself the luckiest man in the world because I am one of only two people who have the right to call this wonderful man DAD ! Congratulations on your retirement dad , thank you for everything you do for me and the world around me !
