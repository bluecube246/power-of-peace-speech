Stamps' switch hitter

<p> When the Edmonton Eskimos visited McMahon Stadium twice last year , it was painful for Tim St. Pierre . <p> As a linebacker/long-snapper for the Eskimos , St. Pierre was part of a team on the losing end of 56-15 and 52-5 beatings . <p> This year , St. Pierre is expecting a much different outing for himself - and not just because he 's with the Calgary Stampeders . <p> In his first meeting against his former team , St. Pierre is taking over as the starting fullback for the Stamps . <p> And with the Eskimos at 3-0 facing the 2-1 Stamps , there should n't be a lopsided blowout between the West Division rivals . <p> St. Pierre had never taken a pounding like that in any level of football . <p> " I was on the winning side in college , " the 25-year-old said . " That was much more fun . Being on the losing side is terrible . <p> " I 'm looking forward to being on the good side of the fans here this year and on this side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre right after free-agency opened in February and told him immediately they would like to move him over to offence . <p> He was drafted as a linebacker and spent last season as the full-time long-snapper for the Eskimos . <p> It 's a tough transition going from hitting to blocking , but Stamps offensive co-ordinator Dave Dickenson likes what he 's seen in St. Pierre and is confident he can replace Rob Cote , who is out with a knee injury . <p> " It 's gone amazingly well , " Dickenson said about the experiment . " We 've tried that in the past and sometimes it 's been OK for the guy , but most of the time it 's something they are n't used to . <p> " I do believe Tim is a quick learner , and he 's at least played the game and understands it . I feel confident he will do the right thing and give me everything he 's got . " <p> Cote was hurt fairly early in the win last Thursday over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers , and St. Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled out for a pass and showed some sure hands in catching the ball . <p> Dickenson is impressed with his catching ability , which might be aided by handling the ball for snapping . <p> " Originally , I was n't too sure , " Dickenson said . " I called a play for him on the short yardage and he responded great . <p> " He 's caught the ball well in practice . If you have confidence in someone during practice , then it confirms you can call the play during the game . He showed he can do it . " <p> A year ago , the Stamps tried moving Mike Cornell to fullback from linebacker , but Cornell is now back playing his natural position for the Eskimos . <p> St. Pierre took to the change with excitement . <p> " A lot of people have asked me about the position change , but once you go through a CFL training camp , three or four weeks of that , it 's equivalent to three years in college in terms of knowledge you get , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and veterans around you , so you can pick it up quick . That 's what I 've been able to do . "
