it 's common to use facebook as a scapegoat for poor academic performance . that 's because a few small studies have shown that grades are lower among students who spend more time on the social media site . the assumption has always been that more time spent on facebook translates to less time spent studying , which leads to lower grades .  but a newer , bigger u.s. study has found that facebook time and study time are only weakly related . it takes many extra hours of posting and chatting before grades start to slip . what 's more , although the new study found negative relationships between grades and certain types of facebook activities , other types of activities appear to be a associated with higher grades .  study participants were given a long list of potential facebook activities , including tagging photos , updating their own statuses , creeping on other people 's pages , chatting , linking and more . students rated how often they do each activity . they were also asked how much time they spend studying and the results show that sharing links and checking out what friends are up to ( also known as creeping ) are related to higher gpas , while obsessively posting one 's own status , using the chat function and logging-on more often are related to lower gpas .  and while more time spent on facebook in general is correlated with less time spent preparing for class , the relationship is weak . the study 's model found that a student who spent four hours and 40 minutes more than the average student on facebook in a week would only spend an hour and forty minutes less than the average student studying that week .  " facebook use in and of itself is not detrimental to academic outcome , " researcher reynol junco of lock haven university of pennsylvania told mashable . " it depends how it 's used . "  to understand why there 's so much interest in how facebook may effect grades , consider how much time students in the study report spending on the site -- on average 106 minutes daily .  the authors as the sample size is large ( n=1,839 ) and they controlled for intelligence by using high school grades , in addition to gender , ethnicity and socioeconomic status . the study was published in computers in human behavior .  filed under :  advertisement  about this author  josh dehaas is a writer and editor focused on post-secondary education and training . he has a master of journalism from the university of british columbia and a bachelor of arts from the university of guelph .  notice : your email may not yet have been verified . please check your email , click the link to verify your address , and then submit your comment . if you ca n't find this email , access your profile editor to re-send the confirmation email . you must have a verified email to submit a comment . once you have done so , check again .  sign in / sign up  with your existing account from  with an email account  commenters who signed up before june 26th , 2014 will have to reregister on our new process should only take a few minutes , and you 're welcome to use the same email address .  almost done !  please confirm the information below before signing up .  * #socialregistrationform * * **27;428;toolong * * **26;457;toolong * * **30;485;toolong * * **29;517;toolong * by clicking " create account " , i confirm that i have read and understood each of the website terms of service and privacy policy and that i agree to be bound by them .
