blink , and it was gone . the foodist market , which itself had replaced the ill-fated juice bar pulp kitchen , opened and closed quicker than its detractors could mutter , " expired earthbound organic mixed greens ? ! " we hope eadrey hemmings has more staying power . since 2004 , the jamaican expat has been whipping up her small-batch homemade hot sauces , marinades and rubs for other retailers . now they share the folksy white shelves of eadrey foods , her soon-to-open queen east shop , with jamaican blue mountain coffee and other local and international goodies . the space is homey , in shades of chocolate brown and white , with a colourful painting of lush , red poppies on the walls . hemmings is n't a trained chef , but she has worked in kitchens since she was 15 . expect the display cooler to be brimming with grab-and-go sandwiches -- made with breads from st. john 's bakery -- savoury pot pies , salads and roti . but not just any roti -- eadrey 's own jerk chicken roti with ? ting , of course .  ( image : signe langford )  across the street from eadrey 's is a sign bearing three auspicious little words : " food , liquor , oysters . " nikki andriet and dean fletcher , co-owners of the comrade , are branching out -- albeit not too far from the tree -- with goods and provisions , a new bistro and bar . antique fair finds and salvaged treasures fill the charming 30-seat space , including original signage from the big bop , shabby-chic furniture , time-battered photographs of nameless , long-dead soldiers in uniform and a stunning marble bar . the menu , by 37-year-old chef keith hosein , promises to be as eccentric as the room . born in trinidad and raised in winnipeg , hosein has cooked his way up and down the west coast in seattle , vancouver and california , but has spent the last three years honing his skills in toronto , lately at table 17 . and though the owners are remaining tight-lipped , we can say that in addition to the aforementioned oysters , there with idiosyncratic twists courtesy of their time spent travelling throughout asia and their shared love of street food . fletcher says , " we just want the place to be fun and the food to be amazing . it 's just a neighbourhood place ... we plan to under-promise and over-deliver !
