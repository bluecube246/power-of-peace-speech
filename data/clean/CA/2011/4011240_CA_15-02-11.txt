<p> I 'm a 35-year-old female and have noticed some sudden and , what I perceive to be , severe hair loss . <p> I think I 'm losing 200 to 300 hairs a day at least from all over my scalp , which is double or triple what I used to experience . I do n't seem to have any other symptoms . What is going on ? <p> The answer <p> Hair loss can cause a significant change in appearance and can be very upsetting to experience . On average , normal hair loss is less than 100 hairs per day . <p> Losing 200-300 hairs per day is abnormal , especially since you 've noticed a sudden increase in the amount . This may be an indication of your body responding to a stressful event , illness , hormonal imbalance or medication . <p> In your case , given that this is a sudden change , you have no other symptoms , and that it is generalized hair loss vs. patchy hair loss - this is most likely related to a condition called telogen effluvium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handfuls of hair and it is usually generalized involving the entire scalp . <p> Telogen effluvium may occur when there is some type of shock to your system - either emotional or physical -which causes your hair roots to be pushed prematurely into a resting state that causes the hair to fall out in large amounts . This shock could be from medications , illness , a major life stress , pregnancy or crash diets . The hair loss can occur anywhere from 6 weeks to 4 months after the initial shock to your system . <p> The reassuring news is that hair typically grows back once the triggering situation or condition is not causing further stress . Recovery can take several months and in general , no treatment is necessary . <p> While it sounds like what you are experiencing is telogen effluvium , I would still recommend seeing your doctor to confirm that there is no other cause for your hair loss . <p> Other possible causes may include but are not limited to : medical conditions such as : <p> thyroid disorders <p> other hormonal imbalances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control pills and others <p> fungal infections . <p> It 's important to note that the most common cause of hair loss is hereditary thinning so let your doctor know if you have a family history of hair loss . <p> Hair loss can be quite devastating and it may be an early sign of a potentially-reversible medical condition , so I would recommend a visit to your doctor . He or she may be able to take a complete history , run some simple tests , and make suggestions for reversing or treating a condition to prevent further hair loss . <p> Send family doctor Sheila Wijayasinghe your questions at doctor@globeandmail.com .
