Fashion Week goes rogue

<p> Maybe she 's both . The runway show producer has mounted a serious challenge to the fashion establishment , while presenting the public with an event filled with possibility . <p> On this weekday , the 42-year-old is standing in the opulent , chandeliered ballroom of Toronto 's five-star Ritz Carlton , showing a guest her vision of the Canadian fashion scene . It somehow looks a lot more enticing than the tented confines of the city 's LG Fashion Week , which starts next week . <p> " That 's where the runway will be . It will be small , intimate , invitation-only so that the guests can really see and feel what the designers are doing , " says Fullerton , in a black turtleneck and signature Herm ? s calfskin belt . " I think it will be really special . " <p> As long as Fashion Week has existed , there have been designers who are less than enamoured with the " one size fits all " philosophy of the Fashion Design Council of Canada ( FDCC ) , which puts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside their signature tents . <p> But Fullerton seems to have created credible contender status in her two-day event , called The Shows , which started Thursday . Hosted by model and actress Coco Rocha , it has shaped up to be the hottest annual ticket for some fashionistas . <p> Fullerton 's formula is simple . It consists of homegrown designers , such as Calla Haynes , Jean-Pierre Braganza , Todd Lynn and Thomas Tait , who have achieved critical acclaim abroad , showcasing their collections at a five-star venue . There will be high-profile media , stylists and socialites in a salon-like setting . And , more often than not , it will eclipse the activity of the official week that will eventually take place across from the Ritz in tents at David Pecaut Square . <p> While Fullerton 's reach may seem profound , her down-to-earth persona belies that ambition . <p> " I do n't think we 're being disruptive , there is lots of room for another show . It 's just a birthday party on another day , " she says diplomatically . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion industry , as well as corporate Canada , has taken notice . <p> At Fashion Week , designers typically pay for their shows , which means big mainstream brands with deep pockets are amply represented . Fullerton 's project is by invite only -- so you ca n't pay for runway time . <p> After all , even though Fashion Week does promote many up-and-coming designers , jaded fans looking for the next big thing are not always impressed by brands such as Joe Fresh and Jay Manuel by Sears . <p> This has given Fullerton a unique niche . Last year she debuted her show in the unfinished Trump hotel in the city 's financial district . <p> Featuring Mikhael Kale , Mark Fast and Arthur Mendon ? a , it was an inspired choice of locale and designers . It also gave Canadians a chance to see the works of acclaimed Canadians like knitwear designer Fast , who has made it big internationally but may not be well known here . <p> This year Fullerton has upped the ante , showcasing talents such as Toronto-born print designer Calla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , working with Olivier Theyskens at Nina Ricci , and menswear designer Todd Lynn , who styles Bono and Mick Jagger . <p> " There are some incredibly talented Canadians out there who can match anyone globally , but most Canadians might not know about them , " says Fullerton . <p> In only her second year , Fullerton has also signed a big sponsor , with P&amp;G Beauty &amp; Grooming coming on as a partner . <p> " We were really excited to come into something at the ground level and this was a really great idea , the idea that we are bringing Canadian designers back home , " says Carrie Truman , spokesperson for P&amp;G Beauty &amp; Grooming . P&amp;G executives had attended the Trump shows last year before making a deal this year to supply hair and makeup for models , as well as a financial commitment . <p> The consumer products conglomerate is the headline sponsor for Montreal 's Fashion Week , and getting more exposure in the Toronto market is part of its long-term strategy , putting it head to head with L'Oreal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The actual , long-winded title is LG Fashion Week Beauty by L'Oreal Paris . ) <p> Sponsorships will help with the bottom line . Last year Fullerton , working by the seat of her pants , dipped into her own pocket to pay for her event at the Trump , where she received permits to use the space from the city only days before . This year she is hoping to at least break even . <p> " Obviously it 's important to be self-sustaining . But if you 're only thinking of making money , I think you lose your voice . The machine takes over , not the art , " says Fullerton . <p> A spokesperson for the FDCC was not available for comment when asked for its position on designers showing off-site . In the past , some designers , such as Kirk Pickersgill and Stephen Wong of Greta Constantine , have decided not to show at Fashion Week , saying they prefer to retain more control over their brand and image . <p> But despite showing in an alternate venue , Fullerton is no outsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Holt Renfrew show at Fashion Week . <p> She got her start producing the first Pink Tartan fashion show for designer and friend Kimberly Newport-Mimran . There were the inevitable glitches . A model did n't show up . She quickly got someone else to substitute . She was hooked . In demand , she became the producer of the final showdown fashion shows for the Project Runway Canada reality series . <p> " I did n't know growing up you could have a job like this , it was amazing , " she says . Later , she started Paola Fullerton Inc. , which produces events and shows . She uses the money from that to help subsidize her off-Fashion-Week extravaganza . <p> The proud soccer mom ( she was about to go to her son 's first soccer game after this interview ) says she has bigger plans for The Shows next season , expanding the lineup to include other projects . <p> " It 's really about going to the highest level that we can as an industry , creating those Canadian superstars . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , as Canadians , we are also starting to believe in ourselves and the power of our own designs , " says Fullerton . <p> The Designers <p> Calla Haynes <p> * Toronto-born , but living in Paris .
