<h> Arctic ice loss has been much worse historically : study <h> " The ice will not reach a point of no return " <p> SPECIAL TO NUNATSIAQ NEWS <p> A chunk of spruce , typical of driftwood on the northern shore of Greenland , being sawn up for identification and carbon-14 dating . Scientists say the wood probably originated in forests in the drainage area of Canada 's Mackenzie or Yukon rivers about 2,000 years ago , and was carried by ice on a 5,000-km trip across the Arctic Ocean to Greenland . ( PHOTO COURTESY OF SCIENCE/AAAS ) <p> MARGARET MUNRO Postmedia News <p> The meltdown underway in the Arctic is remarkable , but an international team of beachcombers has uncovered evidence it 's been much worse before . <p> Driftwood from Canada , Alaska and Siberia picked up on the planet 's most northern beaches indicates that , for several thousand of the past 10,000 years , there was at least 50 per cent less sea ice in the Arctic than there is today , the team reports Friday in the journal Science . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches , which are now locked in ice year-round , say the scientists , who have weathered fierce summer snowstorms on their beachcombing expeditions . <p> While the researchers say they expect global warming will eventually make the Arctic sea ice disappear , they say the dire warnings about its imminent demise have been overstated . <p> " The bad news is that there is a clear connection between temperature and the amount of sea ice , " says lead author Svend Funder , at the University of Copenhagen , adding there is " no doubt " continued global warming will reduce Arctic summer sea ice . <p> " The good news is that even with a reduction to less than 50 per cent of the current amount of sea ice , the ice will not reach a point of no return , " says Funder , who has headed several treks to the inhospitable north coast of Greenland to get a better read on how the ice waxes and wanes . <p> Satellite records showing how the ice grows and retreats only go back to early 1979 -- and suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greenland north coast provides valuable long-term perspective , with the driftwood and sand on the beaches recording ice trends that go back 10,000 years . <p> Between 8,000 to 5,000 years ago , when the temperatures were warmer than today , Funder and his colleagues report , there was probably less than 50 per cent of the summer 2007 ice coverage , which was the lowest in 30-year satellite record . <p> During the pre-historic warm period , they say , the southern limit of Greenland 's year-round sea ice was about 1,000 kilometres north of where it is today . <p> The data was gathered on beaches , which are now locked behind ice that lasts all year on the northern coast of Greenland . But ridges along the beaches , dating back thousands of years , show that waves used to break along the coast , indicating plenty of open water , report the scientists , who mapped beach ridges extending 500 kilometres along the coast . <p> The driftwood is even more telling , revealing when the ice returned and how it moved around . <p> Funder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . That 's because it would take several years for wood to make it across the Arctic Ocean and " driftwood would not be able to stay afloat for that long . " <p> The most direct route is from central Siberia , with larch from the Siberian forest arriving in Greenland after a trip on the ice lasting two to five years . <p> " The voyage form North America is more precarious , " the researchers say , because the wood had to go from the Beaufort Sea and then make a detour around past Siberia , increasing the travel time to six years or more . ( Ice travels around the Arctic counter-clockwise . ) <p> Spruce from Canada and Alaska started showing up on the Greenland beaches about 6,000 years ago , and increased with the climatic cooling that then occurred , Funder said via email . <p> He said spruce makes up about 40 per cent of all the driftwood , " which at first glance is surprising " considering that the travel route is much longer than from Siberia . <p> " The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Ocean the American ice grows to be very thick and therefore a more robust wood-carrier than the thinner Siberian ice with its much shorter passage , " he said . <p> Funder said the results support the idea that sea ice could regenerate even if it 's reduced to half its current amount . But reversing the current ice loss , he said , " will require that global warming is brought to a halt , or at least slowed down significantly . " <p> While some scientists have predicted the Arctic could be ice free by the summer by 2030 or earlier , Funder said he expects the summer ice could last until the end of the century . His team 's finding also indicates the wind plays a large and under-appreciated role in shifting ice around , which could slow the loss .
