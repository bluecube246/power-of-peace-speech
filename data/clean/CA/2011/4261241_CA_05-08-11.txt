<p> The intersection at Mulcaster and Collier streets became a forum of tears , anger and speeches in the name of children and families under the blanket of child services , Friday . <p> Parents rallied as they demanded accountability for the actions of Children 's Aid Society ( CAS ) workers . <p> Barrie resident Wendy Hart shared her " horror story . " <p> " They violated us . When you 're going through it ( CAS ) you do n't realize how bad it is , " Hart said . " My son has scars all over him because they would n't send him home . He was 16 . He should n't have even been in a home . " <p> Hart 's son , now 18 , had just come back into her life after years in CAS custody when agents showed up on her hospital room after giving birth to her daughter . <p> " Three days after I had a C-section , two CAS workers came to our hospital room and said we could not leave without talking to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them and exposing my breast and feeding in front of them , they said they wanted to come home with us that night . " <p> Hart said her file with the CAS was closed at the time , but the agency 's procedures meant six months of constant monitoring . <p> " We wanted to take our daughter home and enjoy the moment and not worry about a CAS investigation , " she said . " It ruined our time with her and I 've never cried so hard . " <p> Earlier this week , Gary Perdue , media representative for the Simcoe County CAS , said the organization is governed by provincial legislation and there are " a significant number " of accountability measures in place . " If a member of the public has a complaint , there is a review board set , so this is a neutral independent third party , " he said . <p> Perdue said the CAS has a solid approach to dealing with complaints of children in distress . <p> " We respect people 's opinions who may think differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " We always respect people 's rights to voice their opinions . " <p> Pat Hudak made the drive to Barrie from Port Colborne to have his voice heard . <p> " We came from all over Ontario , " he said . " The goal for today is to bring awareness to the unlawful practice of social work and how the social workers are skirting the law . " <p> Hudak and Hart say the CAS can take a child based on little evidence of abuse or mistreatment , and can even interview children without parents knowing . <p> " No one knows what 's going on unless you 're in the middle of it. , " he said . <p> Because CAS is governed by a third-party organization , hired by the society , Hudak says investigations into mistreating children , unqualified workers , child deaths and improper interview techniques are never reported to the public . <p> " We want accountability and transparency , which we do n't have , " he said . " We want them all registered with the College of Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Groups such as the Children and Families Advocating for Accountability and Canada Court Watch have been trying to have laws changed so Ontario Ombudsman Andre Marin can investigate CAS complaints , which Hudak said is n't in the legislature . <p> " They claim to have oversight , but they do n't , " he said . " They 're a private organization . " <p> Velvet Martin returned from Alberta to attend a series of rallies , including Barrie 's , to share the story of her daughter , Samantha , and how she died in child services custody at 13 . <p> " She had 10 years of seizures that went untreated and the foster mother was approached by medical professionals , schools and myself , and she said I did n't see any myself , " she said . " My daughter received seven broken bones , three of them were in her femur , and I learned , following the fact , that my little girl died of a heart attack at age 13 . " <p> Martin said she wanted to expose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The majority of people believe in the stigma of somebody must have done something wrong , " she said . " It happens to middle-class people , it happens to professional people , and I think the public needs to become aware of that . "
