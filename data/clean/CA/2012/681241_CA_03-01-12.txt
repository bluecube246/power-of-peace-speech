clarity.fm : business advice from experts just a phone call away  a moncton , n.b. , entrepreneur who recently sold his silicon valley-based startup is set to launch another company this week .  on jan. 5 , dan martell will unveil clarity.fm , a web-based application that links budding entrepreneurs to advisors and experts , before a crowd of 500 people at the capitol theatre in moncton .  as mr. martell explains it , the service " connects speakers with seekers . "  those speakers will include more than 350 of " the world 's best technology entrepreneurs and venture capitalists . " real estate moguls , marketers and best-selling authors are also on board , he says . spanning from silicon valley to boston , new york and canada , users will be a phone call away from the advisor of their choice . once connected , the advisor aids the entrepreneur and charges a fee for his or her time .  " clarity is the easiest way to get paid for your advice , " mr. martell says , adding fees . advisors can choose to donate their fee to charity ( in which case clarity wo n't take a percentage ) . mr. martell says he hopes clarity will generate $1-million for charity in january alone .  he left moncton for silicon valley in 2008 after selling spheric technologies inc. , which developed social media applications for large companies such as johnson &amp; johnson and procter &amp; gamble . spheric technologies , which mr. martell launched in 2004 with his life savings of $70,000 -- it nearly went bankrupt in the first six weeks -- turned out to be the inspiration for clarity .  in san francisco , he launched social media firm flowtown with $750,000 , which he raised from big name investors , including mitch kapor , the founder of lotus software . that company was bought this past october by san francisco-based demandforce for a figure " in the millions . " as part of the buyout , mr. martell agreed to stay on at demandforce for a full year . he resigned in december to focus fully on clarity .  " i started now , " he says . " i decided this idea is too important . "  mr. martell is self-funding the venture with roughly $200,000 . initially , new brunswickers will get " first crack " at the service , says mr. martell , who is building a new house in moncton and plans to live in the city half the year . after the official launch , clarity will be available to anyone seeking entrepreneurial advice .  many new brunswickers , including gerry pond , the godfather of that province 's tech sector , are on clarity 's roster of experts .  how did spheric spark the idea for clarity ? two years into the business , when mr. martell was completely lost , he got some advice from an unlikely source .  " i was clueless . i did n't know what i was doing . i did n't know if what i was building was interesting or a big waste of time , " he recalls .  desperate , he sent a " cold " email to former new brunswick premier frank mckenna mckenna , now deputy chair of td bank group , directed mr. martell to some of new brunswick 's top tech founders , including mr. pond , ken nickerson , and ian cavanagh .  mr. martell still turns to them for advice . " nothing will change an entrepreneur 's life more than talking to a person who has done it successfully before , " he says . " a 10-minute phone call can change a person 's life . "
