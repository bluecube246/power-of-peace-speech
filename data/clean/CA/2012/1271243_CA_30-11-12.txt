<h> Housing costs in the top 3 <h> Company says city homes of a certain size rank just behind Vancouver , Richmond <p> In terms of single-family homes of a certain size , Burnaby is the third most expensive place to buy real estate in Canada , according to Coldwell Banker Real Estate . <p> Coldwell Banker released a listing report on Thursday that examined its average active listing prices for four-bedroom , two-bathroom single-family homes in 75 markets across the country between January and June of this year . <p> The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver 's most recent statistics for the month of October differ slightly , though the board bases its findings on a typical property within each market - not a specific size or type of single-family home . <p> Coldwell Banker found that Vancouver 's average list price for that specific type of property was nearly $1.88 million , Richmond 's was $1.18 million , and Burnaby 's was $917,968 . <p> Arthur Ng , co-owner of Coldwell Banker Westburn Realty in Burnaby , said the city has been in the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond has been second . <p> " I would say it 's fairly new in that Richmond was always less expensive than Burnaby , " he said in a phone interview Thursday . " I guess it 's all relative . It depends on what you 're looking at . " <p> Ng believes the demand in Richmond pushed the city into the top three , he said . <p> " So now with the Asian market , Richmond has actually been bumped up because of the demand from Asian buyers , " Ng explained . <p> As places in Vancouver 's westside and Richmond are bought up and prices increase , buyers will look to Burnaby , Ng predicted . <p> " I think that Burnaby , their prices are going to be creeping up as well , because it is a desirable area , and it is close to town and close to the airport , " he said . <p> But while single-family homes of that particular size may be expensive , there are still affordable options , he pointed out . <p> " If you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condos , they 're not bad places to live in , " he said . " It 's just a matter of , people 's expectations have to change . " <p> The North Shore , which Ng said had previously been one of the most expensive markets , was not included in this report , nor did it appear in the 2011 or 2010 reports . <p> Richmond was not listed in those two previous reports , either . <p> Coldwell Banker examined the average listing prices for four-bedroom , two-bathroom homes on its website between January and June for the report , excluding markets that had fewer than five such listings . <p> The real estate board releases its findings for the region on a monthly basis , and in Burnaby and Vancouver divides the cities into multiple markets . <p> According to the board 's October report , the average price for a benchmark - typical - single-family home in Burnaby was $882,166 . The highest market was South Burnaby , at $988,600 , while the lowest market was East Burnaby , at $742,400 . <p> The benchmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in at $1.45 million , while West Vancouver , North Vancouver and Richmond all had higher benchmark prices than Burnaby . <p> In 2011 , Coldwell Banker found that Vancouver 's average price for a four-bedroom , two-bathroom home was $1.54 million , with Kelowna coming in second at $1.09 million , and Burnaby coming in third at $797,455 .
