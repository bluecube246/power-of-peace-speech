<h> The news this week that Riel House will be among 27 Parks Canada national historic sites moving to " self-guided " tours next year was mourned by both staff and history buffs as a loss for the country . <p> An employee of Woodside National Historic Park stands ioutside the Kitchener home where former prime minister Mackenzie King grew up . Woodside will be among 27 national historic sites moving to " self-guided " tours next year . <p> By:Laura StoneStaff Reporter , Published on Fri Jun 15 2012 <p> The students in long dresses and vests will no longer be there . <p> There will be no one -- no humans , at least -- to explain how the river lot system was used to carry cabbage or potatoes , or to voice the significance of the M ? t is leader for the Manitoba people . <p> Follow-up questions about the black cross above the door ( the house is presented as being in mourning ) will go unanswered . <p> Instead , visitors will learn the history by reading it on a plaque or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening on a smartphone app . <p> The news this week that the 132-yetar-old Riel House in St. Vital -- where Louis Riel 's mother lived and where his body lay in state for two days in 1885 -- will be among 27 Parks Canada national historic sites moving to " self-guided " tours next year was mourned by both staff and history buffs as a loss for the country . <p> " People are losing touch with their own history and their own heritage , " said Michel Lagace , president of St. Boniface Historical Society which operates Riel House on a $56,000 budget . The society 's contract with Parks Canada will not be renewed , meaning the director and four students hired during the May to September season will not be replaced . <p> " There will be nobody to explain what the history of this place is and what it 's meaning is and what its importance is , " he said . <p> The move opens a debate about the role of heritage places , as many worry Canada 's history will become eroded because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's sad news because this is what Canadian identify rests upon , " said Pierre B ? langer , a University of Ottawa communications and Canadian studies professor . <p> " It 's us finding out about our past , working toward developing a Canadian identity , especially now with an influx of new Canadians . " <p> The sites include Laurier House in Ottawa , which commemorates prime ministers Sir Wilfrid Laurier and William Lyon Mackenzie King ; and Woodside , Mackenzie King 's boyhood home , which has been closed since September due to a toxic substance discovered in the Victorian-era house and expected to re-open this summer . <p> Parks Canada says the sites will move to self-guided tours and reduced hours as part of budget cost-cutting measures to reduce spending by $29.2 million over the next three years . <p> In total , some 600 positions will be eliminated , although not from the 167 historic sites alone . The agency is also merging services and cutting hours . <p> But , Parks Canada officials say guided tours are being eliminated primarily at sites with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only -- or even the best -- option for winning back visitors . <p> " We know that many people visit sites and they learn in a variety of different ways , " said Bill Fisher , vice-president of operations for western and northern operations for Parks Canada . He said there will likely be a security or administrative employee on site , and special events will not be precluded . <p> " For some people , maybe there 's other ways that we can draw visitors in to still learn about the site . " <p> The move to end tours at some sites was applauded by groups such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation . <p> " Unless you have the interest from the public , it 's hard to justify these things , " said federal director Gregory Thomas . " Nobody can make a case for staffing this with federal government employees with full benefits . It 's insane . Nobody goes there . " <p> Figures provided by Parks Canada show that while numbers of visitors have waned in recent years at some of the sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banff Park Museum , which is becoming self-guided , attendance grew by 32 per cent to 33 , 394 visitors between 2009-10 and 2010-11 . <p> Besides , many say popularity is beside the point . <p> " It 's a public service and by definition public service is not assessed or appraised strictly on numbers , " said Belanger . <p> The union representing Parks Canada employees also questions how artifacts such as those found in Laurier House , which includes William Lyon Mackenzie King 's crystal ball , will be protected and showcased to their full potential . <p> " It really takes away from the experience when you do n't have the ability to touch stuff , ask questions , explore , " said Eddie Kennedy , national executive vice-president of the Union of National Employees . <p> Kennedy said employees were recently issued " duty of loyalty " letters that said they were n't allowed to criticize Parks Canada or the Canadian government about the cuts . <p> For Winnipeg union representative Roxanne Hooker , the move to end what she calls " interpretation " of historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just imagine the difference between reading the text on a panel and having someone explain the significance of what 's in that text , " she said .
