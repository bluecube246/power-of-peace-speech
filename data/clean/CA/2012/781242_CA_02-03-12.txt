<p> Iceland 's newfound love for the loonie is sparking a wave of controversy , from Reykjavik to Ottawa . <p> For 150 years , the rest of the world has shown scant interest in the Canadian dollar -- the poor cousin to the coveted U.S. greenback . <p> But now tiny Iceland , still reeling from the aftershocks of the devastating collapse of its banks in 2008 , is looking longingly to the loonie as the salvation from wild economic gyrations and suffocating capital controls . <h> Social media <p> Former Industry Minister Jim Prentice , now CIBC 's vice-chair , is photographed at The Globe and Mail , March 1 , 2012 . He had been speaking about " the economic benefits of nation building infrastructure investment across Canada ; the challenges to Canadian manufacturing of a high Canadian dollar ; and how the nation can navigate a way forward . " Peter Power/ The Globe and Mail <h> Market View <p> Canadian ambassador to Iceland Alan Bones had planned to deliver remarks to a conference on the future of the Icelandic Krona , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all its inherent risks , Canada was ready to talk . <p> But his speech , slated for Saturday , was abruptly cancelled when news of the remarks was reported in Iceland and Canada , led by The Globe and Mail . <p> " Once we got wind of the speechand it went through the approval channels , we decided it was not an appropriate venue , " said Joseph Lavoie , Foreign Minister John Baird 's press secretary . " It 's a political event . So that the decision was made that it 's not an appropriate event for him to speak at . . . While he may have thought about delivering those remarks , those remarks wo n't be delivered . " <p> Mr. Lavoie pointed to a statement issued late Friday by the department as the government 's official position . <p> " Canada does not comment publicly on other countries ' currencies , " according to the statement . " This is an issue for the Icelandic government and people . " <p> A group of prominent Icelandic business leaders approached Mr. Bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a meeting the country 's opposition Progressive Party , would have been Canada 's first public response . <p> The Bank of Canada referred all calls about the issue to the Finance Department , where officials were tight-lipped . <p> There 's a compelling economic case why Iceland would want to adopt the Canadian dollar . It offers the tantalizing prospect of a stable , liquid currency that roughly tracks global commodity prices , nicely matching Iceland 's own economy , which is dependent on fish and aluminum exports , and in the future , energy . <p> There 's also a more sentimental reason . They 're both cold , Arctic countries . <p> " The average person looks at it this way : Canada is a younger version of the U.S. Canada has more natural resources than the U.S. , it 's less developed , has more land , lots of water , " explained Heidar Gudjonsson , an economist and chairman of the Research Centre for Social and Economic Studies , Iceland 's largest think tank . <p> " And Canada thinks about the Arctic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 27-member euro zone . But support among Icelanders is slipping . <p> In a recent Gallup poll , seven out of 10 Icelanders said they would happily dump their volatile and fragile krona for another currency . Their favoured alternative is the Canadian dollar , easily outscoring the U.S. dollar , the euro and the Norwegian krone . <p> Iceland is in a bind . The country imposed strict currency controls after its spectacular banking collapse in 2008 . Foreign-exchange transactions are capped at 350,000 kronur ( about $3,500 ) . A major downside of those controls is that foreign investors ca n't repatriate their profits , making Iceland an unattractive place to do business . <p> Those capital controls are slated to start coming off next year . And many experts fear a return to the wild swings of the past -- in inflation , lending rates and the currency itself . Iceland is the smallest country in the world still clinging to its own currency and monetary policy . The krona soared nearly 90 per cent between 2001 and 2007 , only to crash 92 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icelandic government plan is to adopt the euro . Iceland has applied to join the European Union and eventually the euro zone . But that 's not looking like a very attractive option these days . And formal entry could take a decade , experts said . <p> The other options are to peg the krona to another currency , such as the yen , greenback or euro . <p> It 's hard to imagine Canada would object . Iceland would n't have a say in Canadian monetary policy and the dollars coursing through its small economy ( $12-billion in GDP versus Canada 's $1.8-trillion ) would be a blip in the Bank of Canada 's management of the money supply . <p> Unilaterally taking on another country 's currency is not unheard of . El Salvador took on the U.S. dollar in 2001 . Ecuador did the same in 2000 . And Kosovo adopted the euro in 2002 . <p> There are some good reasons Canada might want to see Iceland embrace the loonie . <p> " If you join a new currency area it means you are completely open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> Adoption of the Canadian dollar could open opportunities for Canadian shipping companies , fish packers , banks , insurers and eventually oil distributors and service companies as the country taps undeveloped resources . <p> " Trade between the countries would obviously multiply , " Mr. Gudjonsson argued . <p> But the greatest benefit for Canada could be enhanced geopolitical influence in a region that 's poised to grow in economic clout . <p> The Arctic is the last frontier for the mining and oil and gas industries , sectors where Canada is already a global player . The Arctic holds an estimated 22 per cent of the world 's remaining conventional oil and gas , and vast untapped mineral potential . <p> The transition would n't be easy . The Icelandic government , through its central bank , would authorize commercial banks to exchange kronur for loonies . At today 's exchange rate , it would take roughly 100 kronur to buy a dollar . Iceland would need very strong reserves to conduct the operation , which might require an extended period when both currencies would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMPARED <p> Iceland <p> Iceland began issuing its own currency , the krona , in 1885 , replacing the Danish currency . <p> The flipside of the Iceland notes carry scenes of girls learning to embroider , a monastic scribe and 16th-century printers on the job . <p> One krona is worth less than a Canadian cent . <p> The 1,000 krona note bears the image of Brynjolfur Sveinsson , a 17th century Lutheran bishop . He is best known for compiling and preserving Old Norse literature . <p> $7.87 - the value of 1,000 krona <p> Canada <p> Canada began issuing its own currency in 1870 . Chartered were also allowed to issue their own notes . When the Bank of Canada was created in 1934 , assumed responsibility for paper notes and allowed chartered banks to print their own for another 10 years . <p> Canada 's paper currency features such figures as former prime minister John A. Macdonald and Queen Elizabeth II . <p> The flipside of Canadian notes features such scenes as children playing hockey , native art and peacekeepers . <p> Canada 's eighth prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal-Conservative Party government from 1911 to 1920 .
