<p> The 1936 Railton marked the firm ? s zenith : In later years , the company ? s cars became heavier and slower . <p> The term " hybrid " now generally means a vehicle with both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine , with the engine as the primary power . But in earlier times , hybrid referred to another type -- a car from one manufacturer with an engine from another . It often meant an English car with American power such as the Hudson-engined Brough Superior , Cadillac Allard , Nash Healey or Ford-engined Sunbeam Tiger . The car that started it , the first production Anglo-American hybrid , was the 1933 Railton fitted with Hudson Terraplane engines . <p> The Railton evolved from the Invicta manufactured by Invicta Cars of Cobham , Surrey , England , a specialist maker since 1925 that became known for fast , expensive , low-slung , sporty cars . When the depths of the Depression brought Invicta to its knees in 1933 , it closed its Cobham facility and moved to Chelsea , London , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new venture then replaced Invicta at Cobham . The initiators were Noel Macklin , a former principal of Invicta , and Reid Railton , a famous speed-record car engineer who designed land speed record-holding cars for both Sir Malcolm Campbell and John Cobb . He also created Campbell 's Bluebird II speedboat that held the Water Speed Record for 10 years . Macklin and Railton decided that mating fine English coachwork like that of the Invicta with a strong American engine and running gear would produce a spirited car . They would call it the Railton . <p> For power , they turned to a low-cost American car , the Essex Terraplane , which had been introduced by Hudson in 1932 to cope with the Depression . It came initially with a 3.2-litre side-valve , 70-horsepower six , which was five more than Henry Ford 's sensational new V-8 . And since it was mounted in a lighter car , it could outrun Ford 's more famous V-8 . <p> In 1933 , Hudson made a 4.0-litre , 94-horsepower , inline eight available in the Terraplane , and while the Terraplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It immediately began setting speed records and soon amassed over 50 American Automobile Association stock-car records , including climbing Mount Washington and Pikes Peak , and achieving 132 km/h at Daytona Beach . <p> The Terraplane-engined Railton emerged in 1933 , looking very much like the Invicta . It came as a convertible coupe and touring car , later expanded to coupes and sedans . With a weight of just 1,134 kg and a 94-horsepower eight under the hood , it had sensational performance . Contemporary tests indicated zero to 96 km/h in 10 seconds and top speed of 148 km/h . <p> This was quicker acceleration than any other English car , and would have stood up well for many years after the Second World War . Its top speed was challenged only by some more expensive marques like the Lagonda , Rolls-Royce and Bentley . It was much faster than the SS , forerunner of the Jaguar , and became an instant favourite of the motoring press . <p> The fastest Railton was the rare cycle-fendered Railton " Light Sports , " of which only three or four were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be capable of 172 km/h . <p> The Railton custom-built body was mounted on a sturdy X-braced Terraplane frame with solid axles and leaf springs front and rear . Power went to the rear wheels through Terraplane 's manual , floor-shifted , three-speed transmission and Hudson 's oil-immersed " wet " clutch . <p> Railton made a small batch of 1933 cars with the 4.0-litre Terraplane eight , then for 1934 switched to the Hudson 4.2-litre eight , which gave 113 horsepower and even more spirited performance . It became a favourite of Scotland Yard and other police forces . <p> Some 1934s got Hudson 's " Axle Flex " semi-independent , parallelogram-type front suspension , but it could be troublesome and soon Hudson and Railton were back to solid axles . <p> Railton went into 1935 unchanged and produced 377 cars , its best year ever . For 1936 , Railton got Hudson 's hydraulic brakes and a remote-control shift lever that replaced the long Hudson wand . <p> From then on , Railton seemed to lose its way as a purveyor of fast , special-interest cars . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from competitors like MG . By 1937 , Railton was back to a Hudson six-cylinder engine , and then toward the end , just before the Second World War , they were using 1.3-litre Standard fours . <p> Approximately a dozen Railtons were assembled after the war in Hudson 's Chiswick facility near London using pre-war components , but its time had passed . Although several Anglo-American hybrids like the Allard , Nash-Healey and Jensen Healey would come along , the colourful originator of the genre had passed into history . <p> The Railton name was revived in 1989 with cars based on Jaguar components , but it was not successful .
