<h> Next year 's Superhospital detour : St. Jacques bridge demolition <p> MONTREAL--NDG residents have been complaining for years about the traffic detours and closed streets forced upon the area by the construction of the MUHC superhospital . <p> The St. Jacques St. exit on the 720 Westbound has frequently been closed for months , while Girouard Ave . below Sherbrooke St. was reversed , an on-ramp to the Decarie Expressway was closed , as have several streets . <p> Now it 's about to get worse as Transport Quebec plans to demolish and reconstruct the St. Jacques Bridge over the Decarie Expressway . <p> " There is going to be some deviation around the streets in the area . We try to make it as low impact as possible , " said Ministry spokesperson Alain-Marc Dube at Tuesday evening 's " Good neighbours " meeting hosted by the MUHC superhospital . <p> The reconstruction of the overpass is slated to begin in the summer of 2013 . It will mean that once again the St. Jacques exit will be closed , as will the St. Jacques entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the meeting to hear about traffic plans , and she was not impressed . <p> " The amount of traffic from two years ago is tenfold , " said Sweeney . <p> She said driving anywhere near the Glen Yards , even on the west side of Decarie , is already very difficult , and worries that closing the St. Jacques St. bridge will create even more gridlock . <p> Fernando Lepore lives in St. Raymond , the neighbourhood sandwiched between the escarpment which parallels Highway 20 and the train tracks south of De Maisonneuve Blvd . <p> He said many residents depend on Upper Lachine Rd. and feels the city 's decision to close the eastern-most part of the road , which connects Girouard Ave . to Decarie Blvd. near Vendome metro , is a bad one . <p> " It 's going to take more time to go to work and to come back , that 's my concern , " said Lepore . <p> He said it could even force some of his tenants to move . <p> Alain Trudeau from the City of Montreal said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If the pedestrian and cyclists are at risk , we have to come to conclusion that Upper Lachine has to close , " said Trudeau . <p> Many people also asked about making sure there was access from the Vendome metro and train station to the superhospital . <p> The MUHC said that a second access point is necessary , but details are still being worked out .
