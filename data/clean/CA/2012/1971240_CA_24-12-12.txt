raising the barre  new workout craze mixes elements of ballet training with yoga and pilates moves  2her sweaty students -- who are well into their hour-long exercise class -- oblige and put down the pilates rings they were working with . with the music pounding over the speaker , they lie on mats and hold three-pound ball weights in each hand before they launch into scissor kicks , using small , rapid leg motions that have them gasping for breath .  " grab a sip of water here if you 'd like , " urges senderewich , whose students grab their water bottles .  two wooden rails line each side of the room , one spanning the whole length of the room and the other ending about halfway across .  but there is n't a ballet slipper or tutu in sight at the session , a class inspired by ballet training , but which also tosses pilates and yoga moves into the mix .  the hybrid fitness session is called a barre class ( pronounced " bar " ) and it .  barre classes have been popping up in major cities around north america over the past year or two . madonna , television personality kelly ripa and supermodel helena christensen -- all new yorkers -- are reported fans of the ballet-inspired fitness craze that promises followers long , lean muscles .  moksha yoga on waverley street is the first to bring the barre method to winnipeg , says owner ryann doucette , who currently lives in minneapolis , where she has opened up a third moksha studio .  moksha 's signature is " hot " yoga , performed in a room heated to about 37 c.  the barre room at moksha yoga is room temperature , however .  barre classes are something doucette has had her eye on for a while .  " it 's a hot new thing that 's going on everywhere else and no one is doing it in winnipeg yet , " says doucette , noting barre classes emphasize small , controlled isometric movements that may look easy but offer a tough workout using props such as pilates rings , weighted , had never heard of barre classes before his friend asked him to join her for the free class .  " it was n't what i expected , that 's for sure . i went in there expecting something on the easy side but it was a really intense workout , " says the sturgeon heights collegiate graduate and former football player who was the only guy in the class .  " i did n't even bring a towel because i did n't think i was going to sweat . but i left there and i was drenched . i got a really good burn from some of the leg exercises and the core ( work ) .  " it 's a little embarrassing being the only guy in the class and not being able to keep up with everyone . "  his friend , christine ormiston , 25 , felt the same way .  " my sister is a personal trainer . she messaged me and was like , ' sign up for this class . it 's free . it 's new , ' the highest in the class . " it was challenging . i feel really good now . i was sweating like crazy . "  jennifer gottwald , 38 , found the barre workout different than her typical hot yoga class . " this kind of opens you up more to have some fun . i like the change of pace . "  during the barre session of the class , the students lightly hold onto the barre while the instructor asks her students to back into a curtsey before quickly lunging forward and kicking one leg out .  most of the people in the class looked as if they were familiar with yoga terminology and did n't have trouble following the yoga-inspired moves .  senderewich notes that even yoga novices and people with tight , inflexible muscles would benefit from a barre class , since moves can be modified based on the individual 's ability . throughout the class , senderewich walks up and down the middle of the class , helping students align their bodies correctly if they need assistance .  " we 're pushing says . " and we repeat it . so if you do n't get it the first time , you 'll get it the second time or the third time . "  the class is a dream come true for monica rietvelt , a financial adviser .  a year or two ago , she watched a barre-style class in southern california , wishing she had the courage to try it .  " it looked super tough . it was a 90-minute class and the room was partially heated . the instructor was a former triathlete . she kind of scared me , so i just watched it through the window , " says rietvelt , who has dropped three dress sizes since taking up yoga a few years ago .  when the winnipeg mother of two found out one of her favourite yoga studios was offering barre here , she decided it was time to " stir things up a bit . "  she has no regrets .  " i feel fantastic . i 'm probably more energized than i feel after yoga , " toughest part of the class .  as for her childhood dreams of becoming a ballerina , she says today they were , in a way , realized .  " i really did n't think i had the right body type for that ... i 've never been a small person .  you can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com . you can also agree or disagree with other comments . all you need to do is be a winnipeg free press print or e-edition subscriber to join the conversation and give your feedback .
