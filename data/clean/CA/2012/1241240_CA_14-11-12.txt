<h> Sports Hockey <h> Stanley Cup winner Mike Richards joins road hockey game at The Forks <p> Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun <p> Wednesday , November 14 , 2012 8:55:14 EST AM <p> L.A. Kings forward Mike Richards gestures to a teammate during a street hockey game on the roof of the parkade at The Forks in Winnipeg , Man. , on Tues. , Nov. 13 , 2012 . Winnipeg Jets players Andrew Ladd , Jim Slater and Mark Stuart also took part . JASON HALSTEAD/Winnipeg Sun/QMI Agency <p> A quartet of locked-out NHLers turned back the clock on Tuesday afternoon , participating in a road hockey game at The Forks . <p> The idea was the brainchild of TSN personality Cabbie and Winnipeggers got on board immediately , as roughly 200 people of all ages answered a call on Twitter to take part in a game that featured Winnipeg Jets captain Andrew Ladd and Los Angeles Kings centre Mike Richards , a Kenora product who captured the Stanley Cup last spring . <p> " We knew that Winnipeg is a die-hard hockey market , so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cabbie , who served as the referee . " My favourite moment was maybe when the police played . And all of the little guys . That was fun . " <p> Richards and Ladd engaged in a little bit of friendly trash talking on Twitter , but ended up getting the desired result by connecting with fans who are becoming increasingly frustrated as the NHL lockout drags on . <p> Ladd 's squad ended up earning a 5-3 victory , but this was more about channelling the love of the game . <p> " This is our way of staying in the community and being involved , " said Ladd . " With the situation , it makes it a lot tougher for fans to see us . This was a great idea by Cabbie to set this up . " <p> " The fans are missing hockey just as much as we are , " said Richards . " We 're not only players in the game , but fans of the game . We miss being around the guys and around competitive hockey . Not being around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing it . " <p> Playing in the great outdoors makes Jets defenceman Mark Stuart think of growing up in Minnesota and engaging in some memorable battles with his brothers and sisters in the backyard . <p> " There were some pretty good ones . Not too much fighting , it was pretty friendly , " said Stuart . " My dad built a rink in the yard when we were growing up and we would get out there . <p> " As far as ball hockey ( goes ) , I have n't played in a while . This brings me back . We 'd like to be at the MTS ( Centre ) playing games . But this is a unique experience for everybody . " <p> Stuart was among the NHL leaders in blocked shots last season , but made a minor adjustment to his game on this chilly afternoon . <p> " The ( ball ) was frozen already , I did n't really come prepared , " said Stuart . " I should have taped my shin pads on or something . " <p> Jets centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street hockey games as a youngster , imagining he was Bill Ranford making big glove saves . <p> " This is awesome , " said Slater . " I used to love playing goalie . It 's always awesome to get back and play some hockey like how you grew up . <p> " I did n't know what to expect , but when you say hockey in Winnipeg , you expect big things and obviously this turned out really good .
