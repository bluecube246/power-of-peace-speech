By:Carrie AntlfingerAssociated Press , Published on Fri Mar 02 2012  MILWAUKEE -- A marketing group in Wisconsin wants to give walking tours of the bar where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer met and hung out with some of his victims .  But when victims ' families and others found out about the tours this week through a Groupon promotion for a cut-rate tour , they started calling for the tour , which they described as insensitive and in poor taste , to end .  Bam Marketing and Media spokeswoman Amanda Morden said Thursday the company is not deterred and the first two tours are Saturday in Milwaukee and have nearly group president Victor Ray , who says it 's too soon for a tour since the crimes are just 2 decades old and many family members of Dahmer 's victims are still around .  " I just do n't think this is the right timing , " said Ray , who heads the Walker 's Point Association . " And a tour of the area is not the right thing to do . It 's sensationalism in its finest . "  Ray said he 's received 75 emails , most against the tours , and that some plan to protest Saturday , including some family members of victims . He said he 's been in contact with one victim 's mother , who asked for his group 's help .  " She said ' Do what you can to stop it , ' " Ray said . The woman did n't want to be interviewed by reporters .  He met with Morden and another tour group representative Thursday night and hoped he had convinced them to quit the tours . But Morden said they have a legitimate the crimes , rather than the sensational nature of them .  Dahmer , a chocolate factory worker , would frequent gay bars in the area . He was arrested in 1991 and admitted to killing 17 young men , some of whom he mutilated and cannibalized . He was serving life prison sentences when a fellow inmate beat him to death in 1994 .  His apartment building -- where he stored body parts -- was eventually razed . There 's been talk over the years about putting a memorial there , but the idea has received mixed reactions . Morden said they hoped to put a plaque with the victims ' names on one of the businesses in the area as a memorial .  She also said a portion of the tour profits will be donated to charity , although a specific one has n't been chosen .  Ray called it a token gesture . " I do n't think that 's going to make a difference to the community , " he said .  The area is in the middle of a revitalized section of that once housed bars Dahmer would frequent .  Morden described it as a legitimate walking tour that looked at the killer 's crimes from a historical perspective , rather than with macabre fascination . She compared it to a book or a documentary , but in a different format .  " Whether we like it or not it 's part of our city 's history , " she said . " It 's part of our nation 's history . "  Morden said she thought enough time had passed to look at the crimes objectively . The tour group is sensitive to the victims ' families , she said , but has not sought their feedback .  " We are not being evasive in any way , " she said . " If there is a concern we would be happy to address it . "  At least two schools have expressed interest for educational reasons , she said . Plans have been made to meet with them next week .  Groupon offered two tickets for $25 , instead of the normal $60 , and " into Dahmer 's life . But only 15 tickets sold before the daily-deal website closed the promotion . Spokesman Nicholas Halliwell said in an emailed statement that it was never Groupon 's intention to offend anyone .  It 's not unusual for gruesome crimes to become part of a city 's lore . There are tours in London about Jack the Ripper , in Los Angeles about Charles Manson , and in Boston about the Boston Strangler .  But local tourism group VISIT Milwaukee wo n't promote it .  " We do n't need to give notoriety to an individual like Jeffrey Dahmer who did painful and hurtful things and did nothing to further the community 's image , " spokeswoman Jeannine Sherman said .  Alderman James Witkowiak said the city ca n't stop the tours because organizers are using public spaces and they are protected by free speech laws .  It 's more of a grey area for Sara Drescher , who manages a pub in the neighbourhood . She did n't think it would affect business and she doubted there would be much people being able to start a business but not at the expense of victims ' families .  " It 's a difficult thing , and I do n't know the right way for it to be handled , " Drescher said .
