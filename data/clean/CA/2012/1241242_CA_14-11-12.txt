as part of efforts to cut costs and streamline internet services , mysudbury.ca is logging off .  since oct. 1 , web surfers trying to access the site have been automatically redirected to the city 's main site , greatersudbury.ca .  when it began in 2005 , mysudbury.ca was intended to be more than just a website . a staff report going before city councillors nov. 13 said the goal was to build web applications such as emails , online collaborative web spaces , an online community directory and an online volunteer registry .  " the program was designed to realize municipal efficiencies by leveraging the technology infrastructure to quickly deploy web applications such as airport flight information displays , healthy community web presence , and the creation of www.sudburytourism.ca with the selling of vacation packages online , " the report reads .  the report says for every dollar invested in the program in 2008 , it generated $3.50 ; the amount increased to $4.30 in 2009 , $5.30 in 2010 , and $5.30 in 2011 . since its launch in 2005 , looking at about 18 million pages .  however , as other web infrastructure developed in greater sudbury , the usefulness of mysudbury.ca began to wane .  " many of the tools and much of the information that the community portal was designed to provide can now be accessed through other sites free of charge , " the report says . " at the same time , members of council questioned the need for the portal and expressed concerns regarding value for money . "  the review also found mysudbury.ca to be too old and costly to bring up to date . by shutting down the site now , the city will save about $126,000 in 2013 .  darren macdonald  reader 's feedback  northernlife.ca may contain content submitted by readers , usually in the form of article comments . all reader comments and any opinions , advice , statements or other information contained in any messages posted or transmitted by any third party are the responsibility of the author of that message and not of northernlife.ca . the fact that a particular message is posted on northernlife.ca has endorsed that message in any way or verified the accuracy , completeness or usefulness of any message . we encourage visitors to northernlife.ca to report any objectionable content by clicking the " x " on the top right of the comment in question . comment guidelines
