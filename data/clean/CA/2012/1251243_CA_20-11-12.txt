these headphones are feather light ( 105 grams ) . as a result , you can throw them into a bag and they 're not going going to weigh you down . more importantly , the light weight means they can sit on your head for extended periods and you wo n't feel like you 're wearing a weighted clamp on your skull .  part of the wearing comfort comes from the way the earcups are designed . you can slide them up and down or rotate them in a variety of ways which makes them infinitely adjustable for all shapes and sizes of heads .  while comfort is important , the most vital consideration for any headphones is the quality of the sound they deliver . that can be summed up with one adjective -- excellent .  while these are in no way noise-cancelling headphones , the small padded cups that fit over your ears are sufficient to keep out a lot of background noise so you do n't have to crank up the volume to dangerous levels to hear what you are metal design of the phones is understated . the only bling to be found on them is little more than a subtle rha logo on the side . they are almost retro in their styling , looking like something you 'd find in an audio engineer 's studio circa 1964 .  the audio cable features gold-plated connections and is detachable from the headphones which helps eliminate breakage and it is covered with a braided fabric to reduce tangling .  there 's also a remote control to manage volume on apple iphones , ipads and ipods as well as a microphone so you can converse with people while plugged into your mobile device .  there are headphones that you tolerate -- like the ear buds they give you on airplanes or the ones that come with your cellphone . they work okay but they do n't fit inside your ear particularly well , bouncing out when you go for a jog . and the sound , well , the sound is nothing great .  then there are rha 's ma450i aluminum , noise-isolating headphones . every irritation that been lovingly addressed by rha .  apparently all ears are not created equal . it 's with that thought in mind that rha provides seven interchangeable tips for a comfortable fit and enhanced noise isolation . the tips come in a handy carrying case which helps ensure you do n't misplace them .  another bugaboo that rha seems to have reduced is the tangled cord . replacing the usual wire that tends to get hopelessly tangled when bouncing around your bag or pockets is a fabric-braided , reinforced 1.5-metre cable .  the headphones also come with a remote and microphone which allow them to be use with most ipod/iphone models . the attention to quality continues with gold-plated connections .  but it 's the sound that really hits it out of the ballpark for rha . the earbuds , which are based on the design of a trumpet , produce a mellow and richly-balanced sound . there 's not a hint of tinniness . the sound quality is made even better as a result of the effective noise-isolating nature of these ear buds . there 's nothing line is that rha 's earphone and headphones would make a great gift for everyone from the the frequent traveller to the ipod-addicted teen on your holiday gift list .
