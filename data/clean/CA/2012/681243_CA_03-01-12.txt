But while the world of communications is undergoing a drastic digital change , an affordable Canadian postal system is essential for the survival of many Canadian businesses , particularly small entrepreneurs , a clutch of local business owners say .  " My business would not exist without the postal system because couriers are outrageously expensive , " said Becky Stone , the co-owner of the Hudson , Que. -based Organic Quilt Company .  Her firm 's two online stores ship to customers around the world and the firm also imports many of the supplies it uses in its creations from the United States . Ms. Stone said the brokerage fees charged by courier firms that ship across the U.S. border are too steep for her home-based business to absorb , leaving Canada Post her only option .  " Canada Post charges an official customs fees that is a fraction of what the courier firms cost , " she said .  If she was forced to hike her prices to cover courier brokerage costs , her items , which sell from around $15 for quilt , would be too expensive for her customers and her business model would no longer function .  Toronto-based retail analyst John Williams expects the use of postal services in Canada will dramatically decrease in the near future .  " The post office management has got to get used to it and face the facts and act accordingly , " he said , adding that the U.S. postal service is losing millions .  The U.S. Postal Service said this month it would cut back on services and shut down more than 200 mail processing centres , which would increase mail delivery times .  Annie Dubois , the owner of the booming DringDring Inc. , which makes hand-painted bicycle bells , says cutbacks at Canada Post could be disastrous for her business .  " My entire online business depends on the Canada Post service , " she said . " I ca n't depend on FedEx because the cost of shipping one bell is equal to the cost of the bell or more . "  Ms. Dubois had a huge surge in overseas orders this month Christmas gifts . " It was non-stop , " she said , as customers in England bought hundreds of bells during the night from her website while she was sleeping . " It really went crazy . "  Ms. Dubois said she would n't have been able to afford to fill those orders without Canada Post . She benefits from a shipping discount available from Canada Post to small entrepreneurs called the Venture 1 program when she sends small packages using standard international airmail delivery .  " It 's the cheapest way to ship internationally when I send a bell to Japan or Australia -- like I do every week , " she said .  Despite the challenges facing the Canadian postal service sector , retail analyst Mr. Williams acknowledged Canada Post still plays a vital role for small Canadian entrepreneurs .  " I used to own a catalogue business and Canada Post was our lifeblood , " he said . " We could n't afford to ship by courier.
