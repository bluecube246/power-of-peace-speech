' moon river ' crooner andy williams dead at 84  branson , mo . -- for the older -- ok , squarer -- side of the generation gap , andy williams was part of the soundtrack of the 1960s and ' 70s , with easy-listening hits like " moon river , " the " love story " theme and " the most wonderful time of the year " from his beloved christmas tv specials .  the singer known for his wholesome , middle-america appeal was the antithesis of the counterculture .  " the old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s , you were n't there , " williams once recalled . " well , i was there all right , but my memory of them is blurred -- not by any drugs i took but by the relentless pace of the schedule i set myself . "  the 84-year-old entertainer , who died tuesday night at his branson home following a yearlong battle with bladder cancer , outlasted many of the decade 's rock stars and fellow crooners such as charts into the 1970s and continued to perform into his 80s .  williams became a major star in 1956 , the same year as elvis presley , with the sinatra-like swing number " canadian sunset . " for a time , he was pushed into such presley imitations as " lips of wine " and the no. 1 smash " butterfly . "  but he mostly stuck to what he called his " natural style " and kept it up throughout his career . in 1970 , when even sinatra had temporarily retired , williams was in the top 10 with the theme from " love story , " the oscar-winning tearjerker . he had 18 gold records , three platinum and five grammy award nominations .  williams was also the first host of the live grammy awards telecast and hosted the show for seven consecutive years , beginning in 1971 .  movie songs became a specialty , including his signature " moon river . " the longing johnny mercer-henry mancini ballad was his most famous song , even though he never released it as a single huckleberry friend " were too confusing and old-fashioned for teens .  the song was first performed by audrey hepburn in the cherished 1961 film " breakfast at tiffany 's , " but mancini thought " moon river " ideal for williams , who recorded it in " pretty much one take " and also sang it at the 1962 academy awards . although " moon river " was covered by countless artists and became a hit single for jerry butler , williams made the song his personal brand . in fact , he insisted on it .  " when i hear anybody else sing it , it 's all i can to do stop myself from shouting at the television screen , ' no ! that 's my song ! " ' williams wrote in his 2009 memoir titled , fittingly , " moon river and me . "  at a wednesday matinee at williams ' moon river theatre in branson , a performer told the crowd that williams would have wanted the show to go on , and it did . the first show after his death take my eyes off of you . "  " it was very emotional , very sad , " said barbara cox of atlanta , who came to branson on vacation . " we 've lost a great man . "  carol and ruth harding , sisters who travelled from suburban denver to attend a second show wednesday evening , said they 've been williams fans since they were teenagers . the women , both in their early 70s and married to brothers , said they 'd seen him perform numerous times , including 10 trips to his christmas show .  " it 's not going to be the same without him , " ruth harding said . " it 's like losing a family member . he 's been part of our family . "  because of illness , williams had not performed in several months  he had been a constant presence on television with " the andy williams show , " which lasted in various formats through the 1960s and into 1971 . it won three emmys and featured williams alternately performing his stable of on that show that williams -- who launched his own career as part of an all-brother quartet -- introduced the world to another clean-cut act -- the original four singing osmond brothers of utah . four decades later , the osmonds and williams would find themselves in close proximity again , sharing williams ' theatre in branson .  williams did book some rock and soul acts , including the beach boys , the temptations and smokey robinson . on one show , in 1970 , williams sang " heaven help us all " with ray charles , mama cass and a then-little known elton john , a vision to williams in his rhinestone glasses and black cape . but williams liked him and his breakthrough hit " your song " enough to record it himself .  for many families , williams and his music were a holiday tradition . his annual christmas specials continued long after his show ended , featuring williams dressed in colorful sweaters singing favourites that almost always included " the most wonderful time of the year , " a song written for williams that became apparently , not an act . the singer 's unflappable manner on television and in concert was mirrored offstage .  " i guess i 've never really been aggressive , although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be , " he once said . " my trouble is , i 'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines . "  his wholesome image endured one jarring interlude .  in 1976 , his ex-wife , former las vegas showgirl claudine longet , shot and killed her lover , skiing champion spider sabich . the rolling stones mocked the tragedy in " claudine , " a song so pitiless that it was n't released until decades later . longet , who said the slaying was an accident , spent only a week in jail . williams stood by her . he escorted her to the courthouse , testified on her behalf and provided support for her and their children , noelle , christian and robert .  also in the 1970s , williams was seen frequently in the company of denied any romantic involvement .  he was born howard andrew williams in wall lake , iowa , on dec. 3 , 1927 , and began performing with older brothers dick , bob and don in the local presbyterian church choir . their father , postal worker and insurance man jay emerson williams , was the choirmaster and the force behind his children 's career .  when andy was 8 , williams ' father arranged for the kids to have an audition on des moines radio station who 's iowa barn dance . they were initially turned down but kept returning until they were finally accepted . the show attracted attention from chicago , cincinnati and hollywood . another star at who was a young sportscaster named ronald reagan , who would later praise williams as a " national treasure . "  the brothers later worked with kay thompson , a singer who eventually became famous for the " eloise " children 's books . she had taken a position as vocal coach at mgm studios , working with judy garland , june allyson and others . after three in their show at the el rancho room in las vegas , drawing rave reviews and as much as $25,000 a week .  after five years , the three older brothers , who were starting their own families , had tired of the constant travel and left to pursue other careers .  williams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs .  a two-year tv stint on steve allen 's " tonight show " and a contract with cadence records turned things around . williams later formed his own label , barnaby records , which released music by the everly brothers , ray stevens and jimmy buffett .  williams was a lifelong republican who once accused president barack obama of " following marxist theory . " but he acknowledged experimenting with lsd , opposed the nixon administration 's efforts in the 1970s to deport john lennon and in 1968 was an energetic supporter of robert kennedy 's presidential campaign .  when kennedy was assassinated in los angeles in june 1968 sang " the battle hymn of the republic " at his funeral .  " we chose that song because he used it on the campaign trail , " williams later said of kennedy , who had been a close friend . " he had a terrible voice , but he loved to sing that song . the only way i got through singing in church that day was by saying , ' this is my job . i ca n't let emotion get in the way of the song . ' i really concentrated on not thinking about him . "  after giving up touring , he settled in branson , with its dozens of theatres featuring live music , comedy and magic acts , and was among the first wave of national entertainers to perform there regularly .  when he arrived in 1992 , the town was dominated by country music , but williams changed that with his classy , $13 million theatre in the heart of the entertainment district , where he did two shows a night , six days a week , nine months of back to one show a night . his most popular time was christmas .  not everyone in hollywood accepted his move to the midwest . " the fact is most of my friends in la still think i 'm nuts for coming here , " he told the associated press in 1998 .  he and his second wife , the former debbie haas , divided their time between homes in branson and palm springs , california , where he spent his leisure hours on the golf course when branson 's theatres were dark during the winter months following christmas .  retirement was not on his schedule . as he told the ap in 2001 : " i 'll keep going until i get to the point where i ca n't get out on stage .
