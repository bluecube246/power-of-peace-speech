Making a difference  When Lori Rogers saw the slum-like conditions some St. John 's residents were living in , she felt determined to do something to help .  It was heartbreaking , she said , to see an old wire hanger hooked into a door in place of a knob ; to be asked by an elderly couple whether she could replace their stove -- only one burner worked , one of the seniors told her .  The bathrooms in several apartments were so run down , Rogers says , it was difficult to fathom how anyone could feel comfortable in such conditions .  What made the situations that much worse , was that many of the people living in the apartments were on income support and battling mental illnesses .  After seeing too many people living in deplorable apartments , Rogers formed Right Turn Investments in 2009 and started purchasing and restoring older homes .  " I was so embarrassed to be buying those properties knowing how poor they looked , " the 44-year-old says .  Her goal was them to single parents , people with mental health issues , those leaving shelters , former inmates of Her Majesty 's Penitentiary and others who many landlords would turn their backs on .  Rogers bought her first rental property at 21 . She currently rents 19 one- and two-bedroom apartments in nine homes in St. John 's and has formed partnerships within the community to help her make her tenants feel at home .  Whether it 's a local carpet factory donating a piece of flooring , a furniture company offering some surplus product or a builder giving away a set of stairs , the partnerships are what set her business apart from others in the real estate industry .  Rogers has also partnered with St. Thomas Anglican Church to collect donations of furniture and appliances and other necessities for her tenants . The church is renting a storage unit where the donations are stored until needed .  " The partnerships are where we are able to save money and then put the savings into another property , " she says .  Volunteers from the church , pitch in and help clean up the homes once she buys them , she says .  " Lori gives them some respect . It 's not people telling them what to do anymore . It 's Lori requesting their help . And that 's really good positive reinforcement , " Cullen says .  Listening to vulnerable people is n't new to Rogers . She worked as an activity co-ordinator at St. Luke 's Homes in St. John 's for over a decade and in a long-term care facility in Ontario for five years where she cared for people with Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia .  Whatever the work , her outlook on life is simple : treat people with respect and get it back in return .  " People are human , and sometimes all you need is to listen to somebody . And I tell my clients I 'm not above you , I 'm right here by you . "  Trudy White-Morgan has been living in one of Rogers ' apartments for about eight years .  Rogers has brought says .  " She 's been wonderful to me . She helped me out when I was basically lower than low , " White-Morgan says .  The low point in her life was when her husband walked out on her and her young daughter .  " Lori and Roxanne were there for me emotionally . They gave me an ear when I really needed it . "  Rogers lowered the rent when Morgan-White became a single parent . Morgan-White helped in return by looking after the two other apartments in the building .  Morgan-White 's daughter , Morgan , is now eight years old .  Rogers has been particularly good to her daughter through the years , she says , taking her to movies and to a show at Mile One Centre .  During a visit to their home , Morgan reached for the stuffed reindeer with red and green bells tied to its antlers that Rogers gave her for Christmas .  " You put him on the table and turn him on and he sings a song and bumps around and around giving the toy a squeeze before placing him back on a shelf .  Morgan-White says she 's grateful to Rogers for giving her a place to call home -- for the long term .  It 's great to have someone other than her elderly father and brothers to depend on , she says .  " Lori has always been kind to me and Morgan . And I know , if it comes to the crunch , her and Roxanne will be here for me . "  Rev. John Paul Westin , rector of St. Thomas Church , says Rogers is making a difference in many people 's lives . His congregation and other people in the community are quick to donate items for her apartments , he says , as they know they are helping vulnerable people .  " A lot of landlords are n't interested in having people with mental health problems as tenants . Lori is providing the housing but she 's also providing support and friendship . Almost like a family relationship . "  Comments  Comments  Your name*Email*Comment*  Recent  You are two very caring ladies . However , as already mentioned , this is not just a problem for the mentally ill or social assistance recipients ; it is rampant for the lower income working class . Also a lot of OAS income people are involved in this dilemma . But the two of you are certainly doing more than your share . God bless you ( and your little dog ) .  Lori , you sound like an excellent member of society who cares for people . I wish you the best ! This is not just a problem now for the mental ill and people who are on social assistance , or for only the lower class . There is a general crisis for everyone ! Whether poor or middle class , many are suffering ! Slumlords are everywhere ! I was recently in a fire because of a slumlord and I was paying a lot in rent .
