Not all of us are wired for math

<h> Not all of us are wired for math <p> From now on , whenever a kid who gets math anxiety has to sweat through a math test , she 'll have a real scientific study to back her up . <p> According to researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine , brain function actually differs in people who have math anxiety from those who do n't . <p> The study used a series of brain scans conducted on second- and third-grade students while the children solved addition and subtraction problems . <p> What they found was increased activity in regions of the brain associated with fear , which led to decreased activity in other parts involved with problem-solving . Students with higher math anxiety naturally tended to score lower than their less-anxious peers . <p> Vinod Menon , PhD , the Stanford professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences who led the research , summarized the findings : <p> " The same part of the brain that responds to fearful situations , such as seeing a spider or snake , also shows a heightened response in children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that despite the scientific community 's 50-plus-year-old awareness of math anxiety , no one has really done much research on it until now . <p> Dr. Victor Carrion , an expert on the effects of anxiety in children , hope that the findings , published this month in Psychological Science , will improve the educational system for students with math anxiety : <p> " The results are a significant step toward our understanding of brain function during math anxiety and will influence development of new academic interventions . " <p> Menon 's lab is now looking for new second- and third-graders for their next study . Participants would receive a modest payment for their participation , as well as a month of free math tutoring . <p> The next question will be , how will kids utilize this information in an attempt to avoid taking math tests ? I only wish this study would have been performed back when I was in high school .
