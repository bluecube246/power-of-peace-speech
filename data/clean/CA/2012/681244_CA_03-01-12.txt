<h> What to See at the Next Stage Theatre Festival <p> Simon Bracken and Leah Doz in Tomasso 's Party , the first play from author Jules Lewis . <p> The holidays are over , most of us are back at work , and it 's cold . Really cold . But before you strap on your sad hats and grumpy galoshes for good until the first sign of spring , you should probably check out a play or two at the 2012 Next Stage Festival , the annual winter companion to the Toronto Fringe Festival . <p> In its fifth year , the NSF is presenting 10 shows from January 4 to 15 at the Factory Theatre . There 's something for everyone : shows both familiar and brand new , artists both up-and-coming and iconic , and themes ranging from the absurd to the political to the dramatic . Not to mention a heated beer tent . <p> So get a taste of the summer in the coldest time of the year , and catch a show at the Next Stage Festival . Here are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stranger , or How to Recognize an InvertECCE HOMO THEATRE <p> Ecce Homo 's cabaret shows , with their use of found text and the critical eyes they cast on polarizing figures such as Mother Teresa and Lady Gaga , are always provocative , but Loving the Stranger is perhaps artistic director Alistair Newton 's most personal show of late . Poignantly , the central figure in the play 's story , Montreal artist and designer Peter Flinsch , passed away on the same day the show had its first public workshop ( the show had its full debut at the 2010 SummerWorks Festival ) . Flinsch was arrested for kissing a Nazi officer at a party in 1942 , and Newton , who learned about Flinsch while in Germany researching mid-century anti-gay laws , was the last person to interview Flinsch before his death . Since the first run of Loving , Newton has updated the show , which also encompasses California 's gay marriage debates . ( Steve Fisher ) <p> Tomasso 's PartyROOFTOP CREATIONS <p> This premiere embodies the festival 's blend of emerging and established theatrical talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty dialogue in his 2010 novel Waiting For Ricky Tantrum , but makes his script-writing debut with Tomasso 's Party , which revolves around a romantic relationship choked with anxieties and quirks . The participants in said relationship are also relatively new to Toronto 's theatre scene -- both Simon Bracken and Leah Doz are recent grads of the esteemed National Theatre School in Montreal . But a name definitely worthy of dropping is Dora Award-winning actor Nigel Shawn Williams , who takes directorial reigns on this show on the heels of rave reviews over his performance in Topdog/Underdog ( he also directed last year 's acclaimed Brothel #9 ) . Together , this team makes for one of the festival 's most exciting shows . ( Carly Maga ) <p> The Next Stage Festival features a few crowd favourites from the previous year 's Fringe Festival ( including a few of our own , too ) , but perhaps the most welcome return is the sketch troupe Uncalled For , with their wacky journey through the mental limbo between consciousness and sleep , Hypnogogic Logic . Unbounded by rationality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concepts in a manner that somehow earns the latter half of the title . Though Toronto audiences have been able to catch Uncalled For since , we 're looking forward to seeing this Best of Fringe Uptown choice on stage again . In fact , we 're practically snoring in anticipation .

Happily , both shows are easy recommendations for us . Love is a Poverty You Can Sellwas a hit of the 2010 Fringe Festival , and the 2012 edition is a " condensed " version of the Kurt Weill cabaret , with a smaller orchestra , but many of the delightful numbers are intact ( including Christian Jefferies ' two very different torch songs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between M.C. 's Hans and Jodel ( Ryan Anning and Scott Dermody ) . The other Antechamber presentation is a new clown show from Morro and Jasp , who 've been one of the most popular clown acts on the Fringe circuit ( heck , in Toronto altogether ) in recent years . For Go Bake Yourself , the two bickering sisters have very different ideas of what sort of cooking show they want to star in : an intense Iron Chef-style competition , or a Julia Child-style love-in . ( Steve Fisher ) <p> Looking towards this summer 's upcoming Fringe Festival , expectations are high for this year 's New Play Contest winner , Kat Sandler , and her play Help Yourself . ( Last year 's winner , Ins Choi 's Kim 's Convenience , was a runaway hit , and will be remounted by Soulpepper Theatre . ) In the meantime , the Next Stage Festival is offering a sample of what 's to come with a remount of Theatre Brouhaha 's LOVESEXMONEY . Sandler is Brouhaha 's artistic director , and this show was the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and returning performers and creators , we 're looking forward to getting a glimpse of how the team has grown in their first year of operation , and an idea of where they 're going next .
