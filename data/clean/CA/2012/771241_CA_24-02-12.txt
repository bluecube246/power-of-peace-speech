<h> Related Stories <h> Related Videos <p> Alarms have been raised over Bill C-30 , a law that would allow police to monitor Canadians ' Internet and e-mails . However , privacy analysts warn the horse has already left the barn : We are all being watched . <p> " The Stasi would have loved the kind of technology and the amount of information we have in these days . It 's certainly a concern , " says David Murakami Wood , Canada Research Chair in Surveillance Studies at Queens University . <p> Murakami Wood said while we are n't in a government-led Big Brother surveillance society yet , the potential is there , and there is a lack of awareness about how often we are observed and tracked . <p> " There is an apathy about it . They are generally aware , they have seen Minority Report , but they are not aware enough at all , " he said . <p> From secret surveillance at border crossings to GPS tracking of shopping habits , the watchful eye is on us like no other time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used to remove power from governments - as the revolts in the Arab Spring have shown - democracies must stay vigilant that it does n't go the other way as well . <p> " In Germany , they are the ones who always remind us what they had to endure in the Third Reich and how easily things can change , " Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian warns . <p> " Do n't think that this is impossible or far from reality and that is why we have to be vigilant to protect the freedoms we have now . They start with privacy - it is at the heart of all of our freedoms . " <p> At the border : <p> For the first time in our shared history , exit controls will start being used on all Canadians and Americans when they leave their country of citizenship . <p> The practice was agreed to in 2011 , when the latest security agreement was signed between Ottawa and Washington . Starting in 2014 , when a U.S. border guard leans in your car window and asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will instantly share that information with the Canadian government . <p> To avoid the fuss , the new Nexus program just scans the iris of your eyeball at the Canada-U.S. border ( again , just like in the film Minority Report ) , and knows what you are up to without having to see your passport or ask questions . <p> The hand-held computers can pinpoint a person 's location to within 12 inches of where they are standing any place on the planet where satellite signals can find them . <p> New technology using smartphones allowed stores to follow people through malls for first time this past Christmas , monitoring and mapping shoppers ' movements . <p> Companies hope to use the collected data for direct advertising . <p> Police use phone GPS data to track suspects and then use it in court to put the accused at the scene of a crime ( or to give them an alibi . ) <p> " This notion of having cellphones that are constantly recording where everyone goes has been very good for the government , " says Jeff Fischbach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded , and presents it for court cases . <p> " This default that when you delete something it simply disappears from sight but is still available to be found does n't serve the individual . Maybe it 's just a coincidence that the U.S. government is the biggest customer of these companies . " <p> In the car : <p> Turn off the GPS functions on your phone ? That 's OK . Modern vehicles all have GPS transponders to track the car 's locater beacon even if the assistance program is n't subscribed to . <p> " If you are running a newer car , it 's probably communicating with the dealership and you will get a cellphone call reminding you your car needs a tune-up . New cars have significant two-way data streams , " says Fischbach . <p> " New tires , they may have imbedded in the rubber some RFID chips . Those chips will ... send out data . They were n't sold as a way to follow your vehicle , but they could certainly be used that way . " <p> In the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of passing cars , constantly running the digits through a database , with the owners ' photograph popping up on screen . <p> Out of the car , security cameras in parking lots and computers built into pay meters record your movements and note the time . <p> Where you live : <p> If you think you 're safe from prying eyes at home , think again . <p> " We can get data from surveillance cameras , kitchen appliances , video game systems , televisions , cars , smart phones - anything at all with a computer , I can get information out of it , " says Fischbach . <p> Alarm systems now include cameras with web-streaming and two-way microphones , provided by the same companies that offer phone , television and Internet connections . <p> Along with the fisheye webcams built into most computer monitors , new " smart " televisions have them embedded into the sets , allowing for interactive TV shows and video telephone calls , much like the wall screens described by Ray Bradbury in his dystopic novel , Farenheit 451 . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner knowing about it , allowing hackers to watch people in their homes . <p> One school district in Philiadelphia was even caught remotely activating webcams on school-supplied laptops , peering at students in their bedrooms and snapping pictures of sleeping teens . <p> " Over the last four years , U.K. local councils have spend 550 million pounds on CCTV cameras . Just local council cameras , we have 51,000 of them , not counting central government , police and transport , " says Emma Carr , spokeswoman for Big Brother Watch in the U.K. <p> " It 's very much a generational divide . The younger generation have become desensitized to these cameras because we have grown up with them , watching us all of the time - in London , on average , you are caught 300 times a day on a camera . " <p> In the U.S. , cities are installing video cameras in public spaces that can read text from hundreds of feet away . <p> Other cameras , being installed in New Jersey , zoom in and record when two people come close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> " London has talking cameras . We are about to deploy light-projecting cameras , " East Orange police Chief William Robinson says . <p> The cameras can shoot a beam a full city block away . <p> " The message to the criminals is : the police are observing you , the police are recording you and the police are responding . " <p> Some people find that disturbing . <p> " That is the definition of Orwellian , " says Cavoukian . " Living in a free and democratic society means that you can walk about freely , not being concerned that every act you engage in is being monitored . And if you are a law-abiding citizen , it is your right not to be monitored on a 24-7 basis . " <p> In the air and everywhere : <p> In George Orwell 's 1984 , the protagonist , Winston Smith , gets away from totalitarian prying eyes for an afternoon , resting in the forest with his secret love . When a bird lands nearby and starts singing , he wonders : " What made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour its music into nothingness ? He wondered whether , after all , there was a microphone hidden somewhere near . " <p> Today , that very bird could be the microphone and camera . <p> The Nano Hummingbird looks like a feathered friend , but it 's really a flapping robot , remote-controlled and armed with a live streaming camera and microphone . <p> Funded by the Defence Advance Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) for the U.S. military , it is one of many new biomimetic robots : machines that look like spiders , insects , birds and snakes , with cameras for eyes and microphones for ears . <p> The U.S. military hopes to make a " pigeon " that recharges itself using its metal talons when landing on power lines . <p> Researchers at Cornell University and the University of Michigan are also turning real insects into cyborgs , using electrodes to control the flight of moths and beetles . <p> " What we expected surveillance to look like and where we expect it to be is no longer the case , " Murakami Wood says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technologies . Just when we thought we got a handle on it , suddenly they are n't what they thought they would be . " <p> Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania have created small robots that fly in formation . Like a disciplined swarm of dragon flies , they can navigate through windows and doors .
