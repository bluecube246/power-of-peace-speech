<h> Celebrating The Holidays With Oil On Whyte <p> Deck the halls and all of that . The NHL 's current lockout is approaching day 100 , leaving fans in a predictably sour mood . But turn the other cheek , it 's the holiday season . Time for toys , and time for cheer . <p> We here at Oil On Whyte industries have carefully selected gift ideas for various members of the NHL/NHLPA . I hope everyone gets what they wanted . <p> NHLPA Executive Director Donald Fehr -- It has n't been an especially good week for Donald Fehr . The NHLPA voted by an overwhelming margin to authorize a de-certifcation ( although it has n't yet happened ) , and like Bettman , Fehr 's image wo n't improve as long as the lockout drags on . Fehr really looks like he could use a pick-me-up . Gifts should be thoughtful and practical , so Donald Fehr receives a one hour consultation with motivational speaker Matt Foley . He 'll be back on track in no time . <p> Who else do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an abbreviated NHL campaign . Going all in and predicting that half a season will be salvaged . Getting 35 points as the Oilers ' 3C might be a lofty number , but it would help quiet some of his detractors . <p> Taylor Hall and Ales Hemsky -- Healthy shoulders . Robotic shoulder implants . Extra shoulders on the bench , in case one needs to be replaced . The answer is shoulders . <p> Linus Omark -- A plane ticket . Guy will have an NHL job when the lockout ends . Omark has 45 points ( 13-32-45 ) in 31 games with Zug , which is n't exactly chicken scratch . He 's worthy of more than what he 'll be traded for . If he turns into a 50 point player with Henrik Zetterberg , we 'll get to hear about how he was bad in the locker room , or did n't " buy into the message " ( or some other rhetoric ) , or that he is n't an NHL player , or that he does n't like soup , or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract . I ca n't think of anything else that guy needs right now , maybe some snow tires ? Probably not , he 's in Anaheim . Good on him . <p> Nikolai Khabibulin -- A streak like he had in October of 2011 . By far , his finest hour while a member of the Oilers.
