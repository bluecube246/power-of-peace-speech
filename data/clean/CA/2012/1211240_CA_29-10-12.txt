<p> Reza Satchu sold his first startup -- a supply-chain software company -- at the height of the dot-com boom , for just shy of $1-billion . <p> Since then , the Harvard Business School grad , who spent 12 years at the private equity firm Fenway Partners in New York , has made a name for himself as one of the crustiest -- and best -- business professors at the University of Toronto , a mentor for young entrepreneurs , and a savvy investor through his Alignvest Capital Management fund . <h> Startups <h> Expert Advice <p> And he 's got some tough words for Canada when it comes to entrepreneurship . <p> Q : You moved to Canada from Kenya when you were seven . What was that like ? <p> A : The decision to move to Canada was a remarkable opportunity , and it changed our lives . But at the time , it was difficult . I immediately skipped a grade , so the combination of having a funny accent , being younger , and having parents who did n't have us immersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that discomfort led to some confidence in overcoming obstacles . <p> Q : What did you learn from your dad ? <p> A : My dad started off as a real estate agent and built up his own business . So we saw in a tangible way -- moving from a small townhouse to a slightly bigger one -- that progression of hard work and taking some risk . That instilled some level of confidence and a strong set of expectations . And we learned not to be scared of taking risks . <p> Q : How did that pay off ? <p> A : When I decided I wanted to go to Wall Street , I probably got rejected 200 times . Then , instead of going to an established private equity firm , I went to a startup -- Fenway Partners . I was the third person there , and it became very successful . I got a taste of being an entrepreneur . My wife and I both had massive loans , but our decision to not play it safe and to get some equity instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first startup , SupplierMarket.com . <p> A : It was a supply-chain software company focused on procuring direct materials faster for manufacturing firms . Things were somewhat crazed on the tech side when my brother and I started in 1998 . I was 29 , my brother was 27 , and we raised money from Onex , KKR and Sequoia . Neither of us knew anything about technology . How did we raise money from all these sophisticated investors ? I like to say they all looked across the table and saw two Indian kids , and just assumed we knew something about technology . <p> Q : How did you end up selling it to Ariba for $925-million ? <p> A : We had about 250 people , and we were scheduled to go public . The best decision we made was selling . That was against the wishes of the board . Everyone we talked to would say , " Do n't sell , go public . " Only with us threatening to resign did the board listen . Now that looks like a good decision . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed absurd not to take that price . There are many more stories of people who did n't take that kind of price . <p> Q : What are some of the key lessons you taught in your economics for entrepreneurs class at the University of Toronto ? <p> A : One , seek positions of discomfort . Work on your weaknesses . Put yourself in situations where you are forced to get better at them . Only in positions of discomfort do you learn a lot . Two , when I went down to Wall Street , I remember thinking that the kids from Harvard , Yale and Stanford must be much smarter -- they certainly acted it . The truth is , they 're no better educated , but they have two advantages : massive access to leaders and mentors , and , because of that , massively expanded goalposts . I encourage people to find mentors , so you can touch and feel it , and have a set of expectations that get you there . Three , for Canada to stay relevant , we have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe in fate at all . Very few entrepreneurs would say that whatever happens was meant to happen . I think that 's BS . <p> Q : Why do n't we have more entrepreneurial successes here ? <p> A : This is true , not a myth : In Canada , when people fail , you might as well put an X on your face and never come out again . The consequence is that people do n't try . But trying and failing is so much better than not trying at all , because at least you learn something . <p> A : If you look at the 10 largest businesses created over the past 15 years , most of them have been created by people in their twenties -- people like Michael Dell and Mark Zuckerberg . The world has changed . You do n't need grey hair and 30 years of experience to make something happen . The time to get people on the right track , where we can have the most impact , is early in their careers . We go through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to The Next 36 program , because they 're getting more in terms of resources and mentorship . We focus on undergraduates because we want to catch the Canadians whom we can have major impact on and who have n't left yet -- because if you 're at Rotman or Ivey , it means that you did n't get into Stanford or Harvard . We want people we can truly transform . <p> Q : What do you look for when investing in businesses through your fund , Alignvest Capital Management ? <p> A : Our business is both starting and investing with people who have vision . The most important thing we look for is the actual person who 's leading the investment . I 'm looking for someone I can trust . You 're going to see 100 business plans that are gon na be pointing at the sky from 0 to a billion . But there will always be lots of bumps in the road , so we 're looking for someone who has conviction and a sense of responsibility that , when you take my money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're going to work their ass off . Why did people invest in SupplierMarket.com ? It was n't just because we were Indian . It was because every single person who had worked with my brother or I , from analysts at Merrill Lynch on up , had invested in us . They said , " We 've worked with them , and they 're really good guys . " I 've got multiple screens on how to evaluate people , but that is what 's most important <p> Q : What 's your advice for budding entrepreneurs ? <p> A : You 've got to put yourself in a situation where luck and proportionality can impact you . If you 're a lawyer and you get lucky , you work 50 hours and make a bit more money . If you 're an entrepreneur and you work harder , it could be a complete sea change . <p> Q : What 's the biggest mistake an entrepreneur can make ? <p> A : The death of so many entrepreneurs is because they focus on maximizing their valuation when raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price so they can keep the most equity . But you get what you pay for -- you 're raising money from the dumbest people . We went to really sophisticated investors who were going to keep more equity , but who increased our probability of success . Do n't think of it as just a cash investment ; think of it as taking on a partner who can be a very important part of the business . <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .
