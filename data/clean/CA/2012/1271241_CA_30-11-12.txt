thunder bay -- there is a debate raging in great britain over the relationship between the press and the police and politicians . speaking in the british house of commons , prime minister cameron stated , " lord justice leveson makes clear that he does n't find a basis for challenging the integrity of the police . but he does raise a number of areas which he felt were a cause for public concern such as tip-offs , off-the-record briefings and more broadly , " excessive proximity " between the press and the police " .  the scandal that led to the inquiry was allegations that members of the british press , specifically ' news of the world ' had ' hacked ' into the wireless phones of celebrities and reported on what they had found . the newspaper has since been shut down by the owners of the company . news international announced the shuttering of the newspaper on 7 july 2011 .  the ongoing scandal has yet to fully play out , and there are potential legal implications still to come forward . cameron said , " as lord justice leveson has found ' over the last 30-35 years and probably much longer , the political parties of uk national government and uk official opposition , have had or developed too close a relationship with the press in a way that has not been in the public interest ' " .  " i made this point last summer when i set up this inquiry -- and at the same time i set in train reforms to improve transparency , " cameron continued . " this is the first government ever to publish details of meetings between senior politicians and proprietors , editors or senior executives , as lord justice leveson recommends in his report . he also recommends disclosing further information on the overall level of interaction between politicians and the press " .  " this would apply to all parties -- and on the government 's behalf i can say that we accept that recommendation , " added cameron .  cameron adds , " he makes a number of recommendations including national guidance on appropriate gifts and hospitality ; record-keeping a 12-month ' cooling-off ' period for senior police officers being employed by the press . these are designed to break the perception of an excessively cosy relationship between the press and the police and we support these recommendations " .
