<h> Bourgeois to the rescue as investors take stranglehold on broomball final <p> Lance Ereaut , right , of Investors Group , attempts to knock the ball away from West Side Monarchs Cory Rideout in game two of the best-of- five Corner Brook Molson Mens Broomball League final at the Pepsi Centre . <p> CORNER ? BROOK Eric Bourgeois had a " Connor Crisp " ? moment on Monday night . <p> Investors Group goalkeeper Bob ? Beck was knocked into by a West Side ? Monarchs forward during the first shift of Game 2 of the Corner Brook Molson Men 's Broomball ? League 's best-of-three final at the Pepsi Centre . The lower-body injury forced him out of the game and the investors were left looking for answers . <p> Earlier this month , in the Ontario ? Hockey League , a similar situation arose when the ? Erie Otters lost starting goalie Ramis Sadikov on the same type of play . Connor Crisp , a forward who had n't played all season was asked to be the emergency goalie . He went on to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of the game . <p> It could be argued Bourgeois was also the first star for his team , but it certainly was n't any kind of pity vote , as he was successful in backstopping the investors to a 3-2 overtime win and a 2-0 lead in the series . <p> Michael ? Hawco was the overtime hero , though he was overshadowed somewhat by the mystery man behind the mask down at the other end . Lance Ereaut and Rick Kean also scored for the investors . <p> Geoff Byrne and Eric ( Sticky ) Young responded for the Monarchs . <p> For Bourgeois -- a five-year veteran of the sport , but first-time goalkeeper -- it could n't have gone much better . <p> " The boys played really well in front of me , " ? he said . " I ? guess obviously they knew not to let too much through ... I ? probably only faced 10 or 12 shots on net because the boys were blocking lots of shots in front of me . They were making the extra effort on defence knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it became clear the Monarchs smelled blood as soon as he stepped between the posts . <p> " The ( Monarchs ) are smart players and I ? guess they probably said ' let 's throw everything on net and let 's see what happens , ' " ? said ? Bourgeois . " They were throwing balls at me from the corner , trying to get rebounds . One of their goals was a rebound goal like that . " <p> Though Bourgeois had experience playing in goal during friendly ball hockey games , he said there were a few things to get used to right away during a broomball game . <p> " The big net is a bit scary , I looked back and the net is almost over my head , " ? he said . " The ball travels a lot slower too ... you almost react to it too fast if you have room to see it coming from far out . A hockey ball goes twice as fast . " <p> His emergence may be a blessing in disguise for the investors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive defensive meltdown in the second half . They were forced to focus on playing well in their own end Monday night and that should carry over to Game 3 next week . <p> " Everyone was taking their man and keeping shots to the outside , we just waited for our chances because we 've got enough skill up front and on defence to do that , " ? said Bourgeois . " We want to close it out . " <p> And he may very well be back in the crease as the last line of defence . <p> " I ? do n't know yet , " ? he laughed . " It looks like I ? could be going for my second win of the year next week .
