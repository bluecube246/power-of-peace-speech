<p> Have you ever looked at a remarkable photo and wished you could hear the story behind it ? Good . Keep reading . <p> Trying to find the year 's best photos is a bit of a fool 's game . The world never stops producing moments that are exciting , terrifying , morbid , heartbreaking and awe-inspiring . And photographers never stop capturing those moments . You could fill countless magazines with breathtaking images . Maclean 's dedicated an entire issue packed with 2012 's finest photography . Below are the stories behind five of those photos . They come from all over , just like the photographers who shot them . Enjoy . <h> JONATHAN HAYWARD ( CP ) Sicamous , B.C. <p> Jonathan Hayward , who lives in Vancouver , got the call to cover flash floods near Sicamous , B.C. on June 24 . The next day , after a six-hour drive that got him to within minutes of the flooded area , Hayward found Highway 97A -- a road washed out in two places -- blocked to traffic . The friendly Newfoundlander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little guy " chatted up locals about how to get to the scene of the floods . Eventually , Hayward found a man willing to get him there by boat -- but it came at a cost . <p> " It 's funny . You ask how much is a boat ride to see the damage , " he recalls . " The guy 's like , ' Well , would a two-four of beer work ? ' " <p> Hayward could n't turn down that offer , and off they went . Once the boat docked , he wandered around the area and , before too long , came across the house teetering into a riverbed . He was the first photographer to get the shot . <p> Before he was posted in B.C. , Hayward spent 10 years in Ottawa -- a much more benign assignment , as far as natural disasters go . " It was quite eye opening , " he said . <h> DANIEL OCHOA DE OLZA ( AP ) Pamplona , Spain <p> Daniel Ochoa de Olza tries to shoot the Running of the Bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and knows the terrain intimately -- he ran with the bulls when he was a teenager , and eventually started taking photos . <p> This year , De Olza perched on a balcony that overlooks the final stretch of the run , a narrow space where , he says , inexperienced tourists ca n't escape the charging beasts as they round a tight corner . That can make for astounding images . <p> " As soon as I realized the Japanese guy in the photo was not really that fast , I thought the bull might chase him and gore him , so I shot a series of photos , " de Olza said . " I was lucky enough to get some pictures , and the Japanese guy was lucky enough not to be gored . " <p> That particular tourist got lucky , only suffering minor injuries . De Olza sent him emails afterwards , trying to send him some photos -- all to no avail . " I think he was a bit ashamed of all the exposure , " said de Olza . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing else . " <h> FRANK GUNN ( CP ) Niagara Falls , Ont . <p> Frank Gunn stood on top of the Skylon Tower as Nik Wallenda crossed Niagara Falls on a tightrope . He was part of a gaggle of photographers tasked with shooting photos of the daredevil 's long walk . They all shared the same vantage point on that clear evening , and Gunn wanted his photos to stand out . So he got creative . <p> " You needed to show the power of Niagara Falls . I shot it a bit like a nature photo , " he said , explaining that he shot with a two-second exposure that captured the movement of the waterfall . " Whenever you shoot a picture of water , you typically try to do a long exposure so the water paints . That 's why it 's all billowy , as opposed to being crisp . " <p> Wallenda never stopped moving , so Gunn slowly panned his camera throughout the exposure , following Wallenda and keeping his frame intact . No one else captured it the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the action -- hundreds of metres , by Gunn 's estimate -- it was almost like watching the stunt on television , he said . " It was very much like theatre . " <h> JOHN MINCHILLO ( AP ) New York , N.Y . <p> John Minchillo was in Lower Manhattan when Sandy 's storm surge raced ashore . He was standing on a bridge overlooking the flooded Brooklyn -- Battery Tunnel , when Governor Andrew Cuomo showed up beside him . <p> So Minchillo followed him around . <p> " Cuomo probably has more information than me on things that are happening , because he has a whole crew of people who are trying to figure out where to take him next , " he said . <p> A few minutes later , when Cuomo entered the World Trade Center site , Minchillo followed and started snapping photos of the flooding . " I was n't photographing him at that point , because the story is the storm , and not politics , " he said . " I had to be very focused on getting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph in darkness . " <p> Minchillo guesses he worked over 20 hours when Sandy hit the city . " It had to be . You do n't leave the story , " he said . <p> For his part , however , Minchillo does n't want to be known as " the guy who took the crazy photograph and defied the odds . " Far from it . " I 'm just a journalist like everybody else , " he said . <h> RODRIGO ABD ( AP ) Caracas , Venezuela <p> Rodrigo Abd was riding on the back of a motorcycle when , out of nowhere , he spotted a man 's head peeking out of a deep puddle at the side of the road . As it turned out , that man was a city worker attempting to repair a burst pipe . Abd saw more than a piece of crumbling infrastructure , however . <p> He 'd been sent to Caracas , Venezuela 's capital city , to cover the election campaign for the Associated Press . He witnessed quite a bit of tension : Hugo Chavez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious ; the election campaign had dragged on ; and , to top it off , the economy was sputtering . <p> " In a way , the photo was a good metaphor of what Venezuelans were facing at that moment , " he said . " Even the most hardcore Chavistas ... really feared that their leader was going to be defeated . " <p> Abd had no assignment in particular that day , and was only a few blocks from the AP office in downtown Caracas when he stumbled upon the burst pipe . <p> " I jumped from the motorcycle and started taking pictures , " he said , adding he had no idea the picture would make its way around the world . <h> Advertisement <h> Post navigation <h> Every photographer tells a story <p> The back story is as fascinating as the photo . When I saw the photo of the tourist in the running of the bulls , I winced and then wondered how the photographer managed the shot . Thanks for the explanation .
