" He has indicated that it may turn out to be " the greatest heist in the history of Brazil " . <p> Romario , the soccer player <p> Romario de Souza Faria , a.k.a . Rom ? rio or O Baixinho ( Portuguese for " Shorty " , because of his height ) is a former Brazilian footballer who played for several top Brazilian soccer teams . He has also played for PSV Eindhoven in Netherlands , for FC Barcelona and FC Valencia in Spain , Al-Sadd SC of Qatar , and for Miami FC in the USA . He helped the Brazilian national team achieve victory at the 1994 FIFA World Cup and has been one of the all-time top scorers in the sport , only comparable to Brazil 's Pel ? and Ronaldo , and to Diego Maradona of Argentina ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least twice , in 2008 and 2009 , and in 2010 he got involved in Brazilian federal politics , running for election as a member of the Chamber of Deputies in the Brazilian Socialist Party list . He was elected with the sixth largest vote in the state of Rio de Janeiro . <p> Romario , the politician <p> As a politician Romario has been largely concerned about his country 's preparations to host the 2014 FIFA World <p> Cup . In several occasions he has criticised the level of preparation of the country for the important international event , particularly in connection with the expected date of completion of several stadiums and in the organization and readiness of the ground transportation systems in several cities . <p> In recent days Romario has hardened his rhetoric and accused Dilma Rousseff , the Brazilian president , and Joseph Blatter , the president of the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) of deceiving Brazilians about how well the preparatory work is progressing . Last week Rousseff and Blatter had a meeting to evaluate progress to which congressmen were not invited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Dilma is being deceived or is letting people deceive her , ' ' Romario said . " It will be the greatest heist in the history of Brazil . Then I 'll want to see if the people who were smiling in the photograph in that meeting will want to show up again . Brazil is a circus and you already know who the clowns are . ' ' he added . <p> Romario has been an outspoken critic of the preparatory work carried out so far complaining about serious overspending and misuse of public funds . He insists that important work that should be going on right now is being purposely delayed until it becomes " emergency work " , thus obviating the need for tenders and a regular bidding process . <p> Romario 's " glass roof " <p> The 2014 FIFA World Cup may result a complete success , or possibly a great disaster , and Deputy Romario may end up being right . Unfortunately , Deputy Romario 's personal reputation and credibility are not all that great .

In addition to the great praise he has received for his exploits on the soccer field , O Baixinho has often been in the press because of wrongdoings . During his soccer career he was also known for his love of nightlife , absences from training , unruly behavior , failing a doping test , and frequent fights . <p> In 2005 Romario was ordered to pay US$ 22,200 to former soccer player Zico ( Arthur Antunes Coimbra ) as compensation for " moral damage " when he used Zico 's image on the doors of toilets in a bar he was operating in Rio de Janeiro . In 2009 he was in prison for defaulting on child support payments , and in the same year he was sentenced to three and half years in prison and a fine of US$ 890,000 for failure to declare income and tax evasion . His sentence was reduced on appeal to two and a half years of community service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his flaws , the fact is that Deputy Romario holds , along with another showman , Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva ( a.k.a . Clown Tiririca ) , a seat in Brazil 's Federal Congress . After being elected in Sao Paulo State with the highest national vote , Deputy Oliveira was able to fend off accusations of illiteracy by obtaining 30% in a simple test and demonstrating that he could read and write , thus keeping his post as a Federal Deputy . <p> Still , we must assume that Brazilians accept as true that federal politics and the organization of the 2014 FIFA World Cup are in good hands .
