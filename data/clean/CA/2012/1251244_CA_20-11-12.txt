Sections  Let 's talk about sex ( and people with disabilities ) , say advocates  Lynda Roy , health promoter , therapist and co-ordinator of the SexAbility program at the Anne Johnston Health Station , poses for a photo in Toronto on Tuesday , November 20 , 2012 . Photo : THE CANADIAN PRESS/Michelle Siu  TORONTO -- People with disabilities face any number of challenges , but perhaps the most insidious is society 's unspoken belief that they are somehow asexual beings -- neither wanting nor able to express that most universal of human needs .  It is a notion decidedly debunked by the film " The Sessions , " based on the true story of a man paralyzed by childhood polio and mostly confined to an iron lung , who at age 38 longs to experience sexual intimacy for the first time in his life .  The poignant story of writer-poet Mark O'Brien , played by John Hawkes , and his carnal awakening under the tutelage of a sex surrogate portrayed by Helen Hunt , should go a long way to , advocates say .  " The big one is this idea that people with disabilities are not sexual -- not only that they literally can not have sex , but also that they 're not sexually desirable and that they do n't desire sex , " says Cory Silverberg , a Canadian sexuality educator working in New York City .  Silverberg says the tendency is to view sex as two people sweeping each other off their feet , " and certainly not between two people where one person might actually have to lift somebody onto the bed , because that 's not seen as sexy . "  Unfortunately , he says , such stereotypical thinking gets absorbed by those whose physical abilities may be limited , sometimes severely , by any of a range of conditions , among them spinal cord injury , cerebral palsy , muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis .  " Often people with disabilities will say ' I 'm not going to come to your workshop because I 've never had sex , I 'm not sexual . ' And of course , that a lifetime of being told , but not explicitly .  " The trap is you begin to think that it 's just you . "  Surrounded by images of leggy models and A-list celebrities that shape society 's definition of sexual attractiveness , it 's no wonder people with disabilities struggle with body image and are sometimes reticent about physical intimacy , says Sandra Mills , a patient and family educator at Toronto Rehab 's Lyndhurst Centre for spinal cord injury .  " When stereotypes and prejudices exist already and then you try to connect that with a disability , it makes it challenging for a person who acquires a disability to re-engage in a physical world , in a world of dating and socializing , " she says .  Rich Vanderwal , 41 , says his self-image took a severe blow after a motorcycle crash 20 years ago left him paralyzed below his armpits . He has mobility in his arms and hands but is reliant on a wheelchair to get around .  A ski and snowboard instructor during winter and a lifeguard in summer had been built around his athletic ability and once-buff physique .  " I was known as the guy who took my shirt off and I had abs . I was proud of them because to me that was a sign of fitness and , of course , sexuality and all those things . "  Despite his life-changing injury , Vanderwal has continued to embrace sports , playing high-level wheelchair tennis , downhill ski racing and rowing . Last year , he competed in an Ironman half-triathlon using special equipment .  He also put himself out there in the dating world .  Vanderwal says he always had a lot of female friends " and as luck and circumstance would have it , I started to become more intimate with these people who were already close in my social circle . "  " That gave me a chance to kind of investigate what might be possible and my new comfort levels and how my new body was going to handle different situations . "  Then he met Carole Chebaro , at the time a volunteer at Lyndhurst friends , then began dating . Six years ago , Vanderwal and Chebaro married .  Early on in their relationship , Vanderwal says he worried about whether he was meeting all of Chebaro 's needs . " But it 's very clear that I could meet some of the important ones . "  The couple hopes to soon start a family .  Vanderwal says he has tried medications like Viagra and can have intercourse " to a certain quality , " but for the most part orgasm is not through intercourse and is " modified and different now . "  " There 's no actual physical sensation , but all the chemical changes within the body still go on . I still get the flushing of the face , there 's that euphoric feeling and certain relaxations . "  One welcome reaction is a quieting down of persistent muscle spasms , a common repercussion of spinal cord damage . " A lot of my spasticity , which is there 24-7 -- literally my spasticity is firing off every 15 seconds all day and all night -- I 'm completely relaxed , " he says .  The ability to move or feel sensations below the site of a spinal cord injury may be lost or disrupted , depending on the extent of damage , explains Mills .  Even so , people with such injuries can " absolutely " experience sexual intimacy , she says .  " A lot of times , the person will develop new erogenous zones above the level of injury . So people will report that their ears and the back of their necks or their nipples are so sensitive , like crazy off-the-scale sensitive , that it sends them into an erotic tailspin .  " It actually can trigger an orgasm in a different sense . Orgasms are half mental . So the orgasm comes from these erogenous zones , but happens in the brain . "  Gratification also often comes from satisfying the partner without a disability , adds Mills . " It 's in seeing the joy and the relief and the orgasm in their partner that really brings out a whole new sense of meaning to her husband Bobby , sexuality is all about intimacy , not intercourse .  In 1996 at age 24 , Kaiser suffered a spinal cord injury in a car crash that left her a quadriplegic with some arm movement . The Richmond Hill , Ont. , couple had been dating for about six years and married three years after her accident .  Sex raised a number of difficulties : Kaiser has what 's called autonomic dysreflexia , a response by the body to stimulus below the injury site that can cause dangerously high blood pressure , a slowed heart rate , even seizures .  As well , her husband was hesitant about sexual intimacy because of her loss of sensation and movement . " It felt weird to him . He felt almost in a sense that he was taking advantage of me . It 's like , ' I feel it and therefore I 'm getting pleasure , but if you do n't feel it , you 're not . '  " We just chose not to be sexually active in that sense and our activity was the cuddling and affection and that sort of thing . "  Many people , Kaiser suggests , are surprised that an able-bodied person would even consider being in a relationship and physically intimate with a partner who has a disability . " In some cases , they think people with disabilities would only be with other people with disabilities .  " And that 's another big misconception : people do n't realize that people with disabilities can actually get pregnant and have kids and be parents , and be very successful and capable parents , " says Kaiser , whose four-year-old daughter Olivia was conceived through insemination with her husband 's sperm .  Vanderwal says while the body may change with a spinal injury or as the result of a disabling disease , one 's likes , dislikes , interests and desires remain intact .  " It does n't matter what body you 're in . Your mind and your thoughts , it 's a natural process to have attraction and want to share that sexual energy with somebody else .  " So it 's perfectly just the healthy , good-looking Hollywood-type people that are in our society . "  People with disabilities face any number of challenges , but perhaps the most insidious is society 's unspoken belief that they are somehow asexual beings -- neither wanting nor able to express that most universal of human needs .
