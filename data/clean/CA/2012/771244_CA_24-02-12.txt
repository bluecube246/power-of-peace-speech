David Cavanagh ( above ) originally faced a manslaughter charge in the death of Eric Osawe ( inset ) during Unit , an arm's-length agency that investigates reports involving police where there has been death , serious injury or allegations of sexual assault , laid the charge in consultation with the Crown .  It 's the first time a Toronto police officer has been charged with murder for an on-the-job incident and it sends a " very disturbing message " to police , said Toronto Police Association president Mike McCormack .  " To suggest that an officer performing his duties executing a search warrant with a team would have intent to murder somebody is absolutely appalling , " he said .  " We 've lost confidence in the Crown attorneys ' office and the SIU for our members to be treated fairly and impartially . "  The Emergency Task Force and guns and gangs unit were searching an apartment in the city 's west end on Sept. 29 , 2010 , when the SIU alleges Cavanagh shot Osawe .  He was shot in the back , said Julian Falconer , the family 's lawyer .  Osawe 's close-knit family has been distraught over his death will be asked at a murder trial , Falconer said .  " The charge that Const . Cavanagh is facing is very serious so it 's not a day for celebration , " he said .  Cavanagh 's lawyer questioned why the charge was upgraded , saying as far as the defence knows there is no new evidence .  " There has been no adequate explanation given to the defence , " said Peter Brauti .  McCormack is concerned the charge will have a chilling effect on police officers .  He said he has already heard comments to that effect from some of them .  " We have to know that when we 're making split-second decisions and taking action ... that our actions will be judged fairly and this clearly indicates to my members that they wo n't be , " McCormack said .  Cavanagh is free on bail and his preliminary inquiry is scheduled for Oct. 1 .
