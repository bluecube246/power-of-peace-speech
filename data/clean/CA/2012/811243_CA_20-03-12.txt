<h> New brown trout fishing opportunity for Cape Breton anglers <p> The 2012 general sport fishing season will open in most parts of Cape Breton on April 1 and this year Cape Breton anglers will be able to take advantage of an extended season for brown trout in the Bras d'Or Lake . <p> This year anglers will be able to fish brown trout year around in the areas open for rainbow trout . The bag limit will be a total of two fish of either species during the period from Oct. 1 to March 31 . <p> Every year I hear of more anglers fishing for and catching brown trout . This is no surprise when you consider how well they have adapted to our waters . Brown trout , known scientifically as salmo trutta , are not native to North America . Their natural range is Europe . First introduced in Nova Scotia in 1923 , in the Milford Haven River of Guysborough County , brown trout have become well established in several areas of Cape Breton . Since the first fish stocks which were imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to them as German browns . Later stocks came from Loch Leven in Scotland so some strains were referred to as Loch Leven trout . <p> As their name suggests , brown trout are brown or golden brown in colour . They grow rapidly , and can reach some impressive sizes . In Europe fish up to 68 pounds have been caught while a sea run brown trout weighing 28 pounds was caught in Witless Bay , Newfoundland in 1962 . <p> Brown trout are generally found in the same habitats as brook trout but due to their larger size , and their ability to tolerate higher water temperatures , they often displace brook trout from their range . Brown trout tend to seek out deep holes under banks and overhanging trees or anywhere there is some cover . These fish lie low during the day and become active at night . Fishing them at dusk can be very productive , and exciting . <p> Anglers living in Cape Breton are fortunate in having a wide selection of brown trout fishing opportunities to choose from . Two top areas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced two current Nova Scotia record brown trout . An 18.4 pound fish caught by Charlie Lahey in 2007 , which is the top brown trout in the catch and keep category , and a fish which measured 21.5 inches caught by Pat Young in 2009 is the leader in the live release category . <p> In addition to resident trout these areas also have sea run populations of brown trout which makes for fast action during the annual run . These sea run fish have spent several seasons feeding in the food-rich coastal areas and can reach some impressive sizes . <p> Fishing for brown trout can sometimes make for challenging angling . Early in the season spinning gear with worms or minnows can be very successful . Later on in the summer when the water drops they can be very selective in what they eat . The exception is in the evening when the big browns go on the prowl . These big trout pretty well eat everything that swims so a big muddler minnow or mouse imitation can trigger some violent strikes . <p> Tight Lines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Cape Breton Anglers dinner and auction being held this year at the Cape Breton Exhibition grounds on May 5 .
