Houston RBI has been serving Houston area youth since 1997 with a variety of summer and fall baseball and softball programs , assistance with SAT preparation and mentoring of high school and college bound students . ( Dave Einsel For The Globe and Mail ) <p> 100th Grey Cup <h> Where are they now : Mike Holmes , from the gridiorn to the diamond Add to ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . They come because Mike Holmes takes them in and makes them better , makes them whole . It 's a gift , he says in a soothing voice . Only he is n't talking about himself . <p> The gift is the program he runs , one that would have slipped away due to bureaucracy and budget cuts if it had n't been for the former Winnipeg Blue Bombers receiver . <h> Interactive timeline <h> On Tour in T.O . <p> Officially , Holmes is the president of Houston RBI . RBI stands for Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities , a community endeavour sponsored in part by Major League Baseball . <p> To make it work , to give young teenagers a positive outlet so they can pursue their baseball dreams , Holmes does more than oversee a 20-member board . He helps manage the teens on-field . He organizes schedules and trips . He raises money to make sure there are enough uniforms and equipment for everyone to play . <p> " The City of Houston used to run the program , " Holmes said , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city decided to do away with it . I took it over and I 've been running it ever since . We 've put 160 kids through to college . We have nine players in the majors . It 's a lot of fun . " <p> Three of Holmes 's prot ? g ? s have played in the All-Star Game : Carl Crawford of the Los Angeles Dodgers , the MVP of the 2009 game ; Chris Young of the Oakland Athletics in 2010 ; Michael Bourn of the Atlanta Braves in 2012 . <p> Bourn was baseball 's top base-stealer in 2011 , and is a two-time Gold Glove winner . All three players are outfielders . <p> " From a baseball perspective , those are the guys I really feel good about , " Holmes said . <p> So how does a former football player , one who played in three different professional leagues , end up offering baseball-loving teens a safe haven from gangs and drugs ? <p> A native Texan , Holmes loved baseball , played basketball and was offered a football scholarship at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education and wound up a first-round pick in the 1973 NFL draft ( 18th overall by the San Francisco 49ers ) as a defensive back . After two seasons with the 49ers , he was released and he closed out 1976 with the Miami Dolphins . He given a choice : either hang around and wait for a shot in Miami or play in Winnipeg as a receiver . <p> He went north and never regretted it . <p> With the Blue Bombers , Holmes played in an offence that featured fellow receivers Eugene Goodlow , Joe Poplawski and Rick House and quarterback Dieter Brock . In six seasons , Holmes caught 244 passes for 3,752 yards and 33 touchdowns . In 1980 , he was a CFL all-star . <p> " In Winnipeg , the Red River Exhibition would always roll into town during the season , and Mike was intrigued by one of the rides , " former Blue Bombers linebacker Leo Ezerins said . <p> " In practice , he would yell out during pass patterns : ' Do you want to go faster ? ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try to catch me . ' Very few did . " <p> Holmes left Winnipeg for two seasons in the U.S. Football League before working for the City of Houston 's parks and recreation department . He helped administrate Houston RBI , which had been patterned after the original program funded by former major-league player and scout John Young in the South Central region of Los Angeles in the late 1980s . <p> When Houston city officials said they could no longer operate it . Holmes jumped in for the simplest of reasons : " If you see something good , you want to be a part of it . Growing up , my middle-school and high-school coach said a lot of positive things that kept me on the right path . It 's my turn to assist someone . " <p> Holmes says 75 per cent of the teens he gets come from broken homes . Many seek a refuge from the violence in their neighbourhood . The boys are divided into two age groups ( 13 to 15 , 16 to 18 ) while girls 18 and older play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the city funded the Houston Astros Urban Youth Academy ( UYA ) , a facility where hundreds of kids have learned about attending university on a baseball scholarship . <p> When the Houston UYA opened , its manager , Daryl Wade , said being able to work with the young players over time would greatly benefit chances of playing elsewhere . <p> For Holmes , it was a glorious day , almost as good as the August afternoon he celebrated in 2010 , when his senior boys ' team travelled to Jupiter , Fla. , and won the RBI World Series . It was the first time in 14 trips that Houston won it all . <p> " James Loney Boston Red Sox came from our program . Jason Bourgeois Kansas City Royals . Quinten Davis drafted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2012 , " Holmes says . " It 's like I tell all the kids : ' Set yourself a goal and do n't stop until you reach that goal . ' <p> " I enjoyed football , but this is what I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
