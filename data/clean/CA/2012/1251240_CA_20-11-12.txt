The Hobbit : At least 27 animal stars die on unsafe farm  Wellington - " The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey " is due to premiere in Wellington , New Zealand on November 28 . However , in the meantime a scandal has arisen over the treatment of animals used in the film .  While according to the American Humane Association , the animals were not harmed during the actual filming of the movie , wranglers involved in the film say that poor accommodation and treatment away from the set has resulted in the deaths of at least 27 animals .  The wranglers complained that the conditions at the farm , which housed 150 animals for the film , were unsuitable . They named " bluffs , sinkholes and broken-down fencing " as among the most troubling " death traps " for the animals , many of which died of severe injuries .  According to one wrangler , over time he buried three horses , as well as about six goats , six sheep and a dozen chickens . Apparently two more horses An Unexpected Journey  YouTube  A miniature horse called Rainbow , slated to appear as a Hobbit horse , was apparently the first to go and was euthanized after breaking his back when he crash-landed on the uneven terrain .  Another wrangler said that a horse named Claire was discovered dead , her head underwater in a stream , after falling over a bluff . Two other horses were injured after their legs were ripped open on some fencing .  And yet , despite their complaints , the farm continued to be used by the producers of the film .  Spokesperson for director Peter Jackson has officially confirmed that several horses , goats , chickens and one sheep died at the farm near Wellington .  According to the spokesman , Matt Dravitski , some deaths had natural causes , while others could have been avoided if necessary precautions had been taken timeously . Dravitzki claims that the production company did react immediately after two horses , who could have been saved , died .  " We do know those deaths were avoidable and we took " he said .  " The producers completely reject the accusations that 27 animals died due to mistreatment during the making of the films . Extraordinary measures were taken to make sure that animals were not used during action sequences or any other sequence that might create undue stress for the animals involved . Over 55 percent of all shots using animals in The Hobbit are in fact computer generated ; this includes horses , ponies , rabbits , hedgehogs , birds , deer , elk , mice , wild boars and wolves .  The American Humane Association ( AHA ) was on hand to monitor all use of animals by the production . No animals died or were harmed on set during filming .  We regret that some of these accusations by wranglers who were dismissed from the film over a year ago are only now being brought to our attention . We are currently investigating these new allegations and are attempting to speak with all parties involved to establish the truth . "  Kathy Guillermo , a senior vice president for Animal Rights defenders , the Hobbit had contacted the organization and that PETA sent a letter to Jackson last week outlining the group 's concerns .  " We want to send a clear message to Hollywood that they need to be very careful when using animals and take all the precautions that need to be taken , " Guillermo said .  PETA are planning to rally against the film in New Zealand , the US and the UK , as the first in a $500 million Hobbit trilogy premieres in Wellington on November 28.
