WINNIPEG -- A veteran Manitoba Child and Family Services worker says she faces extreme workplace backlash if Manitoba 's highest court agrees to make public a full transcript of an interview she took part in with lawyers in advance of her testimony at the Phoenix Sinclair inquiry .  " I fear what will happen to me , " Debbie De Gale states in a sworn statement recently filed with the Manitoba Court of Appeal . " I believe that certain co-workers and management from CFS will be upset with me and may react negatively to me , based on what I shared becoming public , " De Gale said .  Tuesday , Justice Marc Monnin granted De Gale the right to present a written case for the court 's consideration . She hopes to keep her pre-interview transcript confidential and available only as a privileged internal document for use and reference by inquiry lawyers .  A group of four CFS authorities and others are battling to see about 12,000 pages of transcripts disclosed and are challenging inquiry Commissioner Ted Hughes 's Aug. 1 decision only created to assist inquiry lawyers in preparing so-called will-say summaries of anticipated witness testimony . The interviews were not conducted under oath .  The court agreed to hear the CFS group 's case on Sept. 7 , putting the kibosh on public testimony at the already-delayed inquiry after 2 1/2 days of public hearings . An appeals court panel will hear arguments Oct. 9 , but it 's unclear when the inquiry will actually resume .  De Gale says she anxiously , but willingly , told inquiry lawyers Derek Olson and Sherri Walsh the truth about her work at Winnipeg CFS and her knowledge of Phoenix 's case in her pre-interview . She has worked for the city child-welfare agency since 1997 .  Key to her case is how she spoke freely after being assured the " word for word " record would remain private .  Essentially , a deal 's a deal , she says .  " I feel that if the transcripts are now disclosed after I was provided the assurances , it is like I was tricked into sharing openly and freely Had I known that the transcript from my interview would ultimately be disclosed , I would have chosen to share far less than I did , " she said .  De Gale , a social worker since 1986 , states her pre-interview was conducted over two days -- broken up by Olson and Walsh , she says , to allow her to hire a lawyer part-way through . The reason , she was told , was because " some of the statements I had made contradicted information provided by other witnesses during their interviews , " she said .  The inquiry 's first phase will examine the services Phoenix Sinclair did or did n't receive from CFS , other circumstances directly related to her 2005 murder at a home on the Fisher River First Nation and why it went undiscovered for months . She was a ward of Child and Family Services for much of her short life , but was not in care when she died .  Phoenix 's mother , Samantha Kematch and her boyfriend , Karl McKay , were convicted in 2008 of first-degree murder @ @ @ @ @
