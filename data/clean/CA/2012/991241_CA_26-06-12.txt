( j.p . moczulski/reuters/j.p . moczulski/reuters )  after a little over a decade at igm financial inc. , could it be time for the parent company of investors group to part ways with mackenzie financial corp. ?  that 's what gmp financial services analyst stephen boland concluded in a recent report after outlining mackenzie 's slow revenue growth and less-than-stellar fund performance , coupled with the growing competition from banks . in the end , his report said that within the next few years there may be an opportunity to " crystallize the value of mackenzie . " or , in plain terms , sell it .  soros fund management chairman george university in budapest , november 3 , 2011 . bernadett szabo/reuters  finance  " while many accretive options are available a potential sale may be worthwhile , " the report said . " we believe that the lack of managers that market to independent advisors would create a premium valuation for mackenzie and significant upside for igm . "  that 's got to be tough news for investors group inc. , which purchased mackenzie in 2001 after an intense bidding war . towards the end of 2000 ci fund management inc. launched an unsolicited $3.9-billion takeover bid for mackenzie . this initial offer was followed by a reported three others ( including one from aic ltd. , now part of manulife financial ) before the bid from investors group was finally accepted by the board on in january of 2001 .  the result of that union was one of the country 's biggest retail wealth management firms--with more than $85-billion in assets under administration , it was more than twice the size of other competitors . the deal was then valued at $4.1-billion .  but while the had been a good get for investors group , the years following the financial crisis have been tough on the company--it has struggled to regain pre-meltdown profitability . " there is considerable pressure on independent asset managers in terms of competition and margin compression , " the report notes .  in addition to this analysis , the report looks at potential bidders for the company who may be interested in entering or expanding in canada , with suggestions primarily leaning towards the big banks and , to a lesser extent , life insurance companies .  it is estimated that a sale today could fetch somewhere between $5-billion and $7-billion from another large asset manager at market . it 's not a show-stopping return , but neither is the firm going to lose money it seems .  the billions from the sale could be used to prop up parent company power financial 's subsidiary pargesa or pay a one-time $20 dividend to shareholders . alternatively , the report suggests using the capital to privatize investors group or fund further global expansion .  restrictions  all rights reserved . framing or similar means , is prohibited without the prior written consent of thomson reuters . thomson reuters is not liable for any errors or delays in thomson reuters content , or for any actions taken in reliance on such content .
