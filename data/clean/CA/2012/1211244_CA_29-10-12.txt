Oil servitude and the new Canadian petrostate : An interview with Andrew Nikiforuk  Andrew Nikiforuk is an Albertan journalist and author of several books , including the acclaimed Tar Sands : Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent . Lori Theresa Waller interviewed him late last month on the eve of a talk he gave in Ottawa for the launch of his latest book , The Energy of Slaves : Oil and the New Servitude . What follows is an excerpt of their conversation . Part II of this interview will be published later this week .  Lori Theresa Waller : You write , " When it comes to oil , there are only masters , traders and slaves . " Which category would you put Canada in ?  Andrew Nikiforuk : We 're all three , right now . Canada has almost become a plantation economy where all conversations are about the production and export of oil . If you 're opposed to that agenda , you 're a radical and unpatriotic . That 's the kind of low-level conversation you have oil in the sense that half the country is dependent on foreign oil from the Middle East and the North Sea . We are not an energy independent country at all .  LTW : This concept of a petrostate is one you discuss at length . What are the defining characteristics of a petrostate ?  AN : The person who 's done the most work on this is Terry Lynn Carl , an extraordinary political scientist from Stanford University . Americans pioneered oil , and now we have an American who 's pioneered the study of how oil impacts states and governments . Technically a petrostate is any jurisdiction where approximately 20 per cent of its income is coming from hydrocarbons . Alberta was there a long time ago . The first thing that petrostates do is they dismantle the relationship between representation and taxation . They say , " We 're gon na make you all feel warm and fuzzy about oil production by lowering your taxes . " They do n't add the next part , which is " Oh , and by the way , if to represent you . "  Petrostates first and foremost represent the developers of the oil resources . The next thing that happens is that you have so much easy money flowing into a petrostate that all statecraft disappears . Whether you 're looking at Russia or Saudi Arabia or Iran or Nigeria , or Alberta , or Louisiana , Alaska , and Texas , you 're struck by the lack of innovation , the lack of smart public policy . Any and every problem is resolved by pouring petro-dollars on it .  Then the third thing is secrecy . Petrostates are not very transparent because there are so many issues about the money -- who 's getting the money , who 's watching the money , and is any of the money being saved ? That information is very hard to come by . In Alberta , there is a whole fog that surrounds any royalty issues . In fact the government actively discourages any discussion of royalties or corporate taxes .  The fourth characteristic would simply be hubris . When they 're sitting on top of all become wiser and nobler than the rest of mankind . Venezuela was going to have a grand experiment , Mexico was going to have its miracle , and Iran was going to create a new civilization . Alberta had the " new advantage , " and Canada is now going to be the " new energy superpower . " Oil and bullshit go together .  LTW : Do you see a danger of Canada overall becoming a petrostate ?  AN : Absolutely . The governing party , its base largely comes from Alberta , and its financial backers are largely coming from the oil industry . Canada seems today to be only about one thing , and that is the production and export of oil -- at any cost .  LTW : What are the essential changes that you 'd like to see in the way Alberta and the federal government are managing the tar sands boom ?  AN : Since 2008 when I wrote Tar Sands , I 've advocated a set of principles that former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed outlined in 2006 , when he we need to behave like owners " -- we 're not . The second was " we need to collect our fair share . " In other words , control the pace and scale of development by imposing fair royalties and corporate taxes . Right now we 're giving away the resource ; we have among the lowest royalties and taxes in the world .  His next principle was " we should be saving for a rainy day . " He was actually dealing with this whole issue of representation and taxation . He was saying the majority of this money should be saved for future generations ; our government should be running on taxes , and not on these artificial oil revenue streams . Then the next one was " one project at a time , or go slow . "  His other principle was " add value . " We should n't be exporting raw bitumen , any more than we should have been exporting raw logs and raw furs . We should add some value to this resource , because that 's where the real economic and upgrading of bitumen . Instead of peddling bitumen , we should be selling diesel , gasoline and petrochemicals .  His last point was that we should clean up the mess . You ca n't develop a resource like this without adequate scientific monitoring , environmental regulation and enforcement . This is a program that has been entirely ignored in this country . It 's what we need to do .  LTW : At the federal level , a lot of the current policy approach was already in place when Chr ? tien and Martin were in power . Do you think a Liberal government in Ottawa would make much of a difference in terms of tar sands policy ?  AN : No . The danger is that here 's this great pile of cash . Every political party 's going to look at this pile of cash and say , " Here 's an opportunity for us to push our political agenda . " Stephen Harper is using bitumen revenue the same way Margaret Thatcher used North Sea oil revenue to push her political revolution .  : the Green Party and the New Democrats . It would take a courageous political party to say , " We 're not going to run on this revenue , we 're saving it for future generations .
