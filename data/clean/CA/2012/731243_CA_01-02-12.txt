Local African-Canadian achievement now officially has a higher profile , thanks to City Hall 's first ever flag-raising to mark the start of Black History Month .  Several dozen people gathered at City Hall Square on Wednesday to raise a Windsor-designed flag and to talk of Windsor 's connection to African-Canadian history . And to sing .  " A lot of people do n't know that there were actually two emancipation proclamations , " said Marc Taylor , president of the Windsor &amp; District Black Coalition . " They know about the American one but they have no clue about the Canadian one . And the Canadian one was 30 years ahead of the Americans . "  The government of Upper Canada freed slaves in Canada on Aug. 1 , 1834 , which encouraged thousands to escape slavery in the United States and head to freedom in Canada . By contrast , Abraham Lincoln made his emancipation proclamation Jan. 1 , 1863 .  " It 's not a black thing , " Taylor said after the flag-raising ceremony . " Without the Quakers us how to survive . Without the proclamation that was passed by the British parliament , there would be no place for those slaves fleeing from the south to run to , this beautiful promised land called Canada . "  Local African-Canadian leaders expressed pride in their past and sang a capella versions of O Canada , Lift Every Voice and Sing ( also known as the Black National Anthem ) , and Amazing Grace .  " We are somebody , " councillor Ron Jones said several times at the lectern , channelling the speeches of Martin Luther King to encouragements such as ' All right ' and ' Say it ' from the crowd . " We need a Black History Month in order to help us arrive at an understanding of ourselves as Canadians . "  When I Hear Music I See Colour , an art exhibition at Mackenzie Hall , runs from Feb. 10 to 21 .  Comments  We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts .
