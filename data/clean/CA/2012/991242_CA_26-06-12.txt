homeowners who drain their backyard pools onto neighbouring properties will soon be in hot water .  council amended a bylaw tuesday requiring drainage from swimming pools be confined to the property of the owner of the pool .  the amendment comes after a citizen recently complained about what he considered to be an invasion of his property by his neighbour 's efforts to drain his swimming pool .  leonard mather , who lives on kalar rd. , said without such an amendment , people in his predicament would have to take civil action against an " inconsiderate neighbour " to resolve the problem .  " this can only lead to a financial burden for the innocent property owner and there is no telling how long and what the costs would be as it gets due process through the courts of law , " he said in a may letter to city hall .  " perhaps it would in the interest of all property owners to be aware of their responsibilities should they have , or intend to have , a pool installed action , mather asked council to amend its swimming pool bylaw , which would cause his neighbour 's actions to become an offence , and allow staff to remedy the situation .  " this looks like kind of a no-brainer , " said coun. wayne thomson . " why would somebody drain their pool or hot tub or whatever on somebody else 's backyard ? it just does n't make any sense . it should actually go out to the roadway . it 's very easy to do with a hose and a pump . "  staff received a similar complaint from a resident they say does n't appear to be connected with mather . the second complainant also objected to having water inundate his property after his neighbour drained his pool .  the bylaw amendment will also specify the pool owner must follow guidelines for the disposal of pool water as set out by the ministry of the environment .
