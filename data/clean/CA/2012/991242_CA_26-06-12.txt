<p> Homeowners who drain their backyard pools onto neighbouring properties will soon be in hot water . <p> Council amended a bylaw Tuesday requiring drainage from swimming pools be confined to the property of the owner of the pool . <p> The amendment comes after a citizen recently complained about what he considered to be an invasion of his property by his neighbour 's efforts to drain his swimming pool . <p> Leonard Mather , who lives on Kalar Rd. , said without such an amendment , people in his predicament would have to take civil action against an " inconsiderate neighbour " to resolve the problem . <p> " This can only lead to a financial burden for the innocent property owner and there is no telling how long and what the costs would be as it gets due process through the courts of law , " he said in a May letter to city hall . <p> " Perhaps it would in the interest of all property owners to be aware of their responsibilities should they have , or intend to have , a pool installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , Mather asked council to amend its swimming pool bylaw , which would cause his neighbour 's actions to become an offence , and allow staff to remedy the situation . <p> " This looks like kind of a no-brainer , " said Coun. Wayne Thomson . " Why would somebody drain their pool or hot tub or whatever on somebody else 's backyard ? It just does n't make any sense . It should actually go out to the roadway . It 's very easy to do with a hose and a pump . " <p> Staff received a similar complaint from a resident they say does n't appear to be connected with Mather . The second complainant also objected to having water inundate his property after his neighbour drained his pool . <p> The bylaw amendment will also specify the pool owner must follow guidelines for the disposal of pool water as set out by the Ministry of the Environment .
