canada approves historic life-saving stem-cell drug for children  canada has become the first country to greenlight the world 's first approved drug that has stem cells as its active ingredient , offering hope to children suffering from an extremely painful disease that kills up to 80 percent of children affected .  " i am very proud of the leadership role canada has taken in advancing stem cell therapy and particularly gratified that this historic decision benefits children who would otherwise have little hope , " said andrew daly , m.d. , clinical associate professor , department of medicine and oncology at the university of calgary , canada , according to a press release .  as the national institutes of health explains , the immune system , as the body 's tool to fight infection and disease , works by seeing harmful cells as " foreign " and attacking them .  when children receive a donor 's stem cells ( the " graft " ) , their job is to recreate the donor 's immune system in the child 's body ( the " , graft versus host disease ( gvhd ) , the leading cause of transplant related deaths , is the term used when immune cells contained within transplanted bone marrow see the recipient 's organs as foreign and attack them , causing potentially severe damage to the skin , liver and digestive tract .  ? stomach cramps ( especially before and during bowel movements and after eating )  ? persistent nausea  how is gvhd treated ?  doctors try using steroids to stop the attack , but they only have a success rate of 30-50 percent , which is why many children can die within just weeks of diagnosis , the press release states .  in canada , prochymal is now authorized for the management of acute gvhd in children who fail to respond to steroids .  prochymal , developed by osiris therapeutics , is an intravenous formulation of mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) , which are derived from the bone marrow of healthy adult donors between the ages of 18 and 30 years .  the mscs are selected from the bone marrow and grown can be produced from a single donor .  because these are adult stem cells , they do not raise the ethical concerns of embryonic stem cells , whose creation usually involves the destruction of human embryos , reuters adds .  as the new york times notes , stem cells are already used in medicine . bone marrow or stem cell transplants are used to treat various cancers and genetic diseases . but those transplants are medical procedures , not products sold by a drug company .  " as a result of health canada 's comprehensive review , physicians now have an off-the-shelf stem cell therapy in their arsenal to fight gvhd . much like the introduction of antibiotics in the late 1920 's , with stem cells we have now officially taken the first step into this new paradigm of medicine , " daly said , principal investigator in the clinical program for prochymal .  " today is not only a great day for osiris , but for everyone involved in the responsible development of stem cell therapies , " said c. randal mills , ph.d. , importantly , today is a great day for children and their families who bravely face this horrific disease . while today marks the first approval of a stem cell drug , now that the door has been opened , it will surely not be the last . "  mills said thursday that the food and drug administration indicated that it would require more data before approval , prompting osiris to seek approval in canada first , according to the times . he said the company would apply to the f.d.a. later this year .
