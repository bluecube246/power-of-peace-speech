<p> With just weeks to go before the April seal hunt starts off the Newfoundland and Labrador coast , the international market for pelts has all but disappeared , says the Canadian Sealers Association . <p> " In previous years 95 per cent of our products went into Russia and on Jan. 1 the Russian Federation announced a ban on all seal products . . . and there is not alternative place to sell it right now , " Frank Pinhorn , executive director of the association , told the Toronto Star Friday . <p> Even last year , when Russia was still in the game , only a few thousand seals were killed because the price for pelts was only $20 compared to a high of $115 in 2006 . <p> " The laws of economics wo n't allow you do it , " Pinhorn said given the cost of fuel and ammunition . <p> Pinhorn said the slow death of the sealing industry will set off a domino effect -- more seals and less fish . Together , he said , this spells the end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of ( harp seals ) is getting larger every year , " he said noting that the ice conditions this year are " near perfect " for the females to give birth to an expected 1.6 million pups . <p> The estimated seal harp seal population has doubled since 2005 from 5.6 million to more than 9 million , Pinhorn said , adding that each one of them eat 1.4 tonnes of fish each year . <p> " The question is this the end of harvesting seals ? Well , if it is it is also the end of rural Newfoundland and Labrador as we know it . What happens if the herd goes to 12 million or even 15 million ? " <p> Pinhorn said not only are the seals gobbling up the fish stock , there has also been a 35 per cent decrease in the crab quota " because seal consume a tremendous amount of female crabs . " <p> Pinhorn said not only will there not be seal pelts , there wo n't be seal oil for Omega 3 capsules , which are a popular supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know if any seals are being bought this year , " he said . <p> Newfoundland Fisheries Minister Darin King said in January the government was considering buying pelts for a stockpile that would be sold off if and when markets improve .
