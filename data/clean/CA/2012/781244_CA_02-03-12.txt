<h> Looking back on a myriad of Martlets ... <p> They are ubiquitous to the point that , ironically , many of us do n't even notice them any more . Martlets , those footless red birds of mythological fame that have been one of the McGill 's most recognizable symbols for more than 160 years . <p> Martlets first flew onto campus in 1850 , appearing on diplomas and again the following year on the University 's annual calendar . Over the ensuing decades , martlets of all shapes and sizes have appeared on official University items , such as flags , documents and McGill 's coat of arms , to more whimsical items like playbills , sports uniforms and winter carnival floats . <p> Brochure , Winter Carnival , 1952 . <p> In 1922 , Principal Sir Arthur Currie asked architecture professor Percy Nobbs to design a coat of arms , the patent for which was granted that year by the Garter-King-at-Arms in London , England . Different versions of the coat-of-arms were in use until 1975 , when McGill 's Board of Governors settled upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief Herald of Canada in 1992 . <p> " In our holdings we have lots of martlets that are more serious in nature that link back to the heraldry and James McGill . But we also see martlets being depicted with lots of humour and creativity especially when it comes to student activities , " says Theresa Rowat , Director McGill University Archives . " Seeing the two side by side is really fun .

One is located on the first floor of the James Building and the other can be found in the passageway connecting Redpath Library to McLennan Library . <p> See pages 6-7 in the print edition of the McGill Reporter for more samples of the material from the displays . <p> Currently you have JavaScript disabled .
