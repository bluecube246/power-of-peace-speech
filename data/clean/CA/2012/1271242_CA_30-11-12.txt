More review needed on massage parlours : committee  Winnipeg plans to do a more in-depth review of massage parlours amid concerns they should be labelled as body-rub or sex-trade establishments .  Council 's downtown development committee asked the city administration Thursday to conduct further consultations in light of concerns of the Massage Therapy Association of Manitoba that massage parlours sell sex , not massage .  Last week , the city released an administrative report that recommended " holistic medical establishments " would not have to obtain a city licence as a massage parlour as long as owners can demonstrate their membership with a professional body that provides appropriate oversight . The term " holistic medical establishment " was a new way to approve businesses who do n't want to be tagged with the sex-trade connotations of the " massage parlour . "  Winnipeg decided to review its regulation process last year after the owner of Bliss Body Works , a downtown wellness centre , said he had no other choice but to label his business a massage parlour under the current licensing system told members of the downtown development committee he finds the term " holistic medical establishment " problematic , and that the Winnipeg Police Service should be involved in discussions surrounding massage parlours . He said the provincial association receives several complaints regarding massage parlours every year , including a recent complaint from a woman who was propositioned for sex when she visited a downtown parlour in September .  " While the city licenses massage parlours , it has a great deal of difficulty in policing them , " Fraser said . " We would call them sex-trade parlours . "  Massage parlours are only permitted inside Winnipeg 's downtown and employ massagists , who are different than registered massage therapists , as they have not graduated from a recognized school of massage therapy or equivalent educational program .  The City of Winnipeg regulates massage parlours by requiring them to get a licence that stipulates no one under 18 is allowed on the premises , and the parlour may not state , imply or suggest the service provided includes any form of sexual or nude entertainment .  In suspended Winnipeg doctor Randy Raymond for trading OxyContin for sex with two women who worked at a massage parlour .  **28;226;TOOLONG  Other downtown developments :  Illegal parking lot : The owners of the Boyd Building have agreed to get rid of a parking lot on a vacant plot of land on Portage Avenue .

City officials said failure to remove the vehicles would result in legal action . The building 's owners appealed the order initially . On Thursday , city officials said the owners have withdrawn their appeal and agreed to get rid of the parking lot .  St. Charles Hotel : Council 's downtown development committee laid over an appeal on the St. Charles Hotel until January .
