" at the ( 2011 guadalajara ) pan american games village we were almost the only girls not wearing makeup . "  far more of a schlep than the doll she portrays in competition , marcotte puts up with the 90-minute , makeovers for the sake of their synchronizing effect .  " the goal is ( for the team ) really to look the same from far , " she says .  " the same eyes , putting the hair at the same height , almost at the same colour . "  marcotte will perform at the london games in both the team ( eight women ) and duet competitions for canada .  and the key difference between the two disciplines , she says , really comes down to the visual resolutions they demand of spectators .  in camera terms , the team competitions are viewed in wide angle while the duets are pictured with a zoomed in focus .  so while the duet routines are less grand than the team versions , they must be far more harmonized . tiny stuff you do n't see because it 's kind of a big picture , " says marcotte , 23 .  " and in the duet , every finger , every smile needs to look the same . we almost have to breathe at the same time when we go under . you see everything . "  with more and faster movements required on top of the greater synchronization , the duet is the harder of the two disciplines , marcotte says .  " the team is also very hard . you ask the girls in the team they 'll say for sure we 're dying at the end , " she says .  " but dying for dying , the duet is harder . "  marcotte -- " a really energetic kid " -- grew up in a sports mad household and was involved in one kind of lesson or other virtually every weeknight .  almost from the time she was out of diapers , however , it was already becoming clear that the pool would be her place to shine .  " four years old but i was already too good for my age , " marcotte says .  " so they offered my parents to put me either in speed swimming , synchronized swimming or diving . "  maybe because she was developing her lifelong passion for music , marcotte gravitated to the synchro option , which best combined her two favourite things .  she also enjoyed the team dynamics that synchronized swimming imposes on participants , forging in its countless hours of persnickety training a true swimming sisterhood .  " it 's a big family , yes , we 're like sisters , " marcotte says .  and like sisters , the canadian team finds strength and comfort in the individual attributes each member brings to the squad .  " we need to find the strengths and the weaknesses of everyone and we really build on that , " she says .  " i 'm one of the ones who talks a lot and there a few that talk a little bit less so we need that balance to make a good team . of the things marcotte does is in that role share her 2008 beijing olympics experience with her teammates , all but two of whom will be participating in their first games .  " we 're making sure going toward london 2012 that things are going well and everything is under control , " marcotte says .  " in an individual sport , when it 's your first time you do n't have someone helping you getting to it , telling you how you 're going to feel . "
