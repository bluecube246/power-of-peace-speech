<p> " At the ( 2011 Guadalajara ) Pan American Games village we were almost the only girls not wearing makeup . " <p> Far more of a schlep than the doll she portrays in competition , Marcotte puts up with the 90-minute , makeovers for the sake of their synchronizing effect . <p> " The goal is ( for the team ) really to look the same from far , " she says . <p> " The same eyes , putting the hair at the same height , almost at the same colour . " <p> Marcotte will perform at the London Games in both the team ( eight women ) and duet competitions for Canada . <p> And the key difference between the two disciplines , she says , really comes down to the visual resolutions they demand of spectators . <p> In camera terms , the team competitions are viewed in wide angle while the duets are pictured with a zoomed in focus . <p> So while the duet routines are less grand than the team versions , they must be far more harmonized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny stuff you do n't see because it 's kind of a big picture , " says Marcotte , 23 . <p> " And in the duet , every finger , every smile needs to look the same . We almost have to breathe at the same time when we go under . You see everything . " <p> With more and faster movements required on top of the greater synchronization , the duet is the harder of the two disciplines , Marcotte says . <p> " The team is also very hard . You ask the girls in the team they 'll say for sure we 're dying at the end , " she says . <p> " But dying for dying , the duet is harder . " <p> Marcotte -- " a really energetic kid " -- grew up in a sports mad household and was involved in one kind of lesson or other virtually every weeknight . <p> Almost from the time she was out of diapers , however , it was already becoming clear that the pool would be her place to shine . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years old but I was already too good for my age , " Marcotte says . <p> " So they offered my parents to put me either in speed swimming , synchronized swimming or diving . " <p> Maybe because she was developing her lifelong passion for music , Marcotte gravitated to the synchro option , which best combined her two favourite things . <p> She also enjoyed the team dynamics that synchronized swimming imposes on participants , forging in its countless hours of persnickety training a true swimming sisterhood . <p> " It 's a big family , yes , we 're like sisters , " Marcotte says . <p> And like sisters , the Canadian team finds strength and comfort in the individual attributes each member brings to the squad . <p> " We need to find the strengths and the weaknesses of everyone and we really build on that , " she says . <p> " I 'm one of the ones who talks a lot and there a few that talk a little bit less so we need that balance to make a good team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things Marcotte does is in that role share her 2008 Beijing Olympics experience with her teammates , all but two of whom will be participating in their first Games . <p> " We 're making sure going toward London 2012 that things are going well and everything is under control , " Marcotte says . <p> " In an individual sport , when it 's your first time you do n't have someone helping you getting to it , telling you how you 're going to feel .
