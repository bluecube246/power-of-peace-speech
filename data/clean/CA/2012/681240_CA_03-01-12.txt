Mobile Leaderboard  Regent College set to decrease tuition in May 2012  At a time when tuition increases have become the norm , Regent College at UBC is planning to go the other way .  The Regent College cabinet lowered tuition fees by 8.6 per cent through general consensus on October 18 , with the new rates coming into effect May 1 , 2012 .  " The decision to decrease tuition rates was not taken lightly , " said the Regent College director of marketing and communications , Sarah Clayton . " We are acutely aware of the financial burden today 's student is under ... We know that increasing tuition is not sustainable . "  Regent College is an international graduate school of Christian studies located on UBC campus . It is formally affiliated with UBC and all Regent students are members of the AMS .  According to Hannah Dutko , VP External of the Regent College Student Association , the tuition decrease is meant to increase enrolment .  " Essentially , it was just the motivation to decrease the to see people in those seats where there 's good professors and classes . We know that people want to come , so what 's holding them back is money , " she said .  The college also changed its tuition structure to reduce the costs for students who only study part-time .  Previously , students taking less than 9 credits paid $495 per credit , students taking less than 12 credits paid $480 per credit , while full-time students paid $445 per credit hour . Now all students pay a flat rate of $440 per credit .  " It helps people decide whether to take more classes based on the reality of their life , not just whether it will be cheaper if they take this many more classes , " said Dutko .  But students were n't expecting any changes regarding their fees .  " The students were all surprised by it . Even though we all wanted lower tuition , it was n't like we thought it was possible , " said Dutko .  " I was sitting next to the student . He did n't know anything about it . "  American students are expected to benefit most from the tuition savings . Students from the US make up almost one-third of the Regent College student body . Dutko said that as the US dollar has decreased in value , US enrolment has decreased at the same rate .  First-year Master of Divinity student Matt Sidell looks forward to the change and sees the college benefiting in the long run . " If you lower the cost of anything , it actually makes people more excited about it and more likely to promote it ... I think it 's a big deal . "
