<h> Brindi the dog turned over to HRM <p> Francesca Rogier with Brindi in front of Rogier 's home in July 2010 . A judge turned ownership of the dog over to the Halifax Regional Municipality and fined Rogier , Brindi 's former owner , $600 . ( TIM KROCHAK / Staff / File ) <p> UPDATED 6:11 p.m . Tuesday <p> The courtroom saga of Brindi the dog may soon be over . <p> A provincial court judge Tuesday fined owner Francesca Rogier $600 and ordered ownership of the dog transferred to the Halifax Regional Municipality in the latest chapter of a protracted battle over the dog 's fate . <p> However , Judge Flora Buchan stopped short of ordering the dog destroyed . <p> Buchan said Brindi should be treated like any other dog by the municipality and should be trained and adopted out if possible . <p> However , the possibility exists that the animal could be euthanized , but that will only happen if an assessment shows her behaviour ca n't be changed and she is n't adopted . <p> Brindi was seized from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rogier was found guilty earlier this spring of allowing a dog to run at large , failing to comply with an order to muzzle Brindi and owning a dog that attacks an animal . <p> It was the second time nine-year-old Brindi had been seized by animal control . She was previously picked up in 2008 after attacking another dog and was ordered euthanized . <p> However , Rogier successfully appealed and the dog was ordered to be returned to her with conditions that included keeping the dog muzzled in public , building a fence in her backyard and having the dog trained . <p> The second incident happened only two months after Rogier got the dog back . <p> While there was no evidence Brindi is beyond redemption , " sadly " that is not the case with her owner , Buchan said . <p> " I would describe Ms. Rogier as an irresponsible pet owner who has known since she ( adopted ) Brindi that she has control issues , " the judge said , while also calling her " unrepentant . " <p> In ordering Brindi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog " can not safely be returned to Ms. Rogier . " <p> Rogier did not appear in court . Instead , she called dog trainer Susan Jordan shortly before her sentencing was due to start and asked her to appear on her behalf . <p> Jordan , who has worked with Brindi and Rogier , said she thinks Rogier did n't show because she expected the emotions of the day to be too much for her . <p> " I think ... it was going to take more of a toll than she was prepared ( to handle ) , " Jordan said . " To come out after that and try to be coherent and deal with the repercussions ... would be a little more than she could handle . " <p> She said she was pleased the court did n't opt to immediately euthanize Brindi . <p> " I 've trained and worked with the dog , " Jordan said . " This dog certainly has behavioural concerns . ( It ) needs modification training , but the dog is trainable . " <p> She said she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jordan said she last assessed Brindi two weeks ago and in all aspects , except territorial concerns , " this is a highly adoptable dog . " <p> An effort to contact Rogier through Jordan was unsuccessful . <p> While the the city sought an order to have Brindi destroyed , Katherine Salsman , the municipality 's lawyer , said the judge 's decision " is the best of both worlds . " <p> " It allows us to evaluate and ensure ( if adoption ) is the right decision to be made , ... but it still gives us the option to put the dog down if public safety reasons do require it . " <p> The order does n't take effect until Aug. 21 to allow time for an appeal .
