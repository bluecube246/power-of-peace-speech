more than $96,000 in rent owed by hakour enterprises ltd .  the store , operated by hakour enterprises ltd , finally closed its doors late last week with no explanation to its customers or the community other than a notice from the sheriff 's office that now hangs on the door .  that piece of paper -- a notice of distress -- reads that the grocery store and assets contained were seized on may 10 by the sheriff on behalf of c.a. realty ltd. for rent owing of $96,288.90 from nov. 9 , 2010 , to may 2 , 2012 .  " unless the said rent , with charges for distraining the same is paid in four days from the date hereof , the goods and chattels will be appraised and sold according to law , " the notice goes on to say .  store manager wally haddad did not answer calls made to his cellphone or reply to an email sent to summerside valu foods .  a notice dated may 11 from canada post , which operated an outlet at valu store . it reads that postal services are no longer available at the location , noting that full postal services and items too large for customers ' community mailbox or requiring personal verification or signature are available at canada post 's granville street location .  " canada post will be working closely with your community representatives to reach a mutually agreeable solution that meets the needs of your community , " it says . " we apologize for any inconvenience that this unexpected closure has caused . "  " they just showed up and closed them down , " said burton about the closure of valu foods . " it decreased traffic flow , which is not necessarily a good thing . it creates some sort of a controversy that people assume if they are closing we are also closing . "  it was business as usual on friday at the pharmacy as fresh fruit , meat , eggs and cheese sat to rot on the nearby shelves of the nearby valu foods . food aisles surrounding the pharmacy are cordoned off , each blocked by empty metal the sheriff .  " it 's somewhat of a seamless sort of business . appearance is everything but they are really totally two separate businesses , " added burton . " it 's business as usual . "  customers can clearly see laundry detergent , canned beans , dried pasta , cheese , milk , bread and yogurt on the closed grocery store 's shelves as they wait to fill their prescriptions .  " we were in the midst of arranging to move anyway , so we 're moving into a larger site next to dr. ( harold ) molyneaux in a couple of weeks , " said burton . " that was already pre-arranged . we were already moving and expanding because we 're outgrowing our space . this kind of put a fly in the ointment for a couple of weeks and a scramble of what to do at the last minute . it 's only for a couple of weeks . less traffic into the downtown is an issue for everybody . "  the medicine shoppe pharmacy will be in its newly renovated site what makes this your concer and are you david implying that you are a creditor ? show proof there 's citizens owed money . like she said , " who cares why the previous business closed or the square footage or worth of the home , unless of course you 're considering buying this real estate . if your concerned of what your talking about , it can be found on the internet in government of pei records . search for it . " you can access a internet connected computer go use it .  @shellie .... ummmmm who care about the previous owner ... well unless you are not one of the creditors he left with unpaid bills then i guess you would n't care at all . unlike you most islanders do care about island companies getting stiffed by people who operate a business and run away all the while they are living in nice big fancy house paid for by unpaid bills to island companies . shellie ... that is who would care ! ! !  this is a difficult time for valufoods employees &amp; owner what a shame the fresh fruit , meat , eggs and cheese had to be left to rot in valu foods and did n't go to employees ... and to david ... fyi - google the definition for gossiip &amp; busy bodies . then , post the definitions here it will help educate islanders who read it . who cares why the previous business closed or the square footage or worth of the home , unless of course you 're considering buying this real estate . if your concerned of what your talking about , it can be found on the internet in government of pei records . search for it .  is n't this the second time that valu foods was closed by the sheriff ? was n't this place closed a few years ago or the owner just walked away and left all the creditors unpaid and then opened another meat shop in summerside while he lived in nice big house .
