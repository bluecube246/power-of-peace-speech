<h> Are friends with benefits impossible to maintain ? <p> I 'm a 26-year-old lesbian 18 months out of an eight-year relationship . She was my first girlfriend . I do not want to be in another monogamous relationship . I want to have a couple of sex buddies or , preferably , a couple of friends with benefits . In the last 18 months , I have had three FWB " arrangements " with different girls . The problem is , about two or three months in , each girl developed serious like/love feelings and began talking about a future together and how they want to be with me exclusively . Each time , I had to reiterate my feelings about not getting into a relationship and wound up feeling like an asshole . I care about these women and do n't want to hurt their feelings , but I told them the situation from the start . Am I a bad person ? Or are FWB impossible ? <p> &gt; Fears Wilting Boundaries <p> Friends-with-benefits arrangements may not be committed relationships , but they are relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want to sit down for this -- people have been known to develop like/love feelings for folks they 're fucking on a regular basis . So if " getting into a relationship " is something you want to avoid , and you do n't want anyone developing feelings , you should have one-night stands and/or NSA sex instead . ( Those are also relationships , in my opinion , but they 're extremely short-term ones , and people rarely develop serious like/love feelings in a single sex session . ) On to your questions : you are not a bad person . FWB are not impossible -- there are a lot of successful FWB arrangements -- and a desire for exclusivity or a future together is not proof someone entered into an FWB arrangement under false pretences . And reiterating your disinterest in a committed relationship is n't assholery . <p> The sitch : tend bar with a hot girl who has a boyfriend . Hit on her anyway because I 'm that guy . She says I can fuck her but only if her boyfriend gets to watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with that scene . I was down for some traditional cheating , not this kinky shit . But I 'd still like to fuck this girl . Any advice for me ? <p> &gt; Blue-Balled Baller <p> Nope . <p> I 'm a 28-year-old straight female . I 've only ever been able to orgasm if I self-induce while alone or if I 'm on top during sex with a guy and my clit is being rubbed on the guy 's abdomen . ( This works best with bigger guys . ) When there is no abdomen rubbing my clit , I fake it . I can squeeze so it feels as if I 'm coming , but I 'm not . Do you have any suggestions ? <p> &gt; Wants Real Orgasms <p> You 're having real orgasms , WRO . When your clit is fully engaged -- using your hands or toys when alone , rubbing against the abdomen of a big guy during intercourse -- you get off . Some women 's clits are fully engaged during intercourse without any extra effort ( they can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minority . If climaxing during intercourse is important to you , WRO , you 'll have to sleep with big guys exclusively , rub your own clit during sex , or instruct skinny dudes to rub your clit for you . <p> I am in a heterosexual relationship . My boyfriend and I have been together for two years . We were long-distance for the first year and a half . When we were long-distance , he complained that it was hard to have a relationship over the phone . Now that we are in the same city , he says he feels like our relationship has gone " stale " and he feels " trapped " . I 'm sick of his complaining . Does he want to be with me or not ? What is he really trying to say ? <p> &gt; Confusing Lad Is Nagging Girl <p> " I 'm intolerable and you should break up with me . " <p> My question concerns my fianc ? . He is 35 years old . Between the ages of 20 and 30 , he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while in prison , he had sex with a trans woman . I know he loves having sex with cis women , but I found out that he watches a porn genre that features trans women who have penises . He says he is just looking , but I know he masturbates to this porn genre . To be fair , he watches tons of porn featuring cis women . A lot . He loves watching cis women and having sex with cis women . My worry is that he wants to have sex with trans women . Is this a legitimate worry ? He does n't watch gay porn . I just want to make sure of everything if we are going to be married . <p> &gt; Fianc ? Lusts After Trans Women Hottie <p> You would be foolish to waste your time wondering whether your fianc ? wants to have sex with trans women , FLATWH , as it 's clear that your fianc ? wants to have sex with trans women . The question you should concern yourself with is this : can your fianc ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably ) about to make to you , or is he going to cheat on you with other trans and/or cis women ? If you trust that he 'll honour the commitment he makes to you , then his taste in porn and his fantasies about other partners -- trans or not -- are irrelevant . <p> I 'm a married straight man . My wife and I have been married for five years . I thought my wife was GGG and open to new things , so six months ago I brought up my desire to wear lingerie -- she did not react well . We struggled a bit but gradually got back to normal , with me just not mentioning it again . My birthday is in May , so I proposed a weekend of indulgence of my fetish as a birthday present . I thought that would be easy enough to accommodate . I was wrong and got totally and uncomfortably denied . I 'm at a loss for what to do . I do n't want to destroy a marriage over a small sexual interest , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . Any advice on getting her to come around ? <p> &gt; Partner Against Nighties That Intrigue Eager Spouse <p> Someone can be " open to new things " without being " open to everything " . So your wife might be up for exploring other sexual kinks , positions , and circumstances -- hubby-in-lingerie is n't the only form of non-vanilla sex out there -- but seeing you in panties could be a " libido killer " , a term coined by Emily " Dear Prudence " Yoffe . If that 's the case , PANTIES , she may never come around . But if it 's not a libido killer , if it 's just something she has n't had time to wrap her head around , your best course of action is to drop the subject for now . Let the wife see that your interest is n't all-consuming and you still enjoy vanilla sex in gender-conforming underpants , and indulging this particular kink may come to seem less threatening .
