Last week , Facebook Inc. made a very big decision . CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's decision to acquire WhatsApp , a mobile instant messaging app , for $19-billion ( U.S. ) has huge numbers of industry observers questioning his level of sanity and intelligence . But depending on what they do with the acquisition , it could prove to be a brilliant deal that completely redefines mobile communication and generates huge profits for Facebook .  To understand why so many people are shocked , one needs only to look at Facebook 's previous major acquisition . They paid $1-billion to acquire photo sharing app Instagram . Looking only at price and not digging any deeper , the $19-billion price tag for WhatsApp seems crazy . It was also popular opinion that Instagram was also too expensive . It 's only natural for people to look at the WhatsApp deal and conclude that Mr. Zuckerberg has lost his mind if he 's paying nearly 20 times as much money for a five-year-old mobile instant-messaging company that brings in very little revenue .  I 'll admit the a chance to think about the deal and consider its long-term potential to change Facebook 's future , I realized Mr. Zuckerberg could be making a brilliant move . It 's quite clear to me he 's thinking about the next decade or more , while most short-term-minded investors suffer from tunnel vision locked onto today 's revenue .  In the next decade , I think the majority of the world will stop using SMS , otherwise known as text messages , and shift to data-oriented messaging programs on their smartphone . Facebook 's goal should be , and appears to be , to own this market . There is no global standard today , so Google , Apple , BlackBerry , WhatsApp and others compete with each other just like the classic example of VHS versus Beta in the early VCR market .  WhatsApp is huge . It has 450 million monthly active users , and 70 per cent of these users are active on any given day . They are growing at one million new users per day , so they could reach over a billion people the WhatsApp network carries almost as many messages as the global SMS market .  I also think this goes far beyond instant messaging . I believe the mobile communication industry is set to have one dominant application for text , voice and video . WhatsApp will be bringing voice messaging to its platform later this year . Facebook is n't just betting on texts : I think they 're making a play to dominate all forms of communication on mobile devices . Since WhatsApp is already huge , the network effect is on Facebook 's side .  Can this be monetized ? Clearly . Whether it be collecting better data for targeting ads on Facebook or selling subscriptions to services , the possibilities are endless . When you consider that the global SMS market brings in about $100-billion annually ( according to Facebook ) , it 's pretty clear that there is money to be made here .  Considering the massive size of this industry , winning matters . And up until now Facebook was not winning . Not even close . By the company 's own admission , more as a replacement for e-mail . In other words , people are not in the habit of using Facebook Messenger for real-time conversations . That 's where WhatsApp shines .  Facebook has n't just invested $19-billion to take over a popular instant messaging app . They 've invested in the possibility of dominating mobile communication , using voice , video and text . The upside , should they execute well , is probably larger than most of us can imagine .  This is not a short-term bet , nor is it suitable for those with weak stomachs . Short-term thinking by CEOs and investors is , in my opinion , dangerous . I 'd much rather see investors model the thinking of successful executives who have a proven track record of creating long-term value versus the short-term thinking of most professional investors who underperform the market .  If you own Facebook shares as a long-term investment as I do , both personally and in my Strategy Lab portfolio , I 'd suggest you view this acquisition as a very reasonable risk for Facebook to take .
