<p> It 's a conversation they 've been having a lot lately . Hubbard says that since Quannah started to grow his hair out , people have begun mistaking him for a girl and he recently asked if he could cut it . <p> She asked her son to take some time and think about it before making such a big decision . <p> " A lot of men in my family wear their hair long so I understood that to be a source of our strength as a people . Also the historical context that for a long time that was n't allowed that children upon going to residential school had to have their hair cut . So I wanted my son to have long hair . " <p> But she also worried because he was teased and bullied in the past at a different school in Saskatoon . <p> " I felt really sad for him and for that fear of being laughed at , for being singled out for how he looks and how he chooses to wear his hair . " <p> So Hubbard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her post quickly generated a lively discussion from other First Nation parents who were struggling with similar issues . <p> Azure Johnson is one of them . Her twin sons are six years old and traditional pow wow dancers . <p> She says they sometimes ask to cut their hair but she thinks it 's important for them to wear it long . <p> " It 's a sign of showing others my culture and that I 'm proud of who I am and I want my boys to be proud of who they are . " <p> Johnson says she was n't raised with that culture so it 's especially important for her children . <p> " As they get older , they 'll be able to withstand the stuff they 're going to deal with because they 're going to deal with racism and stereotypes and discrimination and ignorance . If I start teaching them to embrace their culture , maybe it wo n't be so tough for them as it was for me . " <p> Terri Moore wrote : I allowed my oldest son the wear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was natural and was to our tradition , until he ( my son ) started to cry when people would mistake him being a girl . Still I continued and it came to a point where he begged it to be cut . Once cut a happier child . I believe its up to the kid whether he wants his hair cut or left long and we should n't push our traditions on the kids . <p> Hubbard , who is also a filmmaker , says the debate has inspired her and Quannah to make a documentary on the subject and at least for now , Quannah says he will keep his braids . <p> Note : The CBC does not necessarily endorse any of the views posted .
