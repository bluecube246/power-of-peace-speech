Manulife Financial Corp. , Canada 's largest life insurer , agreed to help develop a 27-storey tower in Montreal as the company expands in Quebec with the planned purchase of a unit from Standard Life Plc .  Manulife will occupy more than half the space of the new building , which will be developed with Ivanhoe Cambridge at 900 de Maisonneuve Boulevard West , the Toronto-based insurer said Monday in a statement . Financial terms were n't disclosed .  Construction of the glass tower will begin as soon as the first quarter of 2015 , following approval of the Standard Life transaction by shareholders and regulators , Manulife said . The insurer will lease at least 11 floors of the tower and relocate about 2,000 employees now housed in Manulife and Standard Life offices in downtown Montreal .
