<h> What is this ? <p> REGINA -- Regina city council has approved a plan that aims to improve several elements of public transit downtown . <p> One aim is to reduce traffic on 11th Avenue , one of downtown Regina 's busiest roads . The downtown transportation study recommends as designing a transit hub to be located on Lorne Street , between 11th Ave . and 12th Ave . <h> Related <p> In other cities , similar facilities allow buses to sit in a queue -- rather than stop on a main road -- while also improving the transit rider experience , according to the Regina Downtown Business Improvement District ( RDBID ) . <p> " ( People can ) wait in the warmth and access a restroom , coffee shop or newspaper stand . There might be chairs in there so they can sit down , " said Judith Veresuk , RDBID executive director . Then when their bus comes , they pop out into the bus bay area and get on their bus . " <p> Eastbound bus stops on 11th Ave . will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block between Lorne Street and Cornwall Street . That stop had been the subject of complaints from business owners due to transit users loitering inside the building . <p> At one point , council had considered a transit shuttle service for the downtown area . According to mayor Michael Fougere , that would be cost-prohibitive right now -- but may be implemented in the next few years . <p> " When we have the new stadium built , a shuttle service from downtown would be feasible . That way you could integrate a shuttle service all throughout downtown to the stadium and back , " Fougere said . <p> Fougere adds that initiatives such as bus stop relocation will happen right away .
