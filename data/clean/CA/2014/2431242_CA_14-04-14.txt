what is this ?  regina -- regina city council has approved a plan that aims to improve several elements of public transit downtown .  one aim is to reduce traffic on 11th avenue , one of downtown regina 's busiest roads . the downtown transportation study recommends as designing a transit hub to be located on lorne street , between 11th ave . and 12th ave .  related  in other cities , similar facilities allow buses to sit in a queue -- rather than stop on a main road -- while also improving the transit rider experience , according to the regina downtown business improvement district ( rdbid ) .  " ( people can ) wait in the warmth and access a restroom , coffee shop or newspaper stand . there might be chairs in there so they can sit down , " said judith veresuk , rdbid executive director . then when their bus comes , they pop out into the bus bay area and get on their bus . "  eastbound bus stops on 11th ave . will be the block between lorne street and cornwall street . that stop had been the subject of complaints from business owners due to transit users loitering inside the building .  at one point , council had considered a transit shuttle service for the downtown area . according to mayor michael fougere , that would be cost-prohibitive right now -- but may be implemented in the next few years .  " when we have the new stadium built , a shuttle service from downtown would be feasible . that way you could integrate a shuttle service all throughout downtown to the stadium and back , " fougere said .  fougere adds that initiatives such as bus stop relocation will happen right away .
