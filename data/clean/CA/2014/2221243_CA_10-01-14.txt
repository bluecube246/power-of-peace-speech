The next night , another massive power outage occurred when a breaker at the Holyrood switchyard malfunctioned . <p> The PUB , which regulates electrical distribution in the province , said it will draft the " process and timelines " for its inquiry over the coming days . <p> Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro has come in for hefty criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging equipment was not able to generate enough power to meet consumer demand that was significantly higher than expected .
