this ready-to-drink cocktail -- alcohol included -- boasts all-natural ingredients and no high-fructose corn syrup or msg . how refreshing . packaged in a cute one-litre jug , it follows a couple of other good offerings in the crazy uncle lineup launched by toronto food-products entrepreneurs ( and brothers ) bruno and davide codispoti . not your typical industrial vodka coolers , these are small-batch products with craft-cocktail sensibility . and there 's in fact a chef behind the uber caesar : guy rubino , most notable for the former toronto restaurant rain . thick , pulpy and spicy , the booze-and-clamato beverage is big on hot sauce , horseradish and garlic powder , mixed to impressive effect . it dials in at just 9-per-cent alcohol , so if you like your caesar with more of a kick , pick up a mickey of vodka , too .
