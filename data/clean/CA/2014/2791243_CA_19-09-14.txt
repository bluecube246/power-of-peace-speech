<p> This ready-to-drink cocktail -- alcohol included -- boasts all-natural ingredients and no high-fructose corn syrup or MSG . How refreshing . Packaged in a cute one-litre jug , it follows a couple of other good offerings in the Crazy Uncle lineup launched by Toronto food-products entrepreneurs ( and brothers ) Bruno and Davide Codispoti . Not your typical industrial vodka coolers , these are small-batch products with craft-cocktail sensibility . And there 's in fact a chef behind the Uber Caesar : Guy Rubino , most notable for the former Toronto restaurant Rain . Thick , pulpy and spicy , the booze-and-clamato beverage is big on hot sauce , horseradish and garlic powder , mixed to impressive effect . It dials in at just 9-per-cent alcohol , so if you like your Caesar with more of a kick , pick up a mickey of vodka , too .
