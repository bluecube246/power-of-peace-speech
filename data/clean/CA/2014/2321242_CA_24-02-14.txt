<p> Alberta and Saskatchewan are calling on the federal government to intervene to ease a backlog of grain in the Prairies , by brokering deals to ship more by rail and levying cash fines if railways do n't live up to obligations . <p> The backlog stems from a combination of an unusually ample harvest last year and competing demands for capacity on Canada 's railways , with recent cold weather adding to the shipping pinch . Western Canada farmers netted a bumper crop in 2013 , harvesting nearly 40 per cent more grain than the five-year average , according to Alberta . But farmers have since faced long delays getting their product to port and seen product prices slump in the meantime . <p> Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz responded by saying all options are on the table , but criticized rail companies for insufficiently addressing the delays . <p> Saskatchewan wants Ottawa to " immediately " broker service agreements between grain and rail companies to require certain levels of shipping , while Alberta wants Ottawa to bring in fines against railways who deliver " inadequate service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the backlog , said Bill Boyd , Saskatchewan 's Minister of the Economy . " I think there 's blame to go around here . I do n't think there 's any individual group that is without blame , " Mr. Boyd said in an interview Monday . Without service agreements , " there 's no obligation , there 's no accountability built into the system . " <p> Some critics argue grain shippers are being pinched as energy companies move oil-by-rail , leaving fewer locomotives to haul grain cars . Gary Stanford , president of the Grain Growers of Canada , welcomed the provincial proposal if penalties would lead to faster grain shipment , though he is n't sure how that might work in practice . " They 're private companies . To step in and make legislation , would it really help us in the short term ? " <p> He said the oil shipments , by themselves , have n't had " much of an effect " on the grain backlog . " There 's a lot more product on the railroad overall , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added . <p> Alberta says current penalties for rail companies are vague and often lead to lengthy arbitration . <p> Asked about the two provinces ' proposals , Mr. Ritz responded with a statement saying he wo n't let farmers " be held hostage by this poor service " of rail and grain companies . <p> " The bottom line is that the current level of rail service is unacceptable to farmers , and the railways have not yet put forward a viable plan to address this year 's bumper crop . Our government will not let farmers or our economy be held hostage by this poor service , and we are considering all options to ensure our farmers are able to get their crops to market , " Mr. Ritz said , in a statement released by spokesman Jeffrey English . <p> In an interview with The Canadian Press , however , Mr. Ritz signalled a reluctance to take " prescriptive " action . " At the end of the day , there 's nothing stopping the grain companies and the railways from negotiating with reciprocal penalties as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing that now , " he said . <p> Both CP and CN say they 're making more cars available , but that a cold snap has hampered efforts because frigid weather requires that trains be kept shorter to ensure brakes function properly . <p> CN says it made available 3,530 empty grain cars last week , and hopes to average 4,000 per week " as soon as extreme cold temperatures abate . " By April , the railway hopes to run as many as 5,500 cars per week . " CN is doing its level-best to move this 100-year grain crop to export position and world markets , " spokesman Mark Hallman said . <p> Asked about the call for government-negotiated pacts , he said the company prefers " collaboration " with grain companies . " CN believes increased supply-chain collaboration , involving all stakeholders , not just railways , is the best way to drive a more efficient grain transportation system , " Mr. Hallman said . <p> Canadian Pacific Railway declined to respond to the provinces ' requests , and could n't offer any specific numbers of cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it shipped 17 per cent more grain than the five-year average . " With a record crop size , CP recognizes the urgency currently facing Western Canadian grain farmers , " CP spokesman Ed Greenberg said . <p> CP CEO Hunter Harrison said last week that the railway is moving grain as fast as it can but often faces delays unloading the product . The Saskatchewan government said Monday grain companies " told us they could quickly move to provide service 24 hours a day if the grain reaches them . " <p> Grain prices have slumped 20 to 30 per cent for farmers since the fall , Mr. Boyd said , adding buyers are now looking elsewhere . " We see our premium markets , like Japan , being lost as a result " of the backlog , Mr. Boyd said , adding he hopes Mr. Ritz acts quickly to broker a deal with rail and grain companies . " Frankly , I think he 's frustrated with the whole system , too . This is a way to kick-start negotiations , " Mr. Boyd said .
