<h> Montreal will extend project to recycle polystyrene <p> Fran ? ois Beauchesne of Polyform examines some of the styrofoam collected at the St. Patrick Eco Centre in LaSalle during a press conference in Montreal , on Thursday , November 27 , 2014 . Peter McCabe / Montreal Gazette <h> Most people know it by the brand name Styrofoam , that white foam packaging that comes with most mail-order products , or is used in disposable coffee cups . <p> For the most part , polystyrene ends up in the trash , taking up precious space in landfills , as the product is made up of 98 per cent air , and two per cent plastic . <p> Now the city of Montreal is expanding a program to allow residents to recycle the foam . For at least the next five years , the Ecocentre in LaSalle will be accepting any plastic material denoted with the number 6 on its packaging . That includes the aforementioned packaging and cups , but also yogourt containers , clear plastic boxes used to hold fruits and vegetables , and even razors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's curbside program . <p> R ? al M ? nard , the executive committee member in charge of environmental matters said so far , only the LaSalle Ecocentre has enough space to collect the material , but the Ecocentre now being built in St-Laurent could also collect the material when it opens next year . <p> " We could also look at collecting it curbside , but we have n't gotten there yet , " M ? nard said . <p> Montreal is not alone in offering collection of polystyrene . <p> Elsewhere in Canada , 181 cities and towns offer curbside collection for rigid polystyrene , like yogourt containers , and 45 municipalities will pick up foam packaging . Roughly another 40 offer depot programs like the what is being offered in the LaSalle Ecocentre . <p> The city provided 2.5 tonnes of polystyrene in a year-long pilot project with the Canadian Plastics Industry Association that began last year . <p> " The problem is that everyone here in North America thinks about recycling in terms of cost , " said Fran ? ois Beauchesne , the vice-president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which recycles the materials and produces finished products for use in road construction , and in building materials . <p> He explained that other polystyrene producers recycle their material , but Polyform is the only company partnering with the city for this program . The process does n't save Polyform any money , but the company said it feels a responsibility to reduce its carbon footprint . <p> Polyform has implemented similar programs at the Ecocentre in Granby , where its head office is located , and in Sherbrooke . <p> Beauchesne said his competitors generally recycle their own finished products and do n't go collecting from the public . <p> He said that when his trucks deliver their orders , they make a run to furniture companies , like Sears , and to the Ecocentres to collect used foam in order for it to be recycled . <p> The company collects about seven tonnes of the material per day , so only a tiny fraction of that now comes from Montreal . <h> Comments <p> We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussion , so we ask you to avoid personal attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful .
