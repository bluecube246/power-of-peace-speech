Owned by Richard Lim ( who is also the proprietor of Wildflower and East ) , Lazia has been a downtown staple since it opened in 2002 . Previously , the menu was very large , with some 70 items to choose from . But as of Sept. 8 , the menu has been pared back , and its focus sharpened . The restaurant itself has also undergone a bit of a makeover , with a blue colour palate replacing the red and orange decor .  Lim points out that local producers including Irvings Farm Fresh and Peas on Earth are now supplying the restaurant with various products , including Berkshire Pork and organic kale . Hemp hearts are sourced from Wilmar Farms , and duck eggs from Greens , Eggs and Ham make an appearance in the grilled asparagus salad . Straw Man Farm bison is also featured . Many gluten-free and vegetarian items are available on the new menu . Brunch is served weekends from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m .
