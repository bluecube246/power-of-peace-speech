In defence of women over 30  On the left , what actor Renee Zellweger looked like on the red carpet in Beverly Hills in October 2014 . On the right , what she looked like in September 2011 . ( Frazer Harrison , Mike Coppola/Getty Images )  I bought some pants , and they were n't the black ones . They were the snappy electric blue ones . Because I 've decided that being in my forties does n't mean I have to give up on being noticed .  I mean it : I 've had it up to my crow-footed eyeballs with wearing black 24/7 and living life as the Invisible Woman , just because I was born before the advent of the Internet and remember Anna Paquin as that little girl in The Piano , pre-Sookie Stackhouse .  Yes , I get that we live in a youth-dominated culture . You would have to be blind , deaf and a Kardashian not to know .  I mean , when Taylor Swift can put out an album with her birth year face , you know the young'uns are ruling the roost . Never mind that whole push a few years back that said that 40 is the new 30 . Yeah , right . And cellulite is the new black .  The fact is this whole obsession with youth ; particularly feminine youth , mystifies me .  What is so much better about lacking experience , discretion , and laugh lines ? Why is it that a butt you can bounce a quarter off of and breasts that have n't yet become acquainted with a waistline still trump every other female attribute ?  I assume it 's the same thing that makes ad companies choose prepubescent girls in hyper-sexualized outfits to sell us almost everything , while the only thing women over 40 are peddling are adult diapers and life insurance .  Even if older women miraculously appear on magazine covers , they are : a ) famous and b ) air-brushed to kingdom come , as if wrinkles were an affront to polite society . Craziness .  Why is it that in 2014 , women of still regularly relegated to the background , like so many bruised bananas in the great Fruit Bowl of Life ?  Why can men be seen as compelling and powerful , no matter their age ? Sean Connery is almost 80 , and women still think he 's all that and a bag of chips . Who decided it does n't work that way for women ? Why is it the Law of Toyland that we automatically become less attractive and less noticeable once we hit 30 ?  Are n't Canadian men educated , liberated and aware of the perks of appreciating women who are less ... perky ? After all , these women have careers , homes , vehicles and can tell the difference between a Cabernet and a Shiraz .  Or are older females the societal equivalent of broccoli ? Are we passed over just because Canadian men have been conditioned to want ( youthful ) eye candy instead ? Really ? That feels very high school to me . Junior high school , even . And I do n't think anyone wants to go back there poor face .  A talented actor who won an Oscar for her work , Ms Zellweger is a beautiful and charismatic woman with a goofy grin and the tendency to look as if she 's about to burst out laughing . Which is why I was absolutely horrified when I saw the inimitable Miz Zee online recently , looking like she 'd been dragged backwards through several Botox clinics .  No more squinty eyes , pink cheeks and lopsided grin . She is now a near-perfect , expressionless canvas , who attributes it to " ... living a different , happy , more fulfilling life . " Uh huh . On that basis , the Dalai Lama should look like Brad Pitt .  Call me Mr. Magoo , but Ms Z. 's had plastic surgery , and lots of it . Do n't get me wrong : I believe Renee Zellweger ( anyone , for that matter ) can do whatever the heck she wants to herself -- ' wants ' being the operative term . I simply have a hard time believing that she has erased every .  It seems to me that the logical assumption is that this already-beautiful woman is scared of looking her age . I guess no matter how talented , beautiful and well-known you are , it means nothing if you are n't on the sunny side of 30 .  And that 's what bugs me .  If someone like Renee Zellweger feels insecure enough to endure surgery just to look marginally younger , then what chance does Jo Doe have to feel comfortable in her own ( less-taut ) skin ? If money , talent and fame ca n't buy confidence , I can guarantee you credit card debt , endless housework and the stress of raising children sure wo n't .  Trust me : it 's not that I picked the blue pants because I 'm trying to look younger . It 's just that I do n't want to be handed a bill of goods that tells me that in order to be accepted in society , I have to resign myself to being ignored .
