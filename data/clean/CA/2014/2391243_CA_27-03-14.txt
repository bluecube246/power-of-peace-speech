a video circulating on facebook has become part of an investigation into an alleged assault of a 14-year-old boy earlier this week .  at about 7:40 p.m. on monday the corner brook royal newfoundland constabulary received an anonymous report of an injured male youth near the valley mall .  the boy was taken to western memorial regional hospital were he was treated for non-life threatening injuries and released .  an rnc media report from tuesday said that the investigation into the incident resulted in another 14-year-old boy being arrested and charged with assault causing bodily harm . the alleged assailant was later released into the custody of a parent .  sometime after the incident , a 23-second video of the assault appeared on facebook . a link to the video could still be accessed thursday morning .  it shows a bigger male youth punching a smaller boy in the face . the victim tries to get away , but the alleged assailant pursues him and strikes him several more times before the boy falls to the ground . the beating continues with victim is on the ground  the incident looks like it was filmed in the parking garage at the valley mall . and a female can be heard laughing as the assault takes place .  const . scott mosher , the rnc 's media relations officer , said thursday morning that a copy of the video is now in the hands of investigators .  " when the initial complaint was made , ? i do n't think there was any sign of the video , " said mosher in a phone interview conducted prior to him issuing a media release on the incident .  mosher said police have not yet determined who shot the video or have anything concrete on what may have provoked the alleged assault .  the video has been shared more than 100 times with many people adding their thoughts to the comments section .  some say the victim got what he deserved , while others speak out against the violent act . there are also comments that point to the attack being in retaliation for another action and some , disturbingly , a video like the one in question is quite rare , but is a sign of the times . he said we 're living in a society where people 's private lives are posted everywhere through photos and comments on social media sites like facebook and twitter .  " in terms of the investigation , " mosher said the video " makes it visually a little more serious or obvious of what had transpired . "  he said in a normal investigation officers are dealing with words -- what one side has to say about the other .  " but whenever there 's video evidence , it 's certainly more compelling than the written word . "  mosher said the fact someone would videotape an assault and do nothing to stop it is very concerning .  " we talk about in some of our school programs how people can take responsibility for violence . and one of the things discussed is not being a bystander . it 's being someone who takes action . "  mosher said people who engage in violence do so because type of behaviour we 're trying to eradicate . "  the alleged attacker is scheduled to appear in provincial youth court on may 14 .  comments  comments  your name*email*comment*  recent comments  a concerned parent/grandmother  march 29 , 2014 - 08:17  omg this is absolutely not acceptable ! what were people thinking watching this happen ! you are all cowards ! ! ! ! had you stepped in the bully would know " we 're not gon na take it . " shame shame on you all ... do n't let this ever happen again on your watch ! be proud to be the first one to step forward and your " friends " will follow . pray that the attacked teen is ok ... it could have very well ended differently .  this is utterly disgusting and heart wrenching . why would someone do this , and as for the people that were there that taped it and watched your just at fault . no matter if this young boy did something or not he did not deserve this . this is at saying that its not all the parents fault either . if parents and teens had that open relationship were they could be open and honest with one another this would have never happened . to the teens that were there i hope in the future instead of watching someone get hurt you will be that one person to stand up and help someone out . i feel for that young boy and his family i hope that he is ok . i also feel bad for the bully because i know some where deep inside there might be a good young man with with just bad poor judgment . i hope that you get the help that is needed . i also hope that you grow a set and apologize to him and his family . also the ones watching i hope that your apologize is in the future .  wish they would post the parent 's names . no shame attached to anything any more . no honor in a family name , when i was growing up if your mother did n't yell at ya , your mother . so ya had 10 people trying to smarten you up instead of 2 .  from what i have heard there is much more to this story then just the assault . it is sad from all views . what i ca n't get is how someone can record this and do nothing about it . also the kids involved are the same age .  i watched this video a few days ago and it upset me so much that i cant even begin to express my sadness but anger as well . i do nt understand why the bystanders did nt step in . im really hoping that the bigger kid do get what he deserves because what really is the anti bullying law good for if people like him get away with it ? he couldve done some serious damage or worse ( it has happened ... ) .  " which is exactly the type of behaviour we 're trying to eradicate . " eradicate violence , or giving youngsters attention ! parents , put your smartphones down , and wake up . all day they are 14 . they will learn . end provincial government ( exhibit a ' felix collins " ) is a start to ending bullying , and the general culture of revenge by social media ( exhibit b " gerry rogers " ) . they perpetuate it . end provincial government . end violence . or are bloodsports like politics and retributive shitkickings in our dna ? i only ask that all mhas step down , and frig off , thats all .  its so sad what the youth have come to these days . makes you wonder what the state of the world will be like in 50 - 100 years . this is just a very sad look into the future of more and more serious problems .
