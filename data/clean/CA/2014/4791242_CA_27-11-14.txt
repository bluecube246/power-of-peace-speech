The health authority is apologizing to those affected by the privacy breach after its investigation concluded yesterday , said Dr. Mary Lyn Fyfe , chief medical information officer for Island Health .  " It is extremely disappointing and completely unacceptable that staff members would breach a patient 's right to privacy , and it is a total violation of the confidentiality acknowledgement that must be signed by each of our employees and physician partners , " said Fyfe .  " It also violates the trust people place in us . First and foremost , we sincerely apologize to those directly impacted by this , and residents . "
