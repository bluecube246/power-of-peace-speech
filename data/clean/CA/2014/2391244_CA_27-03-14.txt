so , what happened during the 2014 mayoral election 's first televised debate ?  so , what happened during the 2014 mayoral election 's first televised debate ?  last night 's citynews mayoral debate was the first opportunity for 2014 's mayoral candidates to interact with one another on television . it was , in more ways than one , a mess . the format was a free-for-all , with short opening statements from each of the candidates followed by no-moderation shouting matches on general topics like " transit " and " leadership . " this way of doing things tended to reward loud voices and feigned indignation , which happen to be two of rob ford 's strengths . and so it 's not particularly surprising that most of the post-debate analysis has focused on how unexpectedly well he did , considering , you know , all the stuff . nobody even mentioned crack until more than an hour in .  there were a few opportunities for pre-selected journalists to pose questions to the candidates of their choice , but by and large much is n't entirely citynews 's fault : it 's still relatively early in the campaign and none of the candidates have finalized their platforms yet .  even so , there were some good parts . here are some of them :  most-vicious burns :  " you 've let the citizens of this city down . you 've let the reputation of this city down . maybe you 'd like to address that . ( tory , to ford )  " i do n't really need to take any lessons from you , because we 're not on the golf course right now . " ( chow , to tory )  " how could you get away with all this crazy lying ? because there 's not truth . " ( chow , to ford )  " john , you had your chance at the province and you fell flat on your face . you know it and i know it . " ( ford , referencing tory 's time as leader of the ontario pc party )  most-derisive mentions of david miller : councillors against the irresponsible spending of david miller . in this election , voters will have a choice , and we need to make sure that we do not go back . " ( stintz )  " david soknaki , you were part of team miller , as were you , olivia . and we heard loud and clear in the last election that voters wanted change . they did n't like those ndp spending practices . " ( stintz )  *there 's no obvious basis for the assertion that d-soks was a spendthrift during his time as budget chief . spending hikes during his tenure were in line with what has happened under other budget chiefs since amalgamation .  ways the candidates are just like you and me :  " where i come from , we make 50 cents do a dollars ' worth of work . " ( soknacki )  " my family moved to toronto when i was 13 . my mother could n't find a job as a schoolteacher , so she worked in a hotel and then in a laundry department i know the value of the dollar . " ( chow )  " as a mom with two kids , and ten years on council , i 've learned a lot about our city . " ( stintz )  reasons rob ford does n't deserve to be reelected :  " rob ford wants to waste a billion dollars on his transit plan in scarborough . " ( chow )  " whatever he 's done in the past three years -- and that 's a subject of great debate -- he 's run out of gas . he 's not able to get anything through the city council anymore . " ( tory )  " he is really not a good role model for my grandchildren , or your kids . " ( chow )  face rob ford makes when confronted with the fact that he has n't actually saved the city " a billion dollars " during his mayoralty :  best dressed :  olivia chow , with the cn tower on her shirt .  number of times karen stintz said the word  four .  time before rob ford was forced to explain his behaviour by saying " i 'm not perfect " :  one hour and nine minutes , and only when asked about his crack scandal by a journalist on the debate 's expert panel .
