mark allison , 16 , who lost his right leg to cancer , is seen friday with a prosthetic limb designed for swimming . ( christian laforce/staff )  mark allison is used to stares and sometimes being called " peg leg " or a " cripple . "  the 16-year-old queens county boy is a child amputee . mark was diagnosed with cancer at the age of three and lost his right leg ( below the knee ) to the disease about two months later .  he 's never let insults or the loss of his leg prevent him from leading an active life .  he uses one artificial limb for walking , basketball and long-boarding and a second waterproof one for swimming .  " it 's about what 's left that matters , " he said in an interview friday at the war amps atlantic child amputee seminar in halifax .  " what 's gone is gone . if you get over you being an amputee , you 're going to be the person that you want to be and "  growing up in hunts point , near liverpool , mark would always be the first one out on the playground .  " as a kid i 've always been pushing myself to my limits , " he said .  " i would always be outside when i could be as a kid growing up and i would get some stares because i have to do some things differently like hang upside down on the monkey bars ... i had to do it differently than everybody else but i always got by ... and i just talked myself into doing whatever i thought i could , so whatever was possible , i did . "  mark and siobhan macdonald , a 16-year-old from mabou , are among 50 children from atlantic canada gathered for this weekend 's seminar .  seminar topics include raising a child amputee , healthy living , dealing with teasing and staring and seeing the latest developments in artificial limbs .  siobhan 's amputation is also above her right knee . she sports a multicoloured design on her artificial limb , rather part of her right hand and her left arm and with bones missing in her right leg . her foot was also rotated a bit to the right . her parents chose to amputate her right foot when she was two .  " i remember going to school and i was like , ' why do they have all their limbs ? ' i was n't used to it , " she said .  because she lives in such a small community and everyone knows the story of her early amputation , she has n't really dealt with a lot of questions , she said .  siobhan sails using a paralympic-class boat .  as well , she plays guitar with a specially made sleeve and pick crafted especially for her by a worker at the nova scotia rehabilitation centre .  in the past , she 's done able-bodied sailing .  siobhan has set a goal to compete in the paralympics in tokyo , japan , in 2020 .  " when you face anything you can either have a mindset as in , ' no i ca n't do it ' or just say ' what the heck , let 's try it . ' "  both teens are members of the the war amps child amputee ( champ ) program .  the program offers support services to amputees and their families and provides financial assistance for artificial limbs and recreational devices .
