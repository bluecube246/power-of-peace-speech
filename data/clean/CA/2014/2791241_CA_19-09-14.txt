The inspector , Imre Toth , estimated the repairs would cost them $15,000 to $20,000 . <p> They closed the deal . <p> When the bill came in , it totalled $213,000 . <p> They filed suit against Toth , the sellers and the real estate agents , but settled with the previous owners and dropped their claim against the agents . <p> The purpose of the inspection is to provide a homebuyer with expert advice about any significant deficiencies , the judge wrote . <p> " I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the plaintiffs relied upon the report received by Mr. Toth to decide whether they would purchase the property , " he wrote . <p> " Plainly , if prospective home purchasers did not believe that they could secure meaningful and reliable advice about the home they were considering purchasing , there would be no reason for them to retain an inspector to inspect that home .
