Neil Young's Pono system - hard to say if its time has come

say what you will about neil young : he 's blunt , he 's mercurial , he does n't " realize that there are other people involved in this world , " as graham nash puts it in his recent autobiography .  but there 's one adjective you could n't imagine applying to him , at least not until he made his session at sxsw for his portable , high-fidelity music system , pono : pitchman .  as the toronto star 's ben rayner observed from austin , young is on a quest to " bring vinyl-quality sound to a generation of music consumers accustomed to listening to thin mp3 files through laptop speakers and earbuds ' that look like lozenges ' . "  for music lovers -- especially music lovers of a certain age -- it 's a tantalizing promise : a chance to hear music like it used to sound , before those kids with their mp3s and iphones and their insistence that music consumption be , above all else , convenient got their hands on it .  but watching the get a sinking feeling , and here 's why .  1 . the product is aimed at out-of-home listening . if we want vinyl-quality sound in our living room , we 'll just play records . a decent turntable is relatively inexpensive , and toronto is blessed with an abundance of used-record shops where you can still ( as we did recently ) stumble upon an original copy of young 's harvest , complete with lyric sheet and grainy cover , for eight bucks . no portable format can beat that .  and we do n't know about you , but our car is n't equipped with the kind of speakers that can distinguish between 44.1 khz/16 bit cd quality and 192/24 ultra-high resolution , especially when we 're sitting amid the roar of rush hour traffic on the gardiner .  2 . the players are n't cheap . once they hit stores , provisionally this fall , they 'll sell for $399 , and that does n't include a pair of headphones decent enough to take advantage of the high-fidelity sound .  3 . the music $24.99 , according to the faq at ponomusic.com . the price for single songs has n't been set . neither , apparently , has the cut pono will take on music sales . apple , for instance , gets 30 per cent off the top . at sxsw , that question was met with a response from ceo john hamm ( no , not that one ) that was so evasive , even young conceded he did n't provide an answer .  and , as a couple of audience members at sxsw noted , a lot of us already own some music on record , cassette , cd and mp3 . we do n't want to buy it again .  4 . you can already buy the music in the same format and quality that the pono music store will be selling in october . as the sxsw presentation made explicit , pono is not a new format . it plays flac ( free lossless audio codec ) files . sites with extensive repertoires , such as hdtracks.com , already sell albums and tracks in the high and ultra-high using a unique digital filter ; we 'll have to wait til the fall to hear how much better it might sound .  5 . hippie values aside , part of us wishes that young 's system was aimed more at communal listening . the pitch video focused on listening to pono in your car , and young also mentioned headphones , but both of those scenarios feel like an extension of shuhei hosokawa 's famous " the walkman effect . " in other words , they encourage " self-enclosure . "  if you really long to go back to the way music used to be consumed , you might empathize with jacques attali 's words in noise : the political economy of music . he calls music " a tool for the creation or consolidation of a community . . . " pono does n't really seem like it 's built for that .  mind you , as a fan who has bought every piece of music young has released ( and some he has n't ) , we 've learned that his intentions are n't always -- and the fact that its kickstarter campaign raised $2 million in one day is a promising sign -- it could spark apple into making its players , phones and tablets flac-compatible .  that would be a win for everybody . and that we do get .  the vinyl countdown : official news about what many consider to be the vinyl event of 2014 , the expanded , remastered reissues of the first three led zeppelin albums , has been as rare as a phil kessel bodycheck . but after the invaluable twitter feed for ledzepnews spotted detailed listings for those releases on amazon 's u.k. site , the official word has finally arrived .  i , ii and iii will be released on june 3 as both single lps ( on 180-gram vinyl ) and deluxe-edition lps , which will include the original album remastered and additional discs of bonus material . ( the albums will also be released in one-cd and two-cd versions , as well as box sets containing the cds , the vinyl , high-def downloads , a book and more . )  led zeppelin i -- a legendary 1969 concert at paris 's olympia -- is streaming in its entirety on youtube . for now .  retro/active : though jethro tull 's one-song album thick as a brick appeared more than 40 years ago , ian anderson seems lately to have gotten the bug to revisit his epic concept album/parody of a concept album .  two years ago he released an official sequel . next month , anderson " reunites " with gerald bostock , the schoolboy poet/fictional lyricist at the centre of the original story , for homo erraticus . the central conceit is to set to music an old bostock manuscript to both revisit britain 's history and speculate on its future . you can get a small taste here .
