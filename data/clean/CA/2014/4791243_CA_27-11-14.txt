pkp and the pq : get ready for a weird year , canada  politics , like nature , abhors a vacuum . within hours of doug ford announcing that he was not running for the leadership of the ontario progressive conservatives , pierre karl peladeau confirmed that he will be a candidate for the leadership of the parti quebecois .  so any journalists out there who were worrying that canadian politics was going to run short of crazy in 2015 can rest easy -- and start uploading images of peladeau 's separatist fist-pump from the last quebec election campaign .  the announcements were as different as the two men themselves . ford 's was designed to remind ontarians that his family is a dynasty , dammit , so please pay attention . he convened a full-court press conference on the steps of his family business , deco , to announce that he is not running ... in this race . for now .  " we had a good ride with the press . i look forward to working with you for the next assembled press : maybe doug forgot that last year he said of journalists that " 80 per cent of them are nasty son of a guns " . no use dwelling on the past , though -- you 've got to move forward , as brother rob would say . )  in contrast , peladeau 's announcement displayed the self-assurance of a man accustomed to getting attention without even asking for it -- just because he is pkp . peladeau was giving a talk at the universit ? de montr ? al , musing about such things as imposing a toll on the st. lawrence seaway to generate revenues for an independent quebec . when asked by a student whether he would run for the leadership , he nonchalantly said that he 'd be picking up his nomination papers that afternoon .  granted , the ' impromptu ' statement was carried live on radio canada ; rumours had swirled all morning that he 'd announce his entry into the race . why do it there ? never one to underestimate his own importance , peladeau replied simply that " decisions have important implications for their respective races , and for provincial and federal politics . had ford run for the pc leadership , he would have imported the penny-pinching populism that characterized his campaign for toronto mayor , polarizing the debate with more moderate candidates -- christine elliott in particular -- and splitting the party along ideological lines . more fire and brimstone is the last thing many pc rank-and-file want ; they 're still smarting from their defeat this spring , thanks in large part to tim hudak 's zeal to fire 100,000 government employees .  as the liberals double down on austerity , disgruntled quebeckers are looking elsewhere . perhaps they forget that peladeau is far more right-of-center than the party he is seeking to lead -- and that he never met a union he did n't lock out .  on a personal level , ford running against elliott also would have been awkward ; she is the widow of former minister of finance jim flaherty -- a long-time ford family friend who publicly teared up when talking about the personal troubles facing rob ford . it took him close to five minutes of praising the other candidates to actually say the words . cp24 's political commentator remarked that it was almost as though he thought it up on the spot . the twitterati were less kind , many chirping that it 's the kiss of death for elliott 's campaign .  it probably is n't : like it or not , ford nation is part of the pc party , and all the candidates will be vying for their votes . elliott ca n't afford to turn them away ; other candidates , in particular barrie mp patrick brown , are selling memberships like hotcakes . how those voters are incorporated into the mix , and whether ford will actually hit the hustings with elliott , remains to be seen . it 's also highly possible that ford will run as a candidate for mpp in the next election , slated for 2018 -- and if the party loses that one , expect ford to make a move on the leadership at that time .  in quebec , peladeau says his candidacy has " even though many blame his pro-separatist statements for losing the pq the last election , polls today have peladeau leading his fellow candidates -- and say he 'd lead the liberals if he were heading the pq right now . a leger-le devoir poll released november 15 puts a pq-led peladeau at 36 per cent of the popular vote , compared to 30 per cent for the liberals , 19 per cent for the coailtion avenir quebec and 10 per cent for quebec solidaire .  how has this happened ? as the liberals double down on austerity , disgruntled quebeckers are looking elsewhere . perhaps they forget that peladeau is far more right-of-center than the party he is seeking to lead -- and that he never met a union he did n't lock out .  but you ca n't completely blame them : these days , peladeau has adopted more , er , socialist leanings . for example , on the government 's proposal to end universal daycare fees and charge by income , peladeau wrote on his facebook page that " while most western countries engage in the liberal government of philippe couillard is moving in the opposite direction . "  pro-natalist ? get ready , canada . if ( or at this point , when ) peladeau takes the helm of the pq , ottawa can brace itself for major headaches , the likes of which they have n't seen since the days of lucien bouchard . if harper could choose between that and a doug-ford led pc party , he would probably offer up 24 sussex for the next fordfest .  but that option is gone . instead , ottawa can brace itself for another year of ... crazy .  tasha kheiriddin is a political writer and broadcaster who frequently comments in both english and french . in her student days , tasha was active in youth politics in her hometown of montreal , eventually serving as national policy director and then president of the progressive conservative youth federation of canada . after practising law and a stint in the government of mike harris , tasha became the ontario director of the canadian taxpayers federation and co-wrote the 2005 bestseller , rescuing canada moved back to montreal in 2006 and served as vice-president of the montreal economic institute , and later director for quebec of the fraser institute , while also lecturing on conservative politics at mcgill university . tasha now lives in whitby , ontario with her daughter zara , born in 2009 .  the views , opinions and positions expressed by all ipolitics columnists and contributors are the author 's alone . they do not inherently or expressly reflect the views , opinions and/or positions of ipolitics.
