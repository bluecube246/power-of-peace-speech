brussels , belgium -- with a deafening thunder , the first nato awacs surveillance plane pierces the milky morning sky over germany 's geilenkirchen base , on its way to monitor the skies above ukraine .  listen very carefully , and you can also hear the nato alliance roaring back into the geopolitical arena .  quite a turnaround for a 65-year-old military organization increasingly condemned by many as a costly anachronism .  the crisis around ukraine " is providential from the point of view of nato , " said nick witney of the european council on foreign relations . " it gives it a new lease on life . "  nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen left tuesday for talks in washington bound to centre on the evolving crisis . and at the same time u.s. vice-president joe biden arrived in poland in a clear show that the united states , and nato , stands together with its worried partners in the military alliance .  on the same day , russian president vladimir putin approved the annexation of crimea and warned he russia 's " fence . "  " at a moment like this , we all appreciate in a special way the fact that we are in nato , " polish president bronislaw komorowski said recently .  the nato alliance was forged in the wake of world war ii , when the west was fighting the soviet union in a direct confrontation between free-market capitalism and communism , an ideological battle that basically sliced europe in two .  essential during the cold war when it faced the soviet-backed warsaw pact in a standoff involving thousands of nuclear missiles , nato 's role has been questioned since the demise of communism , and even more so after the balkan wars of the 1990s .  it has expanded to include many former warsaw pact members , and stretched its geographical title of north atlantic treaty organization to the limit with far-flung operations in afghanistan and libya . but it was putin who gave it fresh credibility with his incursion into ukraine 's crimean peninsula .  on top of the deployment of the awacs planes , britain decided monday to baltic air policing mission . the u.s. air force currently patrols air boundaries of the baltics with 10 f-15c eagle fighter jets .  last week , the united states deployed some 300 troops and a dozen f16 fighters to poland for joint exercises , but also to support its nato partner .  suddenly , nations that were once controlled by moscow crave nato 's protection .  " it would be hard to imagine any stronger guarantees of poland 's security , " komorowski said as his country marked 15 years of nato membership last week .  ukraine proves to be a case in point . it is a nato partner , but not a member , so it does not fall under the article 5 collective defence clause that states that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all .  if ukraine had had such protection , nato would have had to ensure military protection and go to war if necessary .  " yes . yes -- there is no question about that , " said steven blockmans of the centre for country , we would be talking about the invasion and occupation of a part of a country without that country 's central government 's consent . "  if russia were to do the same thing in a nato country , such as one of the baltic states that have a sizeable russian minority , " article 5 would describe an obligation to come to the defence of ( the country ) , including the use of armed forces , " blockmans said . " if russia were to take that gamble , there would be no stepping back from the brink of war for the nato allies . "  such is the fear of russia that some now want nato to send ground troops to the baltic states to counter moscow 's threat .  " increased presence of nato allies in our region would make sense , both militarily as well as serving as a deterrent , " estonian defence minister urmas reinsalu said on the same day the awacs took flight . " living next door to the big bear means that we need a solid defence changed reality in europe , where trade and co-operation between east and west seemed the future over the past decade . now , the continent is staring at confrontation .  witney of the foreign relations council said there is little alternative at this stage .  " it is necessary to respond in that sort of way . otherwise , it is possible that putin and those around him could misinterpret it as a sort of terminal weakness of the west . "  " it will be a resumption of institutional attitudes that will last for a good many years .
