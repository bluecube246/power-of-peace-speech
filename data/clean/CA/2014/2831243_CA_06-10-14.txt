In their press conferences on Sunday , both Edmonton Oilers general manager Craig MacTavish and head coach Dallas Eakins were very careful to emphasize that the final cuts made by the team represented a snapshot in time and that they should n't be misrepresented as more than that .  " This is n't permanent , " MacTavish said . " This is to start the year . There are always going to be injuries , there is always going to be performance issues . It 's not that we ca n't unwind ; the only decision we really could n't unwind would be demoting Darnell Nurse . "  " It 's not a final blow , " added Eakins , after emphasizing the extreme disappointment of some players . " I think that 's the hardest thing to get through to the guys today , that everybody thinks the team was picked today . Well , the team was picked for Game 1 . After Game 1 things change . "  Both of them are right , of course . It would be a a reversible choice made before a single NHL game had been played . But the decision to demote Martin Marincin to the minor leagues puts an exclamation point on the fact that there is a logjam of young defencemen on the left side of the depth chart , and that Marincin may be on the outside of that group looking in long-term .  There are three exceptional young left-shooting defencemen that competed for NHL jobs in training camp , and Marincin had an advantage in two areas : age and NHL experience . His disadvantage is that in their respective draft years Nurse and Oscar Klefbom were more highly-regarded , and that their eventual ceiling based on their individual skills could well be higher :  Those advantages matter more right now than they will at any point in the future ; with each passing day and game they become less important because the gap narrows . The difference between a 22-year-old and a 19-year-old is bigger than the difference between a 23-year-old and 20-year-old because the biggest leaps are made at the youngest ages .  The Oilers could a difficult thing for a team hoping to turn a corner to do . Andrew Ference has three years left on his contract , while Nikita Nikitin has two ; both guys can also play on the right side but there is at most one spot over there between Jeff Petry ( one-year deal ) , Mark Fayne ( four-year deal ) and Justin Schultz ( one-year deal , but the organization clearly loves him like a son ) .  The point here is that it 's very , very easy to imagine a scenario where the organization talks itself into seeing Marincin as redundant . There are lots of bodies at the position , and while someone like me might feel that Marincin 's body of work ( both training camp and last season ) indicates that he 's a better player right now than Klefbom ( excellent in many ways , the Swede trails Marincin significantly in terms of decision-making and use of his stick to defend ) , that does n't matter if the folks running the team feel that Marincin does n't have a discernible edge , that might not matter , but the Oilers are not a really good team ; they 're a team with needs in many areas . Marincin will have value league-wide ; he 's cheap , has a range of skills and has proven an ability to handle NHL-level competition . We also know the Vancouver Canucks asked for him when they were shopping Cory Schneider .  Edmonton could well find itself in a position where it has a chance at adding a significant player , but needs to send back somebody both cheap and with real upside . There are n't a lot of guys on the roster who fit that description , and even fewer in positions the Oilers might think they can afford to subtract from .  This is all hypothetical , of course , and the situation could change in any number of unforeseeable ways as the season goes on . But the Oilers are going to have to make a decision on their blue line in the not-too-distant future , and right now it 's pretty obvious where the team sees Marincin relative to to share their views on our articles and blog posts .
