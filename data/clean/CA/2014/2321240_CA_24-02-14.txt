<h> Ontario 's police watchdog , in a third review of the police shooting caught on video , will consider how officers treat people in a mental health crisis . <p> Ontario 's independent police review director , Gerry McNeilly , speaks at a 2012 news conference . He has announced OIPRD 's second-ever review , this one into Toronto police use of force tactics in response to public uproar over the shooting death of Sammy Yatim , caught on bystander video last summer . <p> Ontario 's police watchdog says it is time for change within the Toronto force and has launched an independent review into use-of-force tactics and police treatment of people with mental illness . <p> The new public probe by the Office of the Independent Police Review Director is only the second of its kind since the agency was formed in October 2009 . It will focus on the Toronto service , looking at officer training as well as how officers interact with the public -- specifically those in crisis or experiencing mental illness . <p> A final report containing recommendations will be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OIPRD 's first review , which looked policing during the G20 summit in 2010 , released in 2012 , also focused heavily on the Toronto police and included some scathing criticism of institutional failures and alleged misconduct . <p> Director Gerry McNeilly said the latest review was spurred by public complaints , which have focused increasingly on police use-of-force policies , and recent high-profile shootings -- including that of 18-year-old Sammy Yatim , who died last summer after being shot and Tasered on a Dundas streetcar . <p> In an interview with the Star from his 10th floor Bay St. office just a block from police headquarters , McNeilly said many of the key issues from the G20 report remain problematic today . <p> " We made some specific recommendations around training , around better communication , around giving better information to members of the public when they are interacting with police officers . In my view , we need to keep talking about that , " McNeilly said . " I hope my recommendations this time will be stronger , will be actually adopted and be implemented , because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OIPRD is the third body to launch a probe in the wake of public outrage that surrounded Yatim 's shooting . <p> In August , Chief Bill Blair announced an internal probe of the death led by retired Supreme Court Justice Frank Iacobucci . <p> The same month , Ontario Ombudsman Andre Marin announced his office would be looking into provincial guidelines for police on how to de-escalate potentially violent situations . <p> McNeilly said his review would be distinctive . <p> " I 'm doing it from a public-interest perspective , in regards to the public complaint system , " he said . " Like any other citizen I looked at this matter and had some concerns about it . " <p> The OIPRD can not enforce any changes stemming from its recommendations . McNeilly said he shares the public 's concern that past recommendations from various agencies have not been successfully implemented , and hopes that will change . <p> " Maybe it 's time for the government to do something about it , " McNeilly said . " Police services do a really good job of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we expect them to . But what 's been tried and old , sometimes we need to review it . " <p> The new review will also consider the findings of a recent inquest into the shooting deaths of three people who had experienced mental illness and were carrying scissors or a knife when they were killed by Toronto officers . <p> Peter Rosenthal , a Toronto lawyer who represented the family of 29-year-old Michael Eligon at the inquest , said the OIPRD review is welcome . But he said the inquest has already outlined both the problem and solution in a clear way . <p> The inquest heard officers are trained to deal with the behaviour someone exhibits , and not the condition that may be affecting them . <p> Among its dozens of recommendations , the jury said officers should be trained to account for the possibility the person they are confronting is in a mental or emotional crisis , for example by offering verbal help and understanding rather than just yelling intimidating orders . <p> " It was astonishing to me that no officer did that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They should have been talking to him , not killing him . . . Those recommendations should be implemented today , because it might kill somebody tomorrow . " <p> The review will seek not only to review the police service 's policy and procedures and determine best practices , but will also examine tools such as Tasers , how training is given , and how previous recommendations have been implemented . <p> Ian Scott , former director of the Special Investigations Unit -- which investigates all police interactions involving serious injury -- told the Star that while such reviews can be helpful , a lasting concern is making sure police forces fully cooperate in investigations . <p> " The lamentable fact is there will be other fatalities in the future , " Scott said . " What 's important in terms of trying to prevent future deaths is to have a thorough understanding of what happened each time . " <p> Scott said part of that , and what should be considered in the OIPRD 's review , is looking at video capabilities to document police interactions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be testing in a pilot project . <p> Yatim 's death , which was caught on bystander video , " revolutionized the public 's view of these matters , " Scott said . <p> The review itself will include any available video and audio as well as other documents and public input . <p> Police spokesperson Mark Pugash said the service would " co-operate fully " with the OIPRD review , " as we have with the other reviews being done on the same issue . " <p> Toronto Police Services Board chair Alok Mukherjee said the board has given the OIPRD its " full support and cooperation . " <p> " I think the fact that OIPRD have decided to conduct the systemic review is a further acknowledgement of public concern of use-of-force by the police , " said Mukherjee , who also spoke publicly about those concerns following Yatim 's shooting . <p> Mukherjee pointed out how the board sought to have its own lawyer at the now-concluded inquest into the other shootings , and that 30 of 74 recommendations made by the jury were also proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to see a greater focus on the police use of alternatives to lethal force , " Mukherjee said .
