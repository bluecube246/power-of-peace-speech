<h> Hoilett responds to campaign allegations <p> While campaigning for friends at the University of Toronto , incoming Ryerson Students ' Union ( RSU ) president Rajean Hoilett allegedly misrepresented himself as a U of T student , according to an article published on the campus newspaper 's website . <p> On March 13 , The Varsity , U of T 's student-run newspaper , published an article investigating claims of outside student executives helping current vice-president of equity and presidential hopeful , Yolen Bollo-Kamara , campaign at the school 's St. George campus . <p> Among the executives from York University and Ryerson encouraging U of T students to vote for friends running for executive positions in the University of Toronto student union ( UTSU ) election under the slate U of T Voice were Melissa Palermo and Hoilett . <p> Like members of the RSU , Bollo-Kamara is a member of the Canadian Federation of Students Ontario ( CFS-O ) . <p> Titled , " U of T Voice 's use of RSU , YFS campaigners draws criticsm , " the article says that a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an interview . <p> The article also says that Hoilett initially identified himself as a U of T student before admitting he was a Ryerson student . <p> Hoilett denies these claims , adding furthermore that the journalist never identified themselves as a reporter . <p> " I did n't identify as a U of T student . I was asked if I have a TCard -- which is their equivalent to our OneCard , " Hoilett said . " I said I 'm a Ryerson student , I 'm helping out a friend . I declined to do an interview and that was the article that was published . " <p> Joshua Oliver , The Varsity 's editor-in-chief , stands by his paper 's story . <p> " When Rajean was first approached by a reporter who said they were working for The Varsity , he said that he was a U of T student but did n't answer any other questions , " Oliver added . <p> Reporters at The Varsity made efforts to contact Hoilett before the article was published , but still have not received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond when we reached out to him , " Oliver said . " If he disagrees with what the reporter said , he never communicated that to us and I have no reason to believe that what the reporter said is n't accurate . " <p> This is the first year that The Varsity has sent out their writers to report on the campaigning for the union , after yearly reports that Ryerson , York and other CFS-O students are helping to campaign . <p> Oliver told his reporters to cover the campaign , introduce themselves as a reporter and interview everyone they saw campaigning . <p> Both Hoilett and Palermo said they used their vacation time to help campaign . RSU executives get two weeks vacation allotted each year . Hoilett said he took about three or four days of personal time to help . <p> " Yolen is a friend of mine and I 'm excited that she 's running for president of her students ' union , " Palermo said . " When she asked me if I could help campaign , I told her I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " <p> Both RSU members were seen on Tuesday , March 11 and on Wednesday , March 12 at polling stations around the U of T campus . <p> But while bringing off-campus support to help campaign is permitted under U of T election rules , misrepresentation is not . <p> On March 13 , the chief returning officer ( CRO ) received a complaint that presidential candidate Bollo-Kamara and vice-president of internal and services candidate , Cameron Wathey , violated election procedure codes . <p> According to the CRO 's ruling announced March 14 , upon investigation she determined that Bollo-Kamara and Wathey violated an article under " responsibility of the candidates " after a " volunteer misrepresented their status as a student at the University of Toronto . " <p> Both Bollo-Kamara and Wathey received two demerit points for " misrepresentation of facts . " Hoilett said that he has not heard of anything regarding the CRO report and had no comment . <p> " Candidates under our rules are held responsible for the actions of the people volunteering for them , " Oliver said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misrepresentation of facts , one of the things you can get demerit points for in our election . " <p> The Eyeopener was unable to confirm if these violations were related to the allegations surrounding Hoilett . <p> " It did n't specify the volunteer , it did n't specify the occasion so it 's not clear in the ruling that it 's referring to this incident , " Oliver said . " Although it 's obviously possible . " <h> Pages <h> Categories <h> Contact Us <p> Have a news tip ? Story pitch ? Want to volunteer ? Dying to comment about something you read in the paper ?
