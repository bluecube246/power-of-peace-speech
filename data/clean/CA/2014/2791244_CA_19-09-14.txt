<h> RCMP investigating after bees poisoned <h> A Manitoba beekeeper is out thousands of dollars after his bees were the target of truly poisonous wrath <p> Piles of dead bees were reportedly two inches thick in front of the affected hives , with others spread over the whole bee yard . Photo : Submitted <p> It 's a sting being felt by beekeepers across province . <p> And now the deliberate poisoning of hundreds of thousands of bees at multiple locations in the Rural Municipality of Elton has left apiarists and the RCMP looking for answers . <p> " We came to the first yard and there were just piles of dead bees all over on the ground , we had been going there to pick up honey , but the honey boxes were completely empty except for more dead bees , " said Jason Loewen , operator of the Steinbach-based Loewen Honey Farms . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " Right in front of the hives they were an inch to two inches thick , but then the whole yard , which is probably 30 feet wide and 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead bees . " <p> Provincial apiarist , Rheal Lafreniere , said he has never encountered a case like this in his nearly two decades on the job . <p> " The important thing -- if you think it 's chemical related -- is to get a sample and try to preserve that sample as much as possible , because you 're going two have to identify what was the causing agent , " Lafreniere said . <p> And while some viruses can mimic the effects of insecticides , such as neurological impairment , he added that external factors in this case appear to make it likely that the cause of death was not natural . <p> Loewen notes that a sticky residue was found on top of the affected hives , which has now been sent for analysis , along with samples of dead bees and material from inside the hives . <p> Furthermore , threats had been previously made against the affected hives . <p> " It was another beekeeper , " Loewen said . " He had threatened to burn the hives , because I guess he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to put the bees on the farmer 's land . " <p> Brandon RCMP are now appealing for public for assistance , asking anyone with information on the matter to contact them directly or through Crime Stoppers . <p> It is believed that the bee yards , located six and 10 miles northwest of Brandon , were attacked sometime between August 14 and September 3 . <p> He estimates it will cost about $18,000 to replace the destroyed colonies , and said he is also out between $15,000 and $20,000 in lost honey revenue . The frames and boxes will also likely need to be replaced . <p> " Now we 'll just take care of the remaining hives , and we 'll probably have to buy more in the spring , " said the beekeeper , adding he is also considering installing some security features in the bee yards to prevent future attacks . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " If some one does that sort of thing , you have to wonder what else they might do , " said Loewen . " Obviously he does n't enjoy what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same creatures if he did . " <p> Allan Campbell , president of the Manitoba Beekeepers Association , said there has been some confusion in mainstream media reports about the nature of the bee deaths , associating the massive die-off to routine pesticide use , but he stressed that this was not the case and that it 's important people are aware that this was a deliberate act . <p> " It is starting a conversation , though , " he added , noting that beekeeping is an industry unlike any other . <p> " Bees are pretty unique in that they are livestock on the one hand , but on the other hand they 're not fenced or caged , and they do have a tendency to go out and they will fly up to two miles really , to collect nectar and pollen , " he said . <p> " Sometimes conflicts arise with neighbours , who maybe have a swimming pool that is attracting bees , or maybe their flower beds are full of bees and they 're nervous about working there with them , and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication and forming relationships , " said Campbell . " Normally you can resolve issues without having to poison somebody else 's hives. "
