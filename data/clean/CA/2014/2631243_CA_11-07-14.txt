Why Quebec is closed for business
http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/why-quebec-business-is-closed/

it 's been a little more than a month since the liberal government of quebec premier philippe couillard released its belt-tightening budget , and since then everyone from movie producers and doctors to teachers and mayors has griped about the cuts it promises . they should n't be surprised . couillard campaigned on a pledge to fix quebec 's " economic fiasco . " but a new report from the c.d. howe institute offers a stark reminder of how difficult that task will be .  the report , authored by philip cross , the former chief economist at statistics canada , shows the extent to which the economies of ontario , quebec and the maritimes now rely on public sector versus private sector investment for growth . condensed version : a whole honking lot . investment spending refers to money spent on structures , machinery and equipment , and since 2000 , the report notes , public sector investment as a share of gdp has nearly doubled in quebec to almost six per cent . at the same time , business investment -- you know , . that 's put quebec near the bottom of the pack , alongside ontario , and a notch above new brunswick and nova scotia . " business investment is the lifeblood of economic growth , " cross wrote in an opinion piece . " it determines what the economy will look like years from now , and how competitive its workers will be . "  of course , to have business investment , you 've got to have businesses . and that 's where quebec faces serious problems that run far deeper than any single austerity budget can hope to tackle . in december , statistics canada released a largely overlooked research paper that examined the rates at which new businesses have been joining and leaving the marketplace in each province . the creation of new firms and the destruction of old ones , through consolidation or closure , is key to a vibrant economy , bringing in new ideas and innovations and forcing existing businesses to pick up their game . you can probably guess where quebec ranked , but i 'll tell you anyway . from 2000 to " than quebec . in fact , in the manufacturing , retail , transportation and finance sectors , more companies went away than were created . no other province had that level of " destruction " without the customarily accompanying " creative . "  it gets worse . another report from a few months ago , the global entrepreneurship monitor , measured the levels of entrepreneurialism across canada . it did so by looking at the percentage of working-age adults who are either engaged in setting up a business or who own a wage-paying business that 's existed for less than 42 months . on that front , too , quebec came dead last , with an entrepreneurship rate of 9.6 per cent , compared to 11.9 per cent in ontario and close to 19 per cent in alberta .  source : global entrepreneurship monitor  sylvain carle , an entrepreneur in montreal who 's started several companies , recently shared an anecdote with the montreal gazette that sums up quebec 's sluggish start-up culture . while attending a conference at stanford university , a speaker had asked how own companies , and 105 hands went up , since some were multi-preneurs . when carle asked the same question to a similar-sized audience in montreal a few weeks later , five hands went up .  it does n't take an advanced degree in rocketry to know why all this is the case . for decades quebec businesses have been plagued with repeated bouts of separation anxiety and the constant irritant of the province 's language police . the province punishes businesses with some of the highest taxes in north america , yet it has rung up a $2.4-billion deficit and a debt load equal to half its gdp , the highest in the country . when not arbitrarily overriding the rights of shareholders to protect underperforming quebec companies , the government has flip-flopped on its attitude toward resource development . in short , it 's an economic environment layered with uncertainty , instability and state interference .  for the longest time , the solution from the quebec government to its stagnant business environment was more quebec government , in the form of state-sponsored funds doling out cheques to past march , the caisse de d ? p ? t et placement du qu ? bec pension fund , that bastion of economic nationalism , joined with desjardins group to create a fund to pump $230 million into small and medium-sized enterprises , having already distributed $190 million to 186 other companies through an earlier fund . and yet the level of business creation is stuck in neutral .  this is what couillard faces . he 's said all the right things about tackling quebec 's fiscal crisis : " the time for cosmetic changes is gone , " he said in his throne speech in may . " we must act firmly and decisively . and we will . " his far bigger challenge remains to make quebec a place where entrepreneurs would want to set up shop . the best way he can do that is to get his government out of the way .  filed under :  advertisement  about this author  jason kirby is a columnist and business editor at maclean 's . working in toronto and vancouver he 's covered money has been nominated for three national magazine awards .  why quebec is closed for business  " statistics canada released a largely overlooked research paper that examined the rates at which new businesses have been joining and leaving the marketplace in each province ... "  it 's not just quebec . when the last manufacturing sector leaves canada , so to will our pensions , health-care , and education . ... and then the doctors , engineers , technologists , ... , will leave . welcome to harp 's future , when canada finally becomes nothing but fetchers ' of trees , crude , and water , with only harps rich 1%'ers left .  oh yes it is all harper 's fault . ignore what the various provincial governments have been doing ( which has a bigger effect on the decisions of businesses ) .  for the most part , the federal government has little day to day influence on canadians -- it is provincial governments that are the bigger factor in our day to day lives . as this article points out -- duh .  hold any significant property in quebec or east . even reducing holdings of ontario companies as i just sold one the other day .  why is simple , they lose investors money and the system is run by economic idiots . lets talk usd or yuan , as they are world currencies and prices are based on these currencies and nit small canada .  say i invested $100,000 in ontario/quebec/pei/ns/nl a year ago . say i even make a 5% profit which is very rare . so i have $105,000 less $2000 in taxes for a $103,000 in money . but wait , cad money depreciated so in usd i have $95,800 , a whooping $4,200 ( 4.2% ) loss in purchasing power .  hits people in food , utility , gasoline and other costs too , so they have less to spend on each others jobs .  and what drives it ? simple , govmint debt . no legitimate lenders are lending canada the hundreds of billions of govmint debt , boc creates the electronic counterfeit out of thin air to devalue money and in the debt .  fact is we have uncommon good bloated , wasteful , bailouts , other peoples money for nothing of value and debt to the unborn for a madness of financially irresponsible governments .  hey , our young ca n't afford family homes or kids buy single bed condos , as we are all too busy supporting govmint kids and well conditioned not to question our governments on the wastes .  its going to be at least as bad as the 70s , 1969 home went from $14,800 to 1979 price of $97,000 .... hyper-stagflation and govmint will lie about real inflation . but fact is canada is going to be devalued and why i now invest all new moneys , and some old ones too into us and international . getting far better returns too .  until economic sanity and fairness return to ontario east and bc , its just going to get worse . in depreciating cad , my foreign roi in the last 8 months in terms of cad is 7.5% x ( 14.4% ( gain ) + 4.34% ( div ) + 7.5%  in fact , given the poor performances of many oil/resource stocks , i would say even the west is failing , and why the last 9 stock purchases were all outside of canada .  hey , jobs go south as us and mexico do n't have the hidden and real tax bloats to support , and as a result can work for less and have more . investments go south for the same reason , else union and governemtn greed for a return above inflation plus taxes so you do n't lose vale .  now if my wife let us move out of canada , i could save a whole lot on taxes too .... as i hate supporting so many freeloaders in canada that punish productive non-govmint working people at the till and the pay tax greeds .  canadians have to earn $1,400,000 to pay $700,000 in taxes , $300,000 in fair interest , to buy a $400,000 home that is $200,000 in labour , fees , tariffs and other taxes to build the tax-debt out $200,000 home .  mexican earns $200,000 to pay $40,000 home . ( also pays a whole lost less in city/utility/education taxes too ) .  american earns $360,000 to pay $60,000 in taxes , $50,000 in interest ( tax adjusted ) to buy a $250,000 home . ( also pays a whole lost less in city/utility/education taxes too ) .  my buddy in usa had his roof done , $6800 , me , its costing me $12,800 for near identical home . as in canada were are taxed like slaves . but hey , its $6000 i do n't spend on someone else 's job . hey , raise my dentists taxes , i get the bill and have less to spend on other peoples jobs . with devalued money , i have less to spend on other peoples jobs to make the goods and services .  reality is , we require uncommunicative inflated wage demands to live in canada , so energizer looks as montreal as a high cost , money losing venture ... and is going to close it . same reasons caterpiller , kelloggs , heinz , bombardier and a lot of others are laying the economics insanity of socialist-statism corruption in canada and how much it really costs them for this waste , canada is on a downhill ride . btw , i am a 1 or 2%er ..... retired early .  want jobs ? get some economic sanity . look for win-win-win and not win-lose-lose .... no one wants to play with losers to lose .  you are right , as a 2%er canadian investor , if the core business is in any of bc , manitoba , ontario , quebec , pei , nb , nl i simply do not invest . reasons are simple as very few make value for investors . sure , they return 2% dividends for some , but money was devalued 7.5% in the same period , a 6% or more value loss after taxes .  if you as a investor ca n't get a return rate of ( inflation+currency devaluation+taxes ) then you are negative value investing . if i invested $1000 last year , but takes $1075 to buy the same stuff this year , a $1020 2% return does n't cut it .  its why i know statscan lies about real inflation . you can see the costs rise in housing materials , appliances , autos , iron , food and more ... companeis get hit with this too evaporating their already pathetic returns to shareholders and thats before union and tax greed costs . its why energizer , heinz , caterpillar , bombardier and a lot of others are laying off or closing up .  you bet its not just quebec , i do not buy any debt instruments below 10% ( which today is zero ) , i do not invest unless i can get total returns of 10% or more as that is the value break even amount .  rich get richer as they do the math and account for inflation and currency value . canada is a depreciating tax inflated economy of debt fraud .  i can handle cra annual audits , they see 3 times the earnings and love to snoop for investment tips .... from this offshore " mass painted " cheater that does n't cheat . 3 audits in 10 years , .  i am even declining western canada investments as weakness is like cancer , it eventually takes out the the whole host . canada ca n't afford the govmint bloat , waste and other peoples money for nothing greed any longer , its downhill here in . with gains below inflation , canada is a loser until it gets more economic fairness .  i hear you , i have worked overseas for over 5 years , and the labour/materials to build a small villa/home , lets say , in antigua , for example , is about 3 times less than it is here ! , and i 'm talking quality built . it 's amazing how much our ( canadian ) gov't screws everybody over here .  with the sheer amount of the billions upon billions of annual tax dollars that the canadian ( fereal/provincial ) govt 's steal from us , there is no reason at all why all canadians could n't enjoy better health-care for their families , free education , 100% dental-care , ...  we can start with , ahem , the separatists and about french being in peril and english being far too big for its britches . their egos , and their egos alone , are keeping us chained to the bottom . riots could n't stop us . wars could n't stop us . but the threat of separation ( not the least bit helped by the return of gilles duceppe at the last second ) wrecked a once-powerful metropolis and turned it into a shell of its former self .  notice : your email may not yet have been verified . please check your email , click the link to verify your address , and then submit your comment . if you ca n't find this email , access your profile editor to re-send the confirmation email . you must have a verified email to submit a comment . once you have done so , check again .  sign in / sign up  with your existing account from  with an email account  commenters who signed up before june 26th , 2014 will have to reregister on our new , social-friendly login system . the good news and you 're welcome to use the same email address .  almost done !  please confirm the information below before signing up .  * #socialregistrationform * * **27;128;toolong * * **26;157;toolong * * **30;185;toolong * * **29;217;toolong * by clicking " create account " , i confirm that i have read and understood each of the website terms of service and privacy policy and that i agree to be bound by them .
