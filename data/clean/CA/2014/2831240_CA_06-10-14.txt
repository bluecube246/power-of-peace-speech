two weeks ago 17-year-old adam keunen was killed in an accident while on a high-school co-op placement . adam 's death marks the third death of a student engaged in work-integrated learning in the last 10 months in ontario . like the deaths of aaron murray and wayne affleck , this situation raises serious questions about workplace protections for students who are increasingly participating in work-integrated learning programs at high schools , colleges and universities .  over the past decade work-integrated learning has emerged as a key part of ontario 's secondary and post-secondary education system . while co-operative education , internships , and other training programs for students have enormous advantages , they lack appropriate oversight and regulation by our provincial government and educational institutions . the courts , academic researchers , and the ministry of labour have all recognized that students and young workers are particularly vulnerable in the workplace . young people at the start of their careers often do not have the experience or knowledge to identify or avoid potentially hazardous situations .  in ontario , students engaged in unpaid work-integrated safety act or the employment standards act , 2000 . under the workplace safety and insurance act students receive protections only in certain circumstances . this lack of regulatory protection may have contributed to the deaths of these young men , and closing these loopholes could help prevent similar accidents in the future .  premier kathleen wynne should address this situation by taking the following steps .  first , she should appoint an independent third party to conduct a full review of work-integrated learning programs in ontario at the secondary and post-secondary levels . this review must critically assess the appropriateness of the work being performed by co-op students , whether these programs have sufficient oversight , and whether or not students are being given sufficient training in preparation for their placements . this type of review is not without precedence in canada ; the alberta government launched a similar review in the wake of death of andy ferguson , who died while completing an academic internship at a radio station .  second , students need to be treated as de facto employees and extended greater protections with and workers ' compensation . the ontario government has introduced the stronger workplaces for a stronger economy act . this bill would give co-op students the protections under the health and safety act that other workers already enjoy . the government should move quickly to pass this bill , along with mpp peggy sattler 's greater protection for interns and vulnerable employees act , which would grant co-op students basic protections under the employment standards act . if ontario is going to continue to expand work-integrated learning programs then students and their parents need to be confident that they possess some modicum of protection while in the workplace .  third , the ministry of labour must begin proactive inspections of workplaces where students are engaged in work-integrated learning programs . the ministry of labour needs to work with other ministries , secondary and post-secondary institutions , organized labour , and student groups to develop an inspection program that ensures that employers are taking the necessary precautions to protect students who are in the workplace .  we hope that if these recommendations are implemented we will see a reduction in common in this province .
