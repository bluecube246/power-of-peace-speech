Couple 's ' love nest on the Bow ' one of first Calgary houses to be demolished Add to ...  From the front of the house , it still looks like the charming post-war abode it once was . The gravel driveway is neat , the paint is fresh , and only the yellow tape blocking access to the yard gives away the fact that this house has more serious damage than its neighbours .  It takes a walk to the side yard to see the precarious six-metre hole below this Bowness neighbourhood house .  Video  video  When Bow River flood waters rushed in on the night of June 20 , part of the old brick foundation of the house washed away and water flowed directly into the basement .  Now , what used to be a downstairs studio space and bathroom looks like a muddy cave , filed with an assortment of tossed household items including a wrapping-paper roll , a binder and a bookshelf .  Eleven days after floods hit , Calgary continues a cleanup and rebuilding effort collectively will cost billions .  Amid the state of emergency , city safety officers have been scouring the worst-hit neighbourhoods around the clock to pinpoint dangerous homes like this -- where the structure is fragile , and the inhabitants will never be allowed to return .  " The house is coming down , " said Scott Miller , a city safety codes officer who has been working every day to assess damage in homes since the floods hit .  Mr. Miller was the one to tell Geoff Wilcox and his wife Sharon Raycroft that their white 1947 house nestled on the banks of the Bow River -- which more resembles an Ontario lakefront cottage than a city home -- will be one of the first of many Calgary buildings that city safety inspectors order demolished as a result of the floods .  " I 've lived in Calgary all my life and this is all so strange , " Mr. Miller said .  The number of homes that will be written off is still unknown . But Calgary 's Emergency Management Agency says as many as significant period of time , and the city believes at least 2,400 houses are damaged .  " Sharon had it fixed up like a little jewel box , " Mr. Wilcox , 55 , a geologist , said of his house . " It was our love nest on the Bow . "  While some of the homes around them have been deemed structurally sound , the house they 've lived in for the past 21 years will be torn down within the week . The water reached as high as 30 centimetres on the 800-square-foot main floor , where the floor is now so warped the front door wo n't open .  The couple managed to salvage the pale apricot dress Ms. Raycroft 's mother wore on her wedding day in the 1920s , and her parents ' old oak piano , but lost their photo albums .  Now they are deciding whether to rebuild , and where to land .  " Calgary is a beautiful city , and the people are great , " Mr. Wilcox said . " But it 's an expensive time . Already it 's hard to get drywall in this city . "  Many Calgarians are being forced to make the same kind of big choices .  Just across the Bow River from Mr. Wilcox and Ms. Raycroft 's property , the land behind a church and several homes had sunk or eroded away to the point where one house no longer has a yard , just a deck perched above the embankment .  The Calgary Real Estate Board said house listings will fall and house sales in flood-affected neigbourhoods will face price discounts in the short term .  But over all , the board 's president Becky Walters said the city 's resale market is strong enough to weather the " terrible event . "  Other Alberta communities were hard hit as well , most notably High River , the 13,000-person town south of Calgary which saw the worst of Alberta 's flood damage .  While the Alberta government has pledged as much as $10,000 per household in immediate help for homeowners affected by the flood , a broader , more expensive , for the damages or the loss of an entire house -- especially one in many of the wealthy Calgary neighbourhoods such as Roxboro , Rideau Park and Elbow Park that were some of the most badly flooded neighbourhoods -- will be a difficult question .  Even Mayor Naheed Nenshi has noted the province faces a quandary : how to structure an aid program that could end up helping the richest people in the city in the wake of the disaster .  " Some of the homes in the city are very expensive homes , but not all of them , " Mr. Nenshi said last week .  " There 's a wide variety of people who have been impacted at every part of the socio-economic scale . And this will be interesting for the province , frankly -- if I can be a pundit for just a second -- as they 're developing their disaster relief plans , they 're going to have to think hard about that question .
