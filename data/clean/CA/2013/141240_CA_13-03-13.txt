<h> ' Big Brother Canada ' : Behind-The-Scenes At A Live Taping <p> Last Thursday I had the opportunity to attend the taping of a " Big Brother Canada " elimination episode . <p> I ventured out into the scary unknown of the suburbs and joined up with other " Big Brother Canada " fans to see just what goes on in that mysterious studio . Here are some things I observed : <p> 1 . The studio is difficult to find . It 's in the middle of nowhere , out in the vast suburbia of the Greater Toronto Area . When I got off the bus , I wandered around for about 10 minutes , desperately trying to avoid getting lost in a place that appeared to have undergone The Rapture . I finally had to bite the bullet and ask the first stranger I saw for directions , and he looked at me as if my non-threatening exterior was just a fa ? ade hiding a potential axe murderer . <p> 2 . I waited with the die-hard " Big Brother Canada " fans outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio opened to us . Shout-out to the guy in front of me , who was wearing a nice suit and a bright orange scarf . Bold choice , sir . <p> 3 . The studio holds three sections of chairs -- one of which is partially behind the stage , so I 'm not sure what they were looking at -- at the front of the 11 , 000 sq . ft . " Big Brother Canada " house . A few different textures ( like brick and stucco ) are projected onto the side of the white house to make it look more realistic . The episode we were watching was also projected onto the side . <p> 4 . The chairs are extremely close together . If you do n't like rubbing bums with strangers ( and who does n't ? ) , you probably do n't want to attend a " Big Brother Canada " taping . <h> How do you feel about the first season of " Big Brother Canada " ? <p> 5 . When I walked into the studio , at least four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I like to think this is their only task . <p> 6 . At commercial breaks , we had the opportunity to win " Big Brother Canada " merchandise ( shot glasses , beer koozies , and t-shirts ) but as we had to either dance or answer " Big Brother " trivia ( neither of which I can do ) , I refrained . <p> 7 . I did n't anticipate how much applauding there would be . We had to applaud when Arisa entered the studio at the beginning , before and after every commercial break , whenever anyone answered a trivia question correctly , whenever a new person appeared on the stage , and whenever Arisa or the producer asked us how we were feeling or whether we were excited . Have mercy on our hands , BBCan . <p> 8 . People are crazy about " Big Brother . " Some audience members have a seemingly photographic memory for details of every single " Big Brother " episode , from all versions of the show . <p> 9 . Arisa Cox is awesome . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of TV ( like " Downton Abbey , " " the Walking Dead , " and " the Vampire Diaries " ) . <p> 10 . My audience overwhelmingly thought that Peter would win the whole thing , with Gary a close second . Only four people thought that A.J. would win it all , and they were all members of his family . Poor guy . <p> Tune in to Slice for new episodes on Wednesdays , Thursdays , and Sundays ; " Big Brother After Dark " seven days a week ; or go online for the 24-hour live feed . <p> Close <p> ? <p> " Big Brother Canada " Season 1 Cast <p> of <p> ? <p> ? <p> Toronto socialite with a passion for fashion . <p> A sweet dental hygienist from Scarborough , this gem is single and ready to mingle . <p> This calculating professional YouTuber from New Brunswick approaches everything like a mathematical equation . <p> A self-proclaimed party girl from Fort McMurray who knows how to get what she wants . <p> Quick on his feet , this slick salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A small town elementary school teacher from Nova Scotia with a big personality . <p> An adorable and innocent East Coast farm boy with a strong work ethic and a heart of gold . <p> An exotic Persian beauty from Edmonton who 's out to prove there is more to her than what meets the eye . <p> Cocky but lovable , this doctoral student from Vancouver believes his PhD in Social Psychology is his key to the grand prize . <p> Free-spirited and sporty , this tomboy from Toronto loves life and is n't afraid of a little competition . <p> A hopeless romantic and charming down-home East Coaster . <p> A thrill-seeking tanning salon owner from Toronto who works hard and plays even harder . <p> A sweet , smart , super fan from Richmond Hill who plans to do his thesis on " Big Brother .
