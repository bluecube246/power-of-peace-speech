<h> video <h> video <p> If you said ( f ) , you 're right . In the perfumed salons of Rosedale , Toronto 's gilded midtown neighbourhood , I have heard people whisper about another that " she really should do something about those lines " as though a shot of Botox is a matter of simple maintenance , like having your leaves blown off your lawn . To not do it is seen as a failure of community manners . <p> I have also observed women who submit to the facial needle out of a sense of obligation to their physical beauty . They may never say this , of course , but the sentiment is there . That their effort to preserve it often goes awry and they end up looking like plastic versions of themselves ( I 'm looking at you , Nicole Kidman ) is not the point . It 's often a function of identity : They are their beauty . Not to try to sustain it is akin to not fully using the brain you were born with . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a grouch when they do n't feel they are . In her book Lots of Candles , Plenty of Cake , Anna Quindlen , the 60-year-old novelist and journalist who famously chronicled thirtysomething life back in the 1980s , wrote that she started using Botox for her frown lines in her mid-50s because she did n't want to look cross when she was n't . " And it 's addictive , " she told me with a laugh when I interviewed her about the book . This is where the Botox-as-sex metaphor comes in . Once you get a taste of it , it 's hard not to want a repeat , er , injection . <p> It is the treatment of depression through Botox , though , that is as new as a baby 's skin . In The Face of Emotion : How Botox Affects Our Moodsand Relationships , released two weeks ago , Eric Finzi , a dermatological surgeon , writes of the link between facial expressions and emotions . His theories and anecdotal evidence have recently been corroborated by thorough medical studies . ( Incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ) above , which he heard from one of his patients . ) <p> It 's not simply that a Botox injection to the face can make you feel happier because you look better . <p> That 's the assumption many make , Finzi acknowledges in an interview from Chevy Chase , Md. , where he lives and works . And he does n't dispute that looking good makes you feel good -- that 's his business after all . <p> Rather , Finzi 's work centres around the new and controversial idea that our facial expressions not only reflect our emotions , but also cause them . It 's a " facial feedback theory of emotion " that he describes as a continuous looping of signals or pathways between muscles and the brain . Basically , the more you frown , the more the brain experiences negative messaging . So when Botox inhibits the frown muscle , " that electrical circuit is clamped off , " Finzi explains over the phone . <p> In 2003 , he started a clinical trial to test his hypothesis that Botox inhibition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific theories from the 19th century , including Charles Darwin 's The Expression of the Emotions in Manand Animals , in which the celebrated scientist wrote : " The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it . On the other hand , the repression , as far as this is possible , of all outward signs softens our emotions . " <p> Finally , Finzi realized that he had a way to test ancient hypotheses with a modern tool : Botox . <p> His small studies also piqued the interest of Axel Wollmer , a psychiatrist at the University of Basel in Switzerland . Last year , results of his randomized controlled study on the effects of Botox on depression were published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research , showing significant statistical results . The study investigated whether patients who suffered from clinical depression and had not responded to antidepressant medications could be helped with Botox injections in their frown lines . <p> Participants in the treatment group were given a single dose of Botox ( five injections ) between and just above their eyebrows . An equal-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botox , symptoms of depression decreased 47 per cent after six weeks and lasted through the 16-week study period . In the placebo group , there was a nine per cent reduction in symptoms . Wollmer concluded that Botox " interrupts feedback from the facial musculature to the brain , which may be involved in the development and maintenance of negative emotion . " <p> What has hindered investigations into Botox and depression is the stigma it carries as merely a tool for the vain even though its uses for medical conditions such as cerebral palsy , Parkinson 's disease and migraines are well known , Finzi says . <p> " Do n't blame the molecule ! " he implores with a laugh . " Do n't attach whatever feelings you have about cosmetic procedures to its potential usefulness for other things . I would predict that , by the end of 2013 , there will be not only one but three randomized , controlled , double-blind tests that will have been completed . <p> And when all three are published , that will be very powerful stuff . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceutical companies . <p> Depression , of course , is a serious problem . And anything that can help alleviate it is significant . But I ca n't help but think that this news would provide the perfect excuse for indulging in Botox from here on in . " It 's not for my vanity , darling , " you could say at swishy soirees as your friends notice your newly unfurrowed brow .
