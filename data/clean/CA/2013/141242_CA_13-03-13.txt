New athletics plans include competitive clubs , national focus and outreach  UBC 's new plan for athletics will debut a competitive club category that could bump some varsity teams down in status .  The university is testing a new structure for competitive sports that would focus on national-level athletes , varsity competition and a new category of athletic club . This category would accommodate some of the non-varsity teams that currently operate without funding or facility support .  The new model is based on Canada Sport For Life 's work on creating a pathway for people to stay active from childhood to old age , according to UBC VP Students Louise Cowin .  " We tried to map on various components of what we do to fit within this structure , " she said . " What we want for all students and faculty and staff is to think about engaged individuals in terms of their physical , mental , emotional and social self . "  Under the plan , a UBC " sports club " would admit students only , carry support , as well as access to athletics facilities in non-peak times . Cowin said any competitive team could be eligible for " sports club " status -- the Wrestling Club , Sailing Club and Quidditch Club would all be in the running .  " Say there was a UBC badminton club , which does n't exist right now , that wanted to get a start at UBC . Then they would have access to the REC centre in morning or early afternoon time , " she said . " They would be expected to organize their class schedules to make that possible ... and if that did n't work , they could still get access during prime time , but they would have to pay . "  Criteria for what separates a varsity team from a competitive club would be set by the new director of the athletics department . External search consultants Odgers Berndtson are conducting the hiring for the position , and looking to bring in a director by early summer .  The director 's first task will be to review varsity sports -- which exclude some sports that receive the " privilege " of varsity status . Some non-varsity clubs have charged that the process to become a varsity team lacks transparency , a criticism upheld by a 2012 external review of UBC 's athletics department .  " Those criteria will be clear , and we 'll have a process , which we do n't have right now in terms of how decisions are made , " Cowin said . " It is possible that some sports that are currently varsity now might not be when we apply some yet-to-be-established criteria to those . "  Other types of competitive clubs could include clubs open to staff , faculty and university residents or organized youth academies . Cowin said that UBC 's ultimate frisbee club could fit in the open category . For youth opportunities , Cowin cited the students at University Hill Secondary , which was recently awarded a sports academy status that allows it to allocate time during the day to training , nutrition and sports psychology education . Cowin said UBC academies could give the university a leg up in recruiting look to form more partnerships with elite national programs . UBC has one such partnership with Swimming Canada , which results in non-student Olympians swimming alongside varsity athletes . She hopes to see sports institutes relocate to campus in order to bring more researchers and expand coaching training in UBC 's kinesiology department .  The other major change concerns recreation . UBC REC , which is currently run by Athletics , could find itself working under the umbrella of Student Development , the department that runs things like Imagine Day and the Centre for Student Involvement and Careers . Cowin said the university is looking for new recreational programming that could involve students who do n't visit REC facilities .  " Obviously there has to be a deep collaboration and connection , " Cowin said . " There 's a lot of devil in this detail that we have n't even begun to work through yet . It 's just a conceptual model at this time , but we need to get into that nitty-gritty work . "
