Provincial barriers hamper the flow of domestic wine

<p> It is the law that was supposed to free the grapes , ending a prohibition-era federal ban on individual purchases of wine across provincial borders . <p> It has n't quite worked out that way . <p> A year after the passage of Bill C-311 , the vast majority of Canadians still ca n't buy wine directly from an out-of-province winery , unless they haul it back themselves . <p> That 's because just two provinces -- British Columbia and Manitoba -- have so far authorized interprovincial Internet and phone sales to individuals since the law was passed . <p> Most notably , Ontario , Alberta and Quebec continue to jealously guard the revenues that flow through their own liquor distribution systems -- the latest example of internal trade barriers that persist in spite of concerted efforts to remove them . <p> " It just seems so ludicrous to me that we make a homegrown product . It 's local . It 's Canadian . It supports farming . It 's small business , " lamented Sandra Oldfield , chief executive and wine maker at Tinhorn Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of things we should be supporting in Canada . " <p> The small winery , located at the southern end of the Okanagan Valley near Osoyoos , B.C. , still ca n't sell its wine online or by phone to Canadians who want its product , except in Manitoba and B.C. <p> " I do n't think the intent or the spirit of C-311 has been followed by the provinces , so that 's frustrating for me , " Ms. Oldfield said . <p> Other wineries are choosing to turn a blind eye to lingering provincial restrictions , taking their cue instead from the federal government . <p> " I sell directly to consumers in Ontario right now , and I 'm not apologizing for it , " said John Skinner , proprietor of Painted Rock Estate Winery of Penticton , B.C. <p> Mr. Skinner said his growing direct sales in Ontario represent a tiny slice of the massive wine market , but are nonetheless crucial to making his small business " viable . " <p> Speaking at an event at another B.C. winery last week , federal Industry Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ontario , Alberta and other provinces . <p> " The elephants in the room are Ontario and Alberta , " agreed Beth McMahon , vice-president of government and public affairs for the Canadian Vintners Association , the lobby group for Canadian wineries . <p> " They see it as a threat to their liquor retail systems . They do n't want to see people go online or join a wine club and get wine shipped to them , and step around their own marketing systems . " <p> Industry sources said the provinces also worry that allowing Internet sales could open a back door for the sale of foreign wines directly to consumers . <p> But the amendment did n't touch the provinces ' right to to regulate the possession , movement and sale of wine . The Canada Revenue Agency points out on its website that " supporting provincial legislative or regulatory changes are also required to permit individuals to move wine interprovincially or to place orders with wineries by telephone or over the Internet . " <p> The Liquor Control Board of Ontario , which has a monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct is unnecessary because consumers can buy " any wine " not sold in its stores through the LCBO 's private ordering program . <p> But wineries say that 's not viable because of steep markups charged by the LCBO . Mr. Skinner of Painted Rock said he would have to sell his wine for nearly $100 a bottle , compared to his normal $55 list price . <p> So while the LCBO may say any Canadian wine is available , the reality is that most small wineries ca n't make money and so do n't sell that way , Mr. Skinner said . <p> Another anomaly is that Ontario allows its own residents to buy directly from Ontario wineries , but yet balks at interprovincial sales . <p> " It really is absurd , " said Ms. McMahon of the Canadian Vintners Association . <p> The provinces ' fear of Internet sales is misguided , she added . The U.S. experience , where 40 states now permit it , has shown that it expands the overall market , but grabs just 1 per cent of total sales . <p> Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian wine culture , " not doing an end run around provincial liquor boards . <p> " With wine , it 's all about the connections you make with people , " she said . " It 's really hard to do if you ca n't ship to them . " <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .
