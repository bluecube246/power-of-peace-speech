An aging population: our senior moment

a century ago , children outnumbered the elderly by as much as 10 to one in most european countries . today , there are as many people over the age of 65 as there are under the age of 16 . in britain , roughly one in six people is 65 or older , compared to one in eight americans , and one in four japanese .  this shift has been powered by declining birth and infant-mortality rates in the first half of the 20th century , together with rising life expectancy in recent decades . whatever the causes , many are concerned that , in the coming decades , rapidly aging populations will increasingly strain health , welfare and social-insurance systems , putting unsustainable pressure on public budgets .  but , while such fears are not entirely unfounded , discussions about population aging tend to exaggerate the trend 's scale , speed , and impact , owing to a fundamental misperception about how populations grow older . unlike people , populations do not follow the life cycle of birth , aging and death . , age becomes an unreliable way to measure a population 's productivity as lifespans increase .  age has two components : the number of years a person has lived ( which is easy to measure for individuals and populations ) and the number of years a person has left to live ( which is unknown for individuals , but possible to predict for populations ) . as mortality declines , remaining life expectancy ( rle ) increases for people of all ages . this distinction is crucial , because many behaviours and attitudes ( including those that are health-related ) may be linked more strongly to remaining life expectancy than to age .  the standard indicator of population aging is the old-age dependency ratio ( oadr ) , which divides the number of people who have reached the state pension age by the number of working-age adults . but this approach fails to distinguish between being of working age and actually working , while classifying all people above the statutory pension age as " dependants . "  in fact , social and economic shifts have broken the link number of years in education , while many older workers retire early , implying that they have sufficient personal savings . in the u.k. , the 9.5-million working-age dependants ( those who are not in paid employment ) outnumber those who are above the state pension age and do not work .  moreover , the old-age dependency ratio disregards how , over time , rising life expectancies effectively make people of the same chronological age younger . for example , in 1950 , a 65-year-old british woman had an average life expectancy of 14 years ; today , she can expect to live another 21 years .  a better measure of population aging 's impact is the real elderly dependency ratio ( redr ) , which divides the total number of people with a remaining life expectancy of 15 years or less by the number of people actually in employment , regardless of their age . this measure accounts for the real impact of changes in mortality , by allowing the " old age " boundary to shift as advances in health prolong people 's productive lifespans .  risen in advanced countries , the real elderly dependency ratio has declined . it has , however , stabilized and is likely to increase gradually over the next couple of decades .  immigration has played an important role in depressing many countries ' real elderly dependency ratio by raising employment rates . increased labour-force participation among women -- who spend a significantly higher share of their lives in paid employment than they did 50 years ago , when most women withdrew from it after marriage or childbirth -- has also helped to lower redrs . of course , failure to support these trends has the opposite effect . japan -- where opposition to immigration and failure to embrace gender equality have led to a rapidly rising real elderly dependency ratio -- is a case in point .  in short , the redr tells a very different story from the oadr , with at least three important policy implications . first , population aging is no excuse for trimming the welfare state or treating pension arrangements as unsustainable . after all , the phenomenon has been under way for more social and economic impact has been declining in recent decades .  moreover , the redr underscores that rising demand for health care and social services is not a function of having a larger share of people above a specific age . factors such as progress in medical knowledge and technology and the increasing complexity of age-related comorbid conditions are far more relevant .  in fact , while age-specific disability rates seem to be falling , recent generations have a worse risk-factor profile than older ones , owing to trends such as rising obesity rates . the capacity of health-care systems to cope with increasing longevity will therefore depend on the changing relationship between morbidity and remaining life expectancy .  the third implication concerns higher education . elderly people with university degrees ( a small minority of their generation ) enjoy a substantial longevity advantage . if the life-enhancing effect of higher education persists , population aging can be expected to accelerate further , as the younger , larger and more highly educated generations grow older .  preparing for and coping with changing demographics requires a more nuanced , the right indicator -- the real elderly dependency ratio -- is essential .  john macinnes is a professor of sociology and jeroen spijker is senior research fellow at the school of social and political science , university of edinburgh .
