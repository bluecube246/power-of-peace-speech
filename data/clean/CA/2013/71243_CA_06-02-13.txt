' incompatible with life ' : mother 's account of her difficult decision to request a late-term abortion sheds light on ' live-born ' debate  one mother 's account of her difficult decision to request a rare , late-term abortion  twenty-one weeks into her second pregnancy , when the fetus was diagnosed with a rare bone disease , carol determined she had two options : miscarry the baby naturally and deliver a child with a shattered skeleton that would live for a matter of seconds or request a rare late-term abortion .  " i found out when i was five months pregnant , and ... by the time you 're five months pregnant you 're all in , " said carol , not her real name . " there 's no great outcome in these situations . "  babies without lungs , kidneys , spines , bones or brains : these are the rare " incompatible with life " conditions that clinicians say prompt most , if not all , of canada 's contentious " live born " abortions . according to statistics and 2009 .  but while three mps drafted a jan. 23 letter to the rcmp citing these " live born " abortions as evidence of premeditated " homicide " in canadian hospitals , clinicians and veterans of the procedure maintain that in canada , the only fetuses terminated in late-stage abortions are those whose fates are already sealed .  carol 's fetus was killed by the procedure , but it was virtually identical to those that result in live births .  " i want people to understand what these women have been through before they start accusing the doctors who helped them of being murderers , " said carol .  in 2010 , 537 canadian women underwent abortions after 21 weeks of pregnancy , not including quebec . according to wendy norman , a clinical professor at the university of british columbia , " almost everyone " in those cases " has some different anomaly . "  some have fetal anencephaly , a condition in which the fetus fails to develop a brain .  others fail to develop kidneys , a condition known as potter  many times , said dr. norman , the specific defect is so rare that it does not even have a proper medical name .  after an ultrasound at 21 weeks , carol 's fetus was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta , a genetic disorder that results in severe bone fragility .  less severe versions of the condition are survivable , although they result in physical deformities into adulthood . carol 's fetus , however , had one of the most extreme cases .  if the baby was naturally stillborn , said carol , she would have needed to select a name , learn the child 's gender and make funeral arrangements .  carol requested a late-stage abortion , adding that the procedure was never broached by medical staff , and even finding a physician qualified to perform it was a challenge .  " they 're not offering these things up . it was n't even presented as an option , " she said .  if anything , she said , hospital staff made sure to explain why some women will carry a known stillborn to birth .  blogs and online pregnancy forums abound with testimonials from women who carried their children to term with full knowledge that they would not live more than a matter of minutes .  i savored every kick and turn she made inside my growing belly  " i savored every kick and turn she made inside my growing belly , " wrote one woman of her decision to carry a fetus with fetal anencephaly to term .  wrote another woman whose fetus was diagnosed with potter 's syndrome , " i chose to carry to term and made it to 37 1/2 weeks when we had a c-section ... he lived just under three hours , the happiest and saddest hours of my life . "  speaking to the post in november , dr. douglas black , president of the society of obstetricians and gynaecologists , speculated that similar sentiments may underlie the 491 " live-born " abortions between 2000 and 2009 .  as hospitals will routinely administer a lethal injection to a fetus prior to a later-stage abortion , dr. black guessed that any aborted due to the " private choice " of a mother .  such fetuses are " subsequently allowed to pass away , depending on what the circumstances are , sometimes in their mom 's arms , " he said .  for carol , there were physical risks of carrying the fetus to term over another four months , but she said it was also a psychological decision .  " the idea of having the pain of childbirth compounded by the really emotional trauma of losing a child , it was a lot to take on . ... i do n't think i would have been able to think about having more babies subsequently , " she said . she has since given birth to a second child in a complications-free pregnancy .
