The Our Lady of Lourdes Shrine , located 55 km southwest of Prince Albert , has been a pilgrimage site for Roman Catholics for 134 years , drawing visitors every summer starting on the May long weekend and ending Sept. 8 , when the Nativity of Mary is celebrated .  The Shrine , which began its history as a M ? t is settlement and Catholic mission , has a rich history that is interwoven with the North West Rebellion . Duck Lake , where the eponymous battle took place , is just to the southwest .  " It goes back years , " said Gerry Ostiguy , the tour guide .  " A lot of elderly people come who remember coming here in a horse and buggy . "  The amount of people that come varies year to year , but on a good day six or seven thousand people will walk through the grounds , Ostiguy said .  Many bring tents or campers to stay overnight .  The shrine receives visitors from all over the world and from every how they find us in the middle of the bush in Saskatchewan . "  " I 've had people from Austria , Germany , Poland , France ( and ) all over the States .  " Just the other day I two gentlemen from Mexico . "  Ostiguy seemed surprised that so many people come to visit .  " It 's a very rustic shrine , " she said . " We 've got animals , squirrels and bears -- you name it .  " But somehow , people like coming here . It 's very peaceful and quiet . "  Around the Grotto , where rows of pews looked on to a display of Mary , birdcalls echoed through the woods .  " It 's a peaceful place to sit and say the rosary at night , " Ostiguy said .  A grassy trail leads through the forest nearby , where the Stations of the Cross appear amidst the poplar trees .  " We tell people to make noise when they walk through ( because of the bears ) , " see at the Shrine is a statue that was erected in 1885 by a man named Charles Nolin after his wife recovered from a serious illness . According to the plaque beside the statue , Mrs. Nolin was cured by water that Brother Piquet , one of the Shrine 's founders , had brought from Lourdes , France .  At the top of a hill a graveyard overlooks the country where Riel led his rebellion . A M ? t is flag flies over the gravestones . Three graves without names bear the inscription , ' Died 1885 Riel Rebellion . '  The last big day of the summer will be September 8 , which marks the closing of the Shrine for winter . Visitors are asked to bring a long-stemmed rose .
