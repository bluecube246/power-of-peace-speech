<p> Much like the Keystone XL debacle in Washington , the EU 's proposed Fuel Quality Directive illustrates the hypocrisy of climate change politics -- tough to sell at home , the pain of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is pushed abroad to feign the appearance of progress . Continue reading . <p> Industry Canada officials are now vetting deals that do n't require approval under the nation 's foreign-takeover law , according to two people who have advised on transactions involving state-owned companies . Even foreign investors not usually deemed state owned are being asked to prove they are n't controlled or influenced by government , including whether the state has the power to appoint directors , said another person familiar with the process . The people asked not to be identified as the details are n't public . <p> The federal government is also probing more proposed acquisitions involving state-owned firms to see if they pose a threat to national security , said Julie Soloway , a partner at Blake , Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP in Toronto . <p> " They are definitely digging deeper on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 12 . <p> Mergers and acquisitions in the oil sands fell this year to the lowest since 2004 , data compiled by Bloomberg show . Smaller developers including Athabasca Oil Corp . and BlackPearl Resources Inc. are lagging behind peers after the government introduced rules to block state-owned buyers from purchasing oil-sands companies . Athabasca fell 24 percent since the rules were made public on Dec. 7 , versus a 6.4% gain on the Standard &amp; Poor's/TSX Energy Index . <p> Additional Challenge <p> " You 've had companies that have taken a step back and looked at what they can do and what they ca n't do and I think a few transactions that were going to proceed have not proceeded because of this , " said George Gosbee , chief executive officer of AltaCorp Capital Inc. , a Calgary-based investment bank . <p> The additional government scrutiny adds to challenges affecting Canadian energy stocks , including a slower economy in China and pipeline shortages that have helped push Canadian heavy crude prices to US$31.20 a barrel below the U.S. benchmark . Spot prices for Western Canadian Select , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , versus US$102.32 for West Texas Intermediate , according to figures compiled by Bloomberg . <p> Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is examining whether the added scrutiny is contributing to a drop in investment by state-owned companies in a sector that depends on foreign cash , Jim Prentice , vice chairman of the bank and a former Canadian industry minister , said in Calgary . <p> ' Energy Superpower ' <p> " It behooves us to look at this and to assess what the causes are and to make sure that , as a country , we 're careful , " Prentice said in an interview on Sept. 18 . <p> Prime Minister Stephen Harper , who has called Canada an emerging " energy superpower , " is asserting control over the nation 's resources after about US$51-billion in investments by state-owned firms in the Canadian oil and gas industry over the last seven years , according to data compiled by Bloomberg . The nation 's oil sands in Alberta are the world 's third largest source of crude reserves and the starting point for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNOOC Ltd. ' s US$15.1-billion acquisition of Calgary producer Nexen Inc. , and the $5.2-billion purchase of Progress Energy Resources Corp . by Petroliam Nasional Bhd. , Malaysia 's state-owned energy company . At the same time , Harper said the government would permit further purchases of oil-sands businesses by state-owned enterprises only under " exceptional circumstances . " <p> The government , which already vets foreign takeovers above $344-million , also said it will " carefully monitor " deals involving state-owned enterprises in the world 's 11th-largest economy , and will " act to safeguard Canadian interests " when it appears that such acquisitions will " undermine the private sector orientation of an industry . " <p> The rules created a " perfect storm " to reduce deal activity in the oil sands , where stocks had already been dragged down by lower oil and gas prices , said Dan Cheng of Matco Financial Inc. , who helps manage $430-million from Calgary . <p> Canadian energy companies have underperformed U.S. peers by 27 percentage points on Standard &amp; Poor 's indexes during the past five years , according to figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US$5.3-billion Keystone XL pipeline is in its sixth year of U.S. review , a delay that has led to pipeline bottlenecks . Economic growth in China , the world 's largest energy consumer , is projected by analysts to rise 7.6% in 2013 , the lowest annual increase since a 7.6% expansion in 1999 , data compiled by Bloomberg show . <p> Voting Rights <p> Now Industry Canada is reviewing transactions involving state-owned enterprises that fall below the $344-million threshold that triggers an automatic review , according to two people familiar with discussions with the department . <p> All foreign investors are also now being asked a set of questions on state control , including whether a state owns a third or more of the investor 's voting rights and whether a government has the power to appoint managers and members of the company 's board , said one of the people familiar with the talks . <p> Industry Minister James Moore said foreign takeovers have been " elevated to a new degree of sensitivity " since the Nexen and Progress decisions . <p> " This is something that has greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that any decision is given the weight and consideration that it 's due and the department is allocating the resources and talent to these kinds of decisions , " Moore said in an interview last month at his Ottawa office . <p> Pipeline Venture <p> TransCanada and a unit of PetroChina Co. said in October they would work together on a $3-billion oil pipeline through Alberta . After Harper announced the new foreign-takeover rules in December , the government asked the companies to halt the project while it examined the deal on national security grounds , said a person familiar with the issue . <p> The review surprised company officials , because the government initially welcomed the project , said the person , who asked not to be identified because the discussions are n't public . The project did n't involve oil-sands production and was a joint venture , not a takeover . <p> The pipeline is still on schedule , said Davis Sheremata , a TransCanada spokesman , declining to comment on discussions with governments . Mao Zefeng , a spokesman in Beijing for PetroChina , the publicly traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone the company has no comment on the project . <p> Athabasca , BlackPearl <p> Industry Canada 's media relations office did n't immediately respond to a request for comment on the department 's scrutiny of transactions involving state-owned enterprises , including the deal between TransCanada and PetroChina . <p> The $751-million purchase by Exxon Mobil Corp . and Imperial Oil Ltd. of ConocoPhillips ' Clyden property in Alberta marked the first " significant " oil-sands transaction in 2013 , according to a report this month by Peters &amp; Co. , a Calgary investment adviser . The deal activity compares with $16.1-billion in mergers and acquisitions involving the oil sands last year , including the Nexen takeover . <p> Investors betting on an Athabasca Oil takeover have left the stock , Andre De Leebeeck , a company spokesman , said in a phone interview . <p> BlackPearl has had similar share price declines to Athabasca , falling 35% since the rules were announced . John Festival , chief executive officer of the company , did n't return a phone message seeking comment . <p> Seeking Clarity <p> Athabasca , which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been seeking clarity for months on how the government defines control by a state-owned company to speed talks on potential new partnerships , De Leebeeck said . <p> Canada 's new foreign-takeover policies were more stringent than expected and have resulted in lower investment from state- owned companies even outside the oil sands , said John Brussa , vice chairman at Burnet , Duckworth &amp; Palmer LLP in Calgary . <p> " That policy came a bit out of left field , " Brussa said . " It 's made the SOEs quite reticent to stick their toe in the water , generally , " he said , referring to state-owned enterprises .
