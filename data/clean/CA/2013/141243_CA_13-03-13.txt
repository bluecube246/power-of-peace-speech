how to curb bureaucratic empire-building : goar  donald savoie is making politicians and bureaucrats squirm with his latest book , whatever happened to the music teacher ? it challenges the widely held belief that government should be run like a business .  the young acadian came to ottawa with impeccable credentials . he was fluently bilingual , had a doctorate from oxford university and a passion for public service .  there was one problem . donald savoie did n't seem to understand the bureaucratic culture . he went to his deputy minister early in his career and said he felt there were too many people in the department for the amount of work required .  " the reaction was swift , " savoie recounts . " he proceeded to tell me that i was showing a disturbing level of disloyalty to the department . he pointed out that if i truly felt this way , i should seriously think about leaving . "  that might be one of the dumbest pieces of advice ever doled out by a senior government official . brunswick roots and became a professor at the universit ? de moncton where he wrote more than 40 books about politics , public administration and the decline of democracy . he is now an internationally respected scholar with seven honorary degrees and an armload of awards , medals and prizes . he has advised prime ministers , premiers , corporate leaders , the un and the world bank .  the government of canada could have had all that talent -- but drove savoie out .  the moncton author , now in his 66th year , is still making politicians and bureaucrats squirm . his latest book , whatever happened to the music teacher ? , challenges the widely held belief that government should be run like a business .  ( the title -- likely to puzzle non-maritimers -- came from a conversation savoie had with a leading canadian businessman . the nova scotia-born magnate had grown up in a small village where the music teacher , a provincial employee , worked alongside the two-person bureau of the department of natural resources . " today we are told we , " the businessman said . " however , the department of natural resources is now housed in two fine buildings employing 150 people . " )  to savoie , this anecdote encapsulated what has happened to canada 's public service over the past 30 years : front-line workers have been sacrificed to make way for offices full of paper-pushers , managers , supervisors and evaluators . " it is ill-conceived , costly and misguided . "  the bottom-line doctrine took hold under prime minister brian mulroney , who decided the public sector should operate with the same market discipline as private enterprise . his four successors have adhered to it slavishly .  it has never worked and it never will , savoie says .  the first problem is that the public sector is not in the business of making money . in the absence of profit-loss statement , it has no way of measuring how well it is doing . so it fabricates yardsticks and backs them up with reams of reports showing how efficient , effective and indispensable it is .  the second problem " the process by which industry gets rid of outmoded products and develops new ones . bureaucrats do n't have the power to pull the plug and politicians seldom do it for fear of offending vested interests . " the problem is not that government is spending more on new things , but that it spends massively on old things . "  the closest the public sector comes to creative destruction is when the prime minister takes a good whack at the bureaucracy as stephen harper is doing now , savoie says . but the wrong people get cut and the numbers soon creep back up . when mulroney took office , 70 per cent of federal employees worked in the field delivering services : settling new immigrants , assisting laid-off workers , running airports , preventing pollution and making sure canadians got their pensions , passports and baby bonuses . today the proportion is 57 per cent -- and shrinking .  the remedy is obvious , savoie says with the same clear-sightedness that once scandalized his boss . figure out what a government department is supposed to do  ottawa still wo n't like it , but this time it comes from a man with a global reputation for smart public policy at a time when taxpayers want to know why they pay so many bureaucrats to provide such poor service .
