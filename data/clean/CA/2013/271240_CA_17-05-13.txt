<h> Canada needs a better stock exchange , says Ned Goodman <p> What follows is an excerpt from a speech by Ned Goodman , President and CEO of Toronto-based Dundee Corp . ( TSX : T.DC.A , Stock Forum ) . He was speaking to the Association for Mineral Exploration B.C. in Vancouver , May 10 , 2013 . <p> I am part of a brokerage firm that depends on the Toronto Stock Exchange . <p> We are at a point now where there is an impediment to economic growth , job creation , innovation , and business formation . <p> And everybody has forgotten about why a stock exchange was put in place . <p> A stock exchange was put in place to allow junior companies , individuals to come up with new ideas , be innovative and be able to raise money . <p> All we do now when we do that is we raise money for the legal profession . I do n't think we should be doing that . I think we should be raising money to spend it in the ground . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Toronto Stock Exchange ( we call it the TSX Venture Exchange ) , most of the people in Toronto caught a disease called Bre-X , and they are still looking for the next Bre-X . <p> They do n't know what to do about it , so they put in all kinds of rules . <p> ( Investors in Bre-X Minerals lost about $3 billion in 1997 when its so-called Busang gold find in Indonesia was found to be a scam ) . <p> I was quoted on something called Sino-Forest Corp . ( TSX : T.TRE , Stock Forum ) , where the regulators took a company , totally wiped it out , shareholders got zero , billions of dollars were lost . <p> ( Investors in Sino-Forest were left stranded when the Ontario Securities Commission suspended trading in the Chinese-Canadian timber firm in August , 2011 . This was after a short seller alleged that the company was a " Ponzi scheme , " causing the shares to collapse ) . <p> The company is being taken over by the debt holders because the Ontario Securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of the underwriting of Sino-Forest . So I had a senior person at the office of the Ontario Securities Commission every day almost for months . <p> In the end , they told us that we did all our due diligence correctly , no problems . They congratulated us . We were told that they were proud of us that we had all the right stuff . It made me feel good . <p> Except that billions of dollars of the equity was wiped out . <p> It was wiped out because the Globe and Mail ( newspaper ) came back from a visit and they said we could n't find any place where Sino-Forest owned the land where the supposed trees were . Well of course not . In China , nobody owns the land . It is the state that owns the land . You rent the land from the state . <p> On that basis they put the company out of business . <p> The point that I made at that time , I was asked do we need more regulation ? <p> And I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only do we need better regulation . We need a better stock exchange and better things of that nature .
