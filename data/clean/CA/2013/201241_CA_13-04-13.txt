<h> Hunger pains <h> Jets starving for a chance to dine at the playoff party <p> High up on Bryan Little 's cheekbone -- left side , near his eye -- are the visible remnants of a fairly recent gash . And now that painful reminder has a couple of partners : an ugly cut across the bridge of his nose and a scrape on his upper lip that came Thursday night after a collision with Florida 's Erik Gudbranson and the end boards . <p> This is the face many have seen before -- the face of sacrifice , of commitment , of the price to be paid . And if this were a month from now and Little and his Winnipeg Jets teammates were to find themselves in the postseason , it would be held up and glorified as the visage of a player battling in the Stanley Cup playoffs . <p> JOE BRYKSA / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS <p> Bryan Little has n't played in a post-season game since his rookie season as a pro -- five years ago . Purchase Photo Print <p> AP <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only watch as they were swept by the Rangers from the 2007 post-season . <p> Evander Kane <p> Right now , that 's still a big ' if ' , what with the Jets still staring up at eight teams in the Eastern Conference standings . But it 's also not being melodramatic to suggest it 's the hunger to get to the postseason that is driving this club right now through a three-game win streak . <p> Yes , there has been a hint of desperation in the collective Jets voices of late and a real evidence of it in their game . <p> And on their faces . <p> " The last time I played in a playoff game was with the Chicago Wolves in my first year as a pro , " said Little . " That was five years ago . <p> " Anyone that 's never played in a playoff game is pretty hungry to get in there . I know there 's a couple of us guys who have been with Atlanta for a long time who have n't played in a playoff game ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . <p> " That 's my dream . " <p> He 's not alone . Of the 28 players now with the Jets -- not including rookie Jacob Trouba , who has yet to suit up -- 16 , or more than half , have never played in a single Stanley Cup playoff game . <p> " I 'm just really focussed on these last games to try and change that and make ( playing in the playoffs ) a reality , " said Kane . " I really want to play in the playoffs . I do n't want to go home early this year . It 's already been a shortened season and it would be extremely disappointing if we did n't get the job done . <p> " If we get hot and we win the majority of these last games it 's going to give us a good shot going into the playoffs . Once you get in the playoffs anything can happen . It 's cliche , but it 's true . For us it 's an opportunity win and that 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity you have no chance . " <p> What the Jets hope to do in the next six games is twofold : 1 . Lock up a playoff spot for the franchise for first time since 2006-07 and 2 . Begin writing their own postseason history , separate from the Atlanta Thrashers crew that was swept out of the first round by the New York Rangers in its ' one and only trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs . <p> " In the past ... I do n't know how it was last year but usually in Atlanta , this team has been way out of the playoff position this time of year , " said Olli Jokinen , a veteran of 1,084 NHL games , but only six in the playoffs . " It 's a great experience for the players and a great challenge at the same time . <p> " We do n't want to be here in two weeks and say that ' Oh , we were close . ' That 's not the mindset we have . We have these couple of days off to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready in the playoffs once we get there . <p> " This is the exciting time of the year . We 're happy that we 're in the position that we can control where we 're going . Obvioisly it would be nice to have 10 more points and breathe a little easier but at the same time this team has n't been in the playoffs for a while and for a lot of the players this is a great situation . " <p> Great , only if they can finish the deal here . Maybe that , in part , explains why Little returned in the third period after taking the hit from Gudbranson that opened up his nose and left some wondering if he had busted it . <p> Just for the record , the Jets were winning 6-2 when Little exited . <p> " You play every year to play for the Stanley Cup , " said Little . " That 's why you play the regular season . Most kids that grow up in Canada , that 's their dream : to play in the NHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance at the second , you 've got to make it to the playoffs and I can tell you it 's been tough not being there year after year . <p> " Plus , I 'd love to see what it would be like here if there was a playoff game , " Little added , with a sly grin . " I think it would be crazy . " <h> Related Items <h> Articles <p> You can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com . You can also agree or disagree with other comments .
