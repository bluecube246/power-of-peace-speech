one fated knight bags it chic  these days , most indie designers start off by selling their wares through etsy or craft fairs . then , maybe after a year or so , their label gains enough traction to score a deal with a local retailer -- or two , if they 're lucky .  but jennifer yau is not most indie designers . this stylish , young firecracker knows how to get products onto shelves . she served 10 years in the wholesale trenches , working for a global denim brand . so by the time she launched her own handbag label , one fated knight , it took her less than a season to get her gorgeous leather goods into 30 stores across canada , including plenty ( various locations ) , fine finds ( 1014 mainland street ) , and riot clothing ( 1395 commercial drive ) .  it 's an impressive feat , and one that 's been a long time coming . as the vancouver native recalls , even though she 'd worked her way up to a fairly she had been itching to strike out on her own for quite a while .  " after about two years of repping for the same brand , i quickly realized that really was n't my passion after all , " says yau , who recently sat down with the straight at an east van caf ? . " even when i was living in new york , i was still working for the same brand -- although it was a change of scenery . but it was the same job . sure , it was a better position and i had more responsibility , but ultimately i lost my creative edge .  " it was like 50 shades of blue , " she continues with a laugh before mocking her sales banter of yesteryear . " ' this one has three whiskers here -- so it 's a completely different jean ! do you want it skinny , straight , or boot cut ? ' "  of course , these days , there 's nothing rote or disingenuous about her sales pitch . she genuinely loves her product are beyond beautiful . the bishop ( $198 ) , for example , is a classic woven bucket tote that looks like it could come from any era and will only get better with age . the same goes for the archbishop ( $168 ) , a chic , tasselled hobo that , like most of her designs , comes in cognac or black . the most hipster bag in this collection is the eggshell count ( $228 ) , a leather backpack with brown suede trim and antique-finished hardware .  in addition to creating timeless bags , one of yau 's main goals with one fated knight was to make her pieces relatively affordable without resorting to pleather . even though designers like marc jacobs are a major source of inspiration for yau , at this point in her life she ca n't justify those kinds of prices .  " i know that high-end is very coveted and that it exudes luxury and whatnot , " the designer says . " but i thought that i can still do that within an attainable price point because with the want to buy stuff , but they 're not buying $1,500 bags -- well , the average person is n't , anyway . i mean , there 's definitely a market for the chanels , the lvs louis vuittons , and all that . but i 'm not going after that market because that 's not someone i relate to yet -- maybe in 10 years , when i 'm making more dough , but right now it 's like , ' rent or an lv bag ?
