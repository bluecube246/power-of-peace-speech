Farm Credit: A Crown full of risks

north america 's population in the 19th century spread from east to west , driven in the main by farming . and where farmers planted themselves , so grew a demand for farm credit , and eastern bankers followed them .  drought and crop failure repeatedly parched farmers ' credit , and their bankers ' , and when fresh credit got tough to get , the farmers turned to government for help . here , farm economics and politics led to the 1920s ' canadian farm loan board , created to offer mortgages to respond to a perceived lack of credit for western farmers .  the farm credit corporation replaced the board in 1959 , with a broader mandate that included consulting services for farmers . the former board operated mostly on a for-profit basis , but fcc 's lending rate was set at 5% , well below profitability , amounting to an interest rate subsidy to farmers . by the 1970s , as the corporation 's losses mounted , interest rates were set at " the cost of funds plus 1.25% . "  farm credit corporation act . the new act allowed fcc to finance farm-related enterprises , and bigger farms . it did not limit fccs activities to filling gaps left by the private sector . these steps -- the shift from for-profit to subsidized farm credit , and the expansion to areas where there was no clear market failure -- signaled departure from fcc 's original credit-gap mandate . changes in 2001 allowed fcc to offer more of financial and business management services , and widened fcc 's potential clientele to include more farm-related businesses , including those not farmer-owned . and fcc has seen tremendous growth : its share of farm debt grew from about 14% in 1992 to 29% by the end of 2011 .  fcc 's share of farm debt stands against that of all chartered banks , which hold 36% , and all credit unions , which hold another 16% . fcc has expanded its activities , enlarged its capital base to do so , and built market in a field where the private sector is historically competitive .  fcc 's success owes much to its government , and it borrows directly from the federal government on terms that reflect ottawa 's credit quality . it does not face the same regulatory capital requirements as other financial institutions , and pays no corporate income tax . and fcc 's loan offerings and terms are different from others ' . fcc loans tend to have long amortization periods , higher loan-to-value ratios , and the corporation stands at least as ready as others to lend against supply management ( dairy and poultry farm ) quotas and to offer interest-only loans . it finances farmers who sign ontario " green energy " supply contacts . other offerings seem likely to encourage debt and inflate farm asset values :  the capacity builder loan , to finance quota purchases or livestock , with an option to capitalize interest ( in turn , deeply investing fcc , and federal taxpayers , in maintaining the farm quota system ) .  none of these is inherently inappropriate , but they are risky , in much the same way that so-called subprime mortgage lending is risky . loans characterized by low down payments early accumulations of interest due , or involve balloon or variable future payments , have a higher default rate than more traditional loans .  now , lending under such risky conditions carries an interest rate premium . for small business lending , a typical risk premium might be 300 basis points above prime . of course , fcc does not charge such a premium and , unsurprisingly , its relatively risky loan books carry an impairment ratio that exceeds its competitors ' . and risks have been growing alongside farm indebtedness as a percent of net income ( see graph ) .  the implications are simple but serious : fcc competes with private-sector lenders in offering financing services to farmers and others ; its market share has been growing without a regulatory capital constraint ; and farm lending has grown relative to farm income , an indicator of rising risk in the sector . the increased financial risks also appear on the asset side of farms ' balance sheets . the values of farms and buildings , and farm quota values , have shown effervescent increases in recent years ' total assets ( see graph ) . and fcc 's lending has grown even faster than farm asset values .  of course , credit tends to drive asset prices , and increases tend to be followed by sharp revaluations . recent farm debt growth , coupled with fcc 's aggressive strategies , warrants closer examination by regulators and taxpayers . the potential impacts are not only related to fcc : its market pressure pushes private lenders to adjust their own lending standards , to remain competitive .  canadian regulators need to monitor the situation more closely . fcc , as is the case for the bdc and edc , is not formally subject to a prudential regulator . as a starting place , fcc should be brought under osfi supervision .  letters to the editor  please include your address and daytime telephone number . we give preference to letters that refer to a particular article by headline , author and date .  if your letter concerns articles in other sections of the national post , including business articles that appear in the a section , and other materials sent to the publisher and accepted for publication remains with the author , but the publisher and its licensees may freely reproduce them in print , electronic and other forms .
