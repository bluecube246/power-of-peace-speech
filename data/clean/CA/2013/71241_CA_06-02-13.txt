<h> James Fergusson : Up in the air , North of 60 <h> Up in the air , North of 60 <p> What follows is the third of five excerpts from a newly released e-book , The Canadian Forces in 2025 : Problems and Prospects . The publication was commissioned by the Strategic Studies Working Group -- a partnership between the Canadian International Council and the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute . In today 's installment , James Fergusson looks at our Air-Force presence in the Arctic . <p> The federal government has tasked the Canadian Forces with monitoring , controlling and enforcing Canadian laws and regulations over its Arctic territory and adjacent waters . In so doing , the government , through its 2008 Canada First Defence Strategy and National Shipbuilding Strategy , has focused particular attention on the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) . <p> The RCN and Coast Guard will play a major role in enforcing national laws and regulations on fishing , the environment , shipping and smuggling . However , the major burden will fall on the Royal Canadian Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today , the RCAF is a " southern , " overseas Air Force that goes North only when necessary . Only four Twin Otter aircraft are permanently deployed to the North , at Yellowknife , with Joint Task Force North Headquarters . They undertake a variety of missions , including search and rescue ( SAR ) . <p> A small number of CF-18 fighters , deployed at Cold Lake and Bagotville , and assigned to NORAD , are dedicated to the air-sovereignty mission . Their primary use continues to be to intercept Russian bombers on training missions as they approach Canadian air space . Four forward operating locations ( FOLs ) , co-located with civilian airports in Yellowknife , Inuvik , Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet were developed in the 1980s for the dispersal of CF-18s to the North . In addition , the Aurora surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft undertake regular Arctic patrols . <p> To monitor Canadian and North American air space in the North , the North Warning System ( NWS ) replaced NORAD 's Distant Early Warning radar line in the 1980s . It primarily consists of automated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwest Passage . Finally , the RCAF operates Canadian Forces Station Alert on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island . The station performs a signals intelligence function and supports SAR . <p> It is projected that over the next decade there will be an exponential increase in shipping and resource exploitation activity in the Arctic . If so , the RCAF will be required to monitor Canada 's Arctic on a daily basis . More activity also means an increase in search and rescue demands . As such , the RCAF will have no choice but to shift resources to the North on a permanent basis . <p> To meet this demand , the existing FOLs likely will become permanent bases for forward deployed surveillance and reconnaissance and SAR aircraft . The Aurora , or possibly future unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , will play a vital role in monitoring traffic over this expansive area . Though UAVs can be operated from bases in the south through satellite links , they will still need to be maintained at their bases in the North . <p> Being cued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide tracking of shipping and fishing vessels , the identification of targets of interest , and direction of RCN or Coast Guard vessels for interception purposes . Permanently deployed SAR aircraft and helicopters will be necessary to provide rapid response to accidents in the North . In addition , helicopters also will potentially provide a rapid response interception capability . <p> There is also a slight possibility that the CF-18 or its replacement will need to be permanently deployed to the North . However , the likelihood that significant military threats will emerge in the Arctic is very low , especially as a function of the harsh environment . <p> Finally , the North Warning System will likely be expanded northward as part of its future modernization , with all the attendant costs of building new sites . <p> Currently , the RCAF is developing a northern plan to meet future demand . Regardless of the details , the costs will be significant . Building and staffing permanent bases will be expensive , although some costs may be offset by other government departments and agencies in response to increased civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to acquire a dedicated Arctic aircraft : The current and planned inventory of multi-role aircraft will be able to meet this requirement . That will reduce some costs . However , aircraft and personnel deployed to the North on a permanent basis will impact the ability of the RCAF to meet its other demands . <p> Costs related to the retention and recruitment of personnel also will be significant . Canadians may have an emotional attachment to the North , but this does not necessarily mean that RCAF personnel and their families will look forward to being posted there for several years . <p> In order to meet these costs , the key issue for the RCAF is whether government will be willing to provide the necessary funding . If not , the RCAF will be strained to the breaking point , which will cascade throughout the organization as it confronts other significant investment demands on its equipment and personnel . <p> National Post <p> James Fergusson is a Research Fellow with the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute .
