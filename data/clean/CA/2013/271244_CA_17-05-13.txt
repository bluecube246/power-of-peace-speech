<h> Fishing is good , business is rough <p> Lobstermen talk about their work , their finances and public perception <p> Jensyn Doyle , Robert deYoung and Captain Brendan Doyle fish lobster off Bayfield , Antigonish County , on Tuesday after fishermen voted in Antigonish on Monday night to end their protest . <p> BAYFIELD -- Brendan Doyle has a few hundred square yards of bottom to call his own . <p> For nine years , every dollar he 's hauled aboard the Dethadol , Gaelic for " What 's goin ' on , " has gone to pay for his boat and licence . <p> On Tuesday , the Bayfield , Antigonish County , fisherman was back on the water . <p> " As much as fishing is a passion , it 's also a business , " said Doyle as he steamed toward his lobster traps at 5 a.m . <p> The fishing has been pretty good around most of northern Nova Scotia over recent years . <p> It 's the business that 's been rough . <p> After a winter of low landings around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to expect about $5 a pound for their catch when the Northumberland Strait season opened . When within a week of that season opening , catches dropped to $4 a pound for market-sized lobster and $3.75 for the smaller " canners , " a movement began . <p> The frustration bounced from boat to boat over marine radios on May 7 . <p> Word spread that in Prince Edward Island , boats were tying up in protest , even blockading fish plants . The following day , fishermen descended on Antigonish from across northern Nova Scotia to begin what would become their largest mass protest in living memory . <p> By May 9 , more than 1,000 boats from Pugwash to Cheticamp and down the Eastern Shore , were tied up in protest . Another 1,000 in Prince Edward Island and hundreds more in New Brunswick were all tied up . <p> " We need to get some answers , " Dan MacDougall , president of the Gulf Nova Scotia Bonafide Fishermen 's Association , told the second gathering of fishermen at a wharf in Caribou on May 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running their businesses is required by fishermen who operate enterprises capitalized at between $300,000 and $500,000 , with growing ongoing expenses for bait , fuel , maintenance and crew , their ultimate and repeated demand was for greater clarity in the industry . <p> At each meeting , the fishermen demanded an opening of the books throughout the supply chain to show where the money goes from the wharf to the plate . <p> That 'll be the job of a panel promised by the fisheries ministers of the three Maritime provinces last week . A promise that saw fishermen return to the water without an increase in catch prices . <p> So where does the money go ? <p> " We have eliminated the middleman and we 've still suffered significant losses for the past two years , " Osborne Burke , manager of Victoria Co-operative Fisheries Limited , said Thursday . <p> " Anybody who thinks there 's a fortune being made out there , I 'd like them to walk in my shoes . " <p> In 1957 , the fishermen of northern Cape Breton banded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co-operative Fisheries Limited expanded over the decades to become not only a buyer , but a processor and exporter , and after the decline of the groundfish fishery , turned most of its efforts to crab and lobster . Run by a volunteer board of fishermen , all its books are open and its members receive annual statements . <p> They 're also told , a rare occurrence in the industry , what they 'll get paid for their catch before the season opens . <p> This year , it 's $4 dollars a pound for market-sized lobster . <p> " We made it very clear that we 'll try at that price for the first couple of days , and if it 's not viable , we 'll have to adjust the price down , " said Burke . <p> " And realistically , that 's what 's going to happen . " <p> A thousand pounds of lobster at the wharf does n't end up a thousand pounds sold to the plate . <p> About half the lobster the co-op buys between Dingwall and Gabarus goes into the live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobsters have to be handled repeatedly as they 're sized and sorted and sorted again at the Neils Harbour fish plant , and there are losses all along the way because of mortality and weak lobsters . <p> The other half , the small and the imperfectly formed , that goes to processing only yields from 30-35 per cent of its landed weight in salable meat . <p> " So if you pay $4,000 for a thousand pounds of lobster , you 're actually paying $12,000 , " said Burke . <p> After shipping it out the plant door , processors and exporters of live lobster compete with one another in a crowded market . <p> " There 's no formula out there for price , " said Roger Cameron , owner of Cameron 's Seafoods in Halls Harbour , Kings County . <p> " They come to me and tell me what they 're willing to pay . I have to tell them if I can meet that . " <p> Cameron , 50 , is paying about the same price for lobster as he was paid as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard an 18-foot skiff before heading to school each morning in Port Hood , Cape Breton . <p> He buys live lobster , grades and packages them at his plant in the Annapolis Valley , and within 35-50 hours they 're on a plane to markets in Europe and Asia . <p> " Let 's say you buy 50,000 pounds of live lobster for a set price and then someone else sells 50,000 pounds for cheaper into the market , " said Cameron , " Are you going to hold out and let them die ? Or are you going to sell them at a loss ? " <p> Having grown up fishing , Cameron said he appreciates the financial stresses on fishermen and their growing costs , but with markets flooded , there is n't much money being made by anyone . <p> " It 's an industry that does n't understand itself very well , " he said . <p> Whether seafood wholesalers in Asia , Europe and the United States are willing to open their books to the panel promised by the fisheries ministers remains to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry , may be more manageable . <p> Meanwhile , Doyle is paying $25,000 a year on his licence and another $10,000 annually for his boat . Then there 's $10,000 during his two-month season for bait , $4,500 for fuel and $14,000 for crew . His big diesel motor is 7,400 hours into an estimated life expectancy of 10,000 hours -- it 'll cost $45,000 to replace . Then there 's licensing fees , wharf fees and a thousand other costs that pile up . <p> He expects to catch 15,000 to 20,000 pounds of lobster during his season . <p> He 's one of the lucky ones . He runs a convenience store-bakery in Antigonish from which he makes his living , allowing him to survive despite the tight margins . <p> Yet , despite all the frustrations , he claims to be optimistic over the results of the recent protest . <p> " We 've shown to others , and to ourselves , that we can organize and we 'll keep on them now , on top of that panel , and we wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been so much negativity that you need to have some optimism .
