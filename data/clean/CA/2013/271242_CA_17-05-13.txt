On The Simpsons , Marge mistakenly joins an Ashley Madison-type website that caters to married people looking for fun . On NCIS , an international manhunt for the killer of Eli David and Jackie Vance turns into a federal witch hunt . And Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital goes into crisis mode as a storm rages in Grey 's Anatomy .  It 's time to refill the chip bowl . If you 're wondering why you have n't had a chance to get off your couch this month , then congratulations , you 're officially in TV finale hell .  May is one of the busiest times in the TV schedule because it is the end of the traditional television season . It 's also one of the crucial " sweeps " months where programmers jockey for eyeballs to get high ratings that will help determine advertising rates .  With the stakes higher than ever , networks traditionally blow their budgets on killer finales .  The good news is that Fonzie will not try to jump over a shark as in past season finales stars such as Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane on The Simpsons , or Hilary Duff on the season finale of Two and a Half Men .  " It can be a stressful month , because you 're planning where to put your best programming to compete with the other networks , " says Barbara Williams , senior vice-president of content for Shaw Media , which includes Global Television and 19 other specialty channels . " But certainly it 's a huge month for us and there is enormous pressure . "  Advertisers are also keen to place their products during season finales since audience share can typically bump from 5 to 10 per cent , says Judy Davey , executive vice-president of media buying company ZenithOptimedia .  In the U.S. , sweep dates include November , February , May and July .  " There is a lot of competition for eyeballs , so not everything as a season finale spikes , " says Davey . " If it 's truly the final season and the last new episode that we 'll be seeing , you 'll obviously , on plot , whether there is a particular cliffhanger or even how the show is marketed all comes into play . "  In Canada , audiences are measured by BBM Canada , which uses a diary system for smaller markets and an electronic device called a portable people meter in larger markets such as Toronto and Montreal .  The meter is worn by the viewer and it picks up signals from TV sets that are translated into data on what those people are watching at all times . About 4,500 households across Canada are part of the sample group .  " For the smaller markets we typically send out diaries , little booklets that people can jot down what they 're watching in the fall and spring , " says Tom Jenks , spokesperson for BBM Canada , a non-profit organization made up of advertisers and broadcasters .  Williams , meanwhile , says the war for eyeballs never ends . After networks have served their best dishes in May , they 've still got to have something left over for the summer months .  " now and people want to see high quality shows , " says Williams . " But that means at the end of the day it 's the viewers who win . "
