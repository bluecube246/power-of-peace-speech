<h> Another study finds GMO corn to be highly toxic <p> A new study has been leaked which examines genetically modified corn and reveals that the crop contains a startling level of toxic chemicals and just is n't as nutritious as natural corn . <p> The study was reportedly run by Profit Pro and is called the " 2012 Corn Comparison Report . " It was published recently on the Moms Across America March to Label GMOs website . The group states on their website that they wish to " raise awareness and support Moms with solutions to eat GMO Free as we demand GMO labeling locally and nationally simultaneously . " They are planning on organizing several nationwide marches this year against GMOs . <p> The study gives the results of an education-based consulting company 's comparison of corn types and what the study shows is that genetically modified foods may be more hazardous than once thought . <p> Not only does the study show that the crop is hazardous to health , it further shows that it is far less nutritious than traditional , organic corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America website , the report was provided by a representative for De Dell Seed Company , an Ontario-based farm that boasts it is Canada 's only non-GMO corn seed company . <p> Honeycutt says she was " floored " after reading the study and said that , " The claims that ' There is no difference between GMO corn and non GMO corn ' are false . " <p> According to tests run by Profit Pro , GMO corn contains various elements which are absent from traditional corn , including chlorides , formaldehyde and glyphosate and they are present to the tune of 60 ppm , 200pm and 13 ppm , respectively . <p> Accordng to Honeycutt , the United States Environmental Protection Agency mandates the level of glyphosate in American drinking water must not exceed 0.7 ppm , adding that organ damage in some animals has been linked to glyphosate exposure exceeding 0.1 ppm . <p> " Glyphosate draws out the vital nutrients of living things and GMO corn is covered with it , " adds Honeycutt , further noting that the " nutritional benefits rampant in natural corn are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , in the samples used , non-GMO corn is alleged to have 437-times the amount of calcium of genetically modified versions , and 56-times the level of magnesium and 7-times the level of manganese . <p> This study takes a further step to the recent study run by Professor Gilles-Eric S ? ralini , the French scientist who ran lifetime tests on GM corn and Roundup on rats , where he showed that levels of Roundup ( Monsanto 's herbicide of which its main chemical ingredient is glyphosate ) , currently considered " safe " , can cause mammary tumors and multiple organ damage ( kidney and liver ) <p> These studies also come as a decision on Capitol Hill to approve an annual agriculture appropriations bill has been passed , despite the provision within the act which contained a rider that frees GMO corporations such as the multi-billion-dollar Monsanto Company from liability . <p> Dubbed the " Monsanto Protection Act , " this provision was written by a lawmaker who has lobbied for Monsanto , and it states that biotech companies wo n't need federal approval to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unknown . <p> It seems that the advertisement by Monsanto for Roundup , featured in the video below , may be truer than we thought :
