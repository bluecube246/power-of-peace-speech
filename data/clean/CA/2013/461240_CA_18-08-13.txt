<h> video <p> The Department of National Defence even has a nickname for its cutting-edge , covert tool : " Loki , " after the " mythological Norse shape-shifting god . " <p> Word of the federal hunt for a stealth snowmobile first surfaced two years ago when National Defence 's research and development agency posted a public tender . <p> That 2011 tendering document , however , offered few details on the future of these missions , except for the top priority : silence . <p> The project kicked off at a time when the Conservative government was laying out promises to boost Canada 's military muscle in the Far North , in a once-vaunted package of Canadian Forces upgrades the feds have largely failed to implement . <p> Prime Minister Stephen Harper is scheduled to arrive in the Arctic on Sunday for a six-day tour of the region , where his government 's main focus has gradually moved from improving the country 's northern military capabilities to promoting economic development . <p> The stealth-snowmobiles project has withstood that political shift . <p> National Defence has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on Arctic mobility for eight years , but its research branch says the evaluation of the silent snowmobile , though still in its early stages , will continue . <p> The Canadian Press obtained a report that offers a behind-the-scenes peek at how soldiers ran the prototype through " informal " tests in February across varying snow conditions on Canadian Forces Base Petawawa . <p> " These experiments compared Loki against commercially available snowmobiles already in use , testing a wide variety of the snowmobiles ' characteristics , including speed , towing capacity , endurance , mobility , usability , and of course , noise emissions , " says the heavily redacted report , acquired under the Access to Information Act . <p> In one test , military personnel used sound-meter readings to compare the prototype 's noise performance against two gas-powered snowmobiles . <p> Another trial saw the machine driven at a steady speed on a mix of flat terrain and hilly snow-covered roads until batteries died . <p> Soldiers wielding a radar gun also tested the stealth snowmobile 's acceleration as it raced 100 metres down a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least nearly as capable and reliable as a standard internal combustion snowmobile , while providing a significant noise reduction , " the report said . <p> " For military purposes , it is not enough for a snowmobile to operate quietly . " <p> The report also found potential gaps in the military 's assessments . <p> " One of the difficulties encountered in evaluating Loki is the lack of a standard set of CF snowmobile requirements , " the document said . <p> Large sections of the May report , such as test results and comments , were blacked out . <p> The document justified its omissions under different provisions of the Access to Information Act , including one that says information is withheld because releasing it could be injurious to the defence of Canada or the detection , prevention or suppression of subversive or hostile activities . <p> A government spokesman declined to make the report 's author available for comment , nor did he answer questions on why Canada 's military wants the unconventional snow machine . <p> " In general , anything in the military that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine , a spokesman for Defence Research and Development Canada , said . <p> " Whether it flies or goes on the sea or anywhere else , if it 's quieter it 's advantageous to any military . " <p> Later , in an email , Paine said the testing and evaluations are ongoing . <p> He also said the Canadian Forces are looking at different small vehicles that " can be modified to traverse all types of difficult terrain , under various conditions . This includes , but is not limited to , vehicles such as snowmobiles . " <p> In the original federal tender , Ottawa said it was seeking a snow machine that would run by gas-powered engine , but would have the capability to easily switch to a " silent mode " electric motor . <p> " The noise level of an internal combustion engine can not be reduced to an acceptable level for missions where covertness may be required , especially given the increased propagation of sound in cold , dry , Arctic air , " read the tendering document , which also indicated bids could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's research agency was " pursuing the development of a ' silent ' snowmobile for winter operations in Canada , specifically in the Arctic . " <p> The Canadian Press obtained the contract , which listed the revised price tag at nearly $620,000 . <p> The winning bid came from CrossChasm Technologies , which is based in Waterloo , Ont. , and also has an office in Montreal . <p> Simon Ouellette , the firm 's director of project development , refused to discuss the stealth snowmobile due to a confidentiality agreement with National Defence . <p> One Arctic policy expert questioned whether the cost of developing such a vehicle is money well-spent , particularly since he does n't believe there are any significant security threats in the Far North . <p> " I do n't see a whole lot of evidence that criminals and terrorists are scooting around Canada 's North on snowmobiles and that we have to sneak up on them , " said Michael Byers , a former federal NDP candidate who teaches international law at the University of British Columbia . <p> Byers said he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actual needs . Perhaps , he added , they have an obsession with high technology .
