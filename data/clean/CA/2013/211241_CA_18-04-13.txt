review : q with jian ghomeshi  jian ghomeshi brought his cbc radio one show to regina on thursday night .  q with jian ghomeshi  thursday  conexus arts centre  jeff dedekker  leader-post  if thursday night was any example , jian ghomeshi has one of the best jobs in the world .  ghomeshi , host of the cbc radio one show q with jian ghomeshi , made an incredible contribution to juno week with a remarkable two-hour show at the conexus arts centre . the show , which will be carried friday across north america on cbc radio one , sirius xm satellite radio channel 159 and u.s. public radio , was a true smorgasbord of great conversation and great music . it was entertaining , it was informative , it was enlightening . it certainly was everything anyone in the sold out crowd could 've hoped for when they decided to plunk down their hard earned money on a ticket .  as sheila coles of cbc 's the morning edition put it in her introduction , " the king " and ghomeshi was fortunate enough to bring more than enough quality artists to the show -- k.d. lang , tom cochrane , dragonette , jim cuddy , gary roberts and corb lund each spent time conversing with the amiable host .  ghomeshi 's conversation with lang , which came after she stunned the audience with the valley , hit a number of topics of interest .  after touching base on lang 's induction into the canadian music hall of fame on sunday , ghomeshi asked about her the challenges of her life and career .  " i have never felt like i was fully part of anything , " said lang . " whether it 's being gay , being a buddhist , being a canadian . it would be best to be independent of categories because thinking in those terms is deflating . "  she also admitted that there was a conscious decision about stepping away from trying to be a star -- " it takes so much energy , there 's so much pressure . you can see that justin bieber 's been struggling worth it . "  lang also drew a laugh from the crowd when ghomeshi asked her about the pressure of performing high-profile events .  " helpless and hallelujah are great songs . all i have to do is sing them and that 's pretty easy , " lang said as the crowd erupted into laughter .  lang returned to the stage later in the evening to lend a helping hand when bahamas performed lost in the light .  while much of the night 's conversation was light , ghomeshi 's chat with cochrane had some serious moments as they discussed his involvement with charitable organizations like world vision .  cochrane , who will be presented with the allan waters humanitarian award on sunday , spoke of the importance of accepting the honour .  " it means i can thank some people for inspiring me , " said cochrane . " if you get up there thinking , ' i deserve this award , ' then you probably do n't deserve the award . "  cochrane finished his appearance with an acoustic version of a the first time i 've played the song live and i 'm scared shitless , " cochrane said with a laugh .  ghomeshi also ensured that regina was represented as sandra butel , artistic director of the regina folk festival , and jayden pfeifer , an actor and comedian , were given the opportunity to , as the host put it , " tell me why regina is so fantastic . "  " people do n't live here because they do n't have anywhere better to go , " explained butel . " they live here because it 's a community that makes stuff happen . "  the evening , which featured the largest crowd ever for a remote broadcast of q , lacked one tiny detail -- it just was n't long enough .  comments  we encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts . we are committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion , so we ask you to avoid personal attacks , and please keep your comments relevant and respectful . if you encounter a in the upper right corner of the comment box to report spam or abuse . we are using facebook commenting . visit our faq page for more information .
