Tell the dogs something they have n't known all along  Here 's the answer : Of course you do . All dog owners , in their heart of hearts , are convinced their drooling pet is the canine version of Einstein , only with better grooming .  GUS RUELAS / PURINA / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ARCHIVES  Cochiti , a six-year-old whippet , competes in a diving dog competition . A new book argues dogs are smarter than you think .  CP  Stray dogs in Moscow are smart enough to use public transport , a fact accepted by Muscovites who do n't crowd them on the subway .  The thing is , they 're right : dogs are geniuses .  In this well-researched , highly readable book , author Brian Hare -- a scientist who is becoming known throughout the world as " that dog guy " -- has laid out a compelling argument for the unique genius of man 's best friend .  It 's not that your dog has the skill to paint a masterpiece or compose a a special kind of intelligence that gives them more in common with human infants than their wolf ancestors .  Written with his co-researcher and wife , Vanessa Woods , The Genius of Dogs is the first book to provide a complete look at the new world of " dog cognition , " which has been playfully dubbed " dognition . "  For hundreds of years , researchers largely overlooked the millions of domesticated dogs that serve as pets or service animals , comfortably working alongside humans .  But in the last 10 years , there has been something of a revolution in the study of canine intelligence , and Hare has been the scientist leading the charge .  " We have learned more about how dogs think in the past decade than we have in the previous century , " Hare writes . " This book is about how cognitive science has come to understand the genius of dogs through experimental games using nothing much more high-tech than toys , cups , balls and anything else lying around the garage . "  An evolutionary anthropologist , Centre . Most importantly , he 's a dog lover . And , thankfully , he 's not a blowhard .  In journalism , there 's a warning : When dealing with experts , beware the expertise . The concern is when academics write books , they tend to bash readers over the head with scientific jargon in an effort to ensure everyone understands just how clever they are .  Thankfully , Hare , aided by his journalist wife , has crafted a game-changing book that , while faithfully documenting complex research , is clear , jargon-free and relies on a simple narrative style to deliver a truly gripping read .  What does Hare mean when he says dogs are geniuses ? Well , he 's mostly referring to their ability to spontaneously make inferences , to solve problems by reading human gestures .  Hare recalls his time working at Emory University under a professor named Mike Tomasello , who was trying to figure out what makes us human . One day , Mike was lamenting that only humans understand " communicative intentions , " which allow pointing .  At that moment , the author had a flash of insight . " I think my dog can do it , " he blurted .  And , through a series of experiments in his parents ' garage with their dog , Oreo , he proved just that . It turns out that dogs have a unique ability to follow human gestures , such as pointing , to locate a food reward hidden under one of a series of plastic cups .  In fact , dogs are at the top of the class compared with wolves and chimps and other wild animals . " In short , " Hare writes , " Mike and I concluded that dogs have communicative skills that are amazingly similar to those of infants . "  The long-standing belief is that domesticated dogs are less intelligent than wild animals such as wolves and foxes , yet the central point of The Genius of Dogs is that the opposite is true -- human contact has actually increased the genius of the species .  With a nod to Darwin , Hare says A friendly wild dog , one that was willing to tolerate proximity to humans , was favoured with a great reward -- a new food supply known as " garbage . "  Hare also dispels the myth that scientists have had their senses of humour surgically removed .  In one chapter , he recounts a hilarious , if uncomfortable , evening spent in a Russian sauna , where the other researchers insisted on calling him " Brain " instead of Brian .  " I sat naked in a Russian banya , " he writes . " The air in the sauna was so dry and hot , it scorched my windpipe all the way down to my lungs ... The other eight Russian men , also naked , were leaning against the cedar walls , their eyes closed in ecstasy , as though slowly roasting yourself alive was the most relaxing thing in the world . "  There 's a lot more vodka and jumping through holes in the ice involved , but you can find that out for yourself . We also are n't going to the smartest .  You 're going to have to go out and buy the book . In fact , we suggest you pick up two -- get one for your dog , because , after all , he 's a genius .
