( handout/james gathany/center for disease control/reuters )  mosquitoes bugging you ? university of manitoba students created an app for that add to ...  it does n't ward off the annoying , blood-thirsty critters with a wave of a smartphone , but it does allow users to warn others and provide information to figure out which infested neighbourhoods to avoid .  the app , developed by a team at the university of manitoba , lets users rate mosquito activity in an area -- information that is then uploaded to a map which all users can see .  video  engineering student rory jacob says he and his colleagues came up with the idea after using similar technology being from manitoba where mosquitoes are considered the province 's " unofficial bird , " jacob says it did n't take long for them to figure out how to apply the technology to the blood-suckers .  people can check the app -- called the m tracker -- before they leave the house so they know whether to douse themselves in bug spray , he says .  " if you 're going to an area of the city , to a park or something with your family , and you do n't know if you 're going to bring mosquito spray , you can take a look at the app , " says jacob , who worked on the app with engineering professor bob mcleod and fellow student chen liu .  the city of winnipeg diligently tracks mosquito numbers using scientific traps , but the app could give officials another -- more personal -- perspective , jacob suggests .  and while mosquitoes are plentiful in western canada , the app can be used anywhere in the world .  " it 's been downloaded in russia , in map built-in to essentially tell you how the mosquitoes are in your area . "  the app has been downloaded about 200 times . jacob hopes it will take off as more people hear about it .  " realistically , the more people you get , the better the data is going to be . you 'll be able to get more consistent results out of it . "
