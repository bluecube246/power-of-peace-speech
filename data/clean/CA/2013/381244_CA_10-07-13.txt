Inside the Star  B.C. student blinded in Bangladesh attack continues her recovery  University of British Columbia student who was blinded in a vicious domestic assault during a trip home to Bangladesh has made a remarkable recovery , finishing her master 's degree and preparing to enter law school this fall .  University of British Columbia student Rumana Monzur , who was beaten and blinded by her husband during a 2011 attack in Bangladesh , smiles during an interview at UBC , where she will begin law school in September .  Rumana Monzur made headlines after she was viciously attacked and blinded by her husband during a trip home to Bangladesh in 2011 . But Monzur , who is now preparing for law school , says she does n't want to be seen as a victim .  VANCOUVER -- Rumana Monzur can picture a towering mountain or the blue sky on a sunny day . She remembers what the ocean looks like and can still conjure an image of water stretching out to the horizon .  But she has n't seen her trip home to visit her family in Bangladesh , she was the victim of a vicious domestic assault that left her blind and her husband charged with attempted murder .  " Each moment , I miss seeing her ( my daughter ) -- and not only her , I miss seeing people , " Monzur , 35 , said Wednesday .  Monzur has spent the past two years on a remarkable recovery that saw her finish a master 's degree at the University of British Columbia , where she now lives with her six-year-old daughter and her parents . She is now preparing to attend law school .  Monzur was attacked in June 2011 during a trip home to Dhaka , Bangladesh . A year earlier , she left her daughter , her husband and her parents behind in Dhaka to study political science in Vancouver .  The attack was widely reported in local media in Bangladesh , and the details of what happened , including photos of her badly injured face taken in her hospital room , quickly filtered back to her friends and colleagues in nearly $100,000 to cover Monzur 's medical and living costs once she returned to B.C. , and the case fuelled a debate about violence against women in her native Bangladesh .  Two years later , Monzur has learned to read Braille and uses adaptive technology to read and write . She uses a cane to navigate when she walks , and she no longer covers her eyes with shaded glasses . The scars on her face have faded .  She successfully presented her master 's thesis , which examined the impact of climate change and rising ocean levels in Bangladesh , this past spring , and she was recently accepted to a number of law schools . She decided to stay at UBC and will enter the school 's law program this fall .  Monzur said she tries not to think about the attack that robbed her of her vision , which she refers to only as " the incident . "  Dwelling on what happened only leads to questions without any answers .  " If I think about it , it just leads me nowhere role in that conversation , and she hopes other women and girls -- including her own daughter -- can learn from the horrors she experienced at the hands of her spouse .  " First of all , I do n't want people to see me as a victim -- I want people to see me as a survivor , " said Monzur , who added that violence against women must be brought out into the open .  Monzur 's former husband , Hasan Sayeed Sumon , was arrested and charged with attempted murder soon after the attack , but he died under mysterious circumstances in December 2011.
