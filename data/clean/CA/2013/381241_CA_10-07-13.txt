There 's even a little romantic twist in the mix . <p> As far as what the audience can expect , Petrynka said that although it 's not a farce per se , there is some slapstick and plenty one-liners . " The characters themselves and their delivery are funny . It 's very good writing . " As far as the plot , the director could n't , and would n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small town in Ontario , with period music , costumes and attitude , another great part of the fun of the show is all these beautiful cakes that the audience gets to see , she adds , including an elaborate wedding cake . <p> The seven person cast includes a lot of new faces to the company . " It 's a nice mix between veteran actor and new actors , and they all meshed so well together . It 's so nice to have new talent come out . " <p> A frequent performer with the company , this is Petrynka 's second foray in the director 's chair -- the last being Steel Magnolias a couple of years ago . She says that she loves the job and feels her acting experience has helped her out . " You get to learn what to watch for when directing . It 's definitely a challenging job , but I appreciate a challenge .
