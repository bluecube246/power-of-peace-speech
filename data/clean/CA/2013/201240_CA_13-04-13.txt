The sweetness contrasted with the zip of the red wine vinegar makes this Crispy Maple Beef a morsel by morsel mouth-pleasing wok winner .  Ingredients :  1 lb stir-fry beef  1 1/2 tsp baking soda  3 tbsp water  Vegetable oil  1 cup cornstarch  1 large egg white , lightly beaten  1 tsp sesame oil  3 cups prepared white rice  Sauce  4 tbsp maple syrup  4 tbsp red wine vinegar  2 tbsp soy sauce  1 tsp cornstarch  1 . Mix the beef , baking soda , and 3 tablespoons of water in a medium bowl . Cover , and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight ( the baking soda will tenderize the steak ) .  2 . To make the sauce , mix the syrup bowl . Set aside .  3 . Heat a large wok over high heat . Add enough vegetable oil to come about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the wok , and heat to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile , add the cornstarch and egg white to the beef , and mix well to coat .  4 . Cook the beef one small batch at a time ( about 1/2 cup ) so that it does not bring the temperature of the oil too low . Stir gently until it begins to look crispy , about 1 minute . Using a wire mesh strainer , transfer the beef to a colander to drain . Remove any fried bits from the wok .  5 . Return the beef to the wok , and fry again until crispy all over , about 2 minutes . Transfer to a strainer to drain . Discard all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the wok .  6 . Return the wok to high heat . Add the beef , sauce mixture and sesame oil . Stir-fry until all of the ingredients are steamed rice .
