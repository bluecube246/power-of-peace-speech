life after the party : independent mps free to vote as they please after leaving world of ' tribal ' partisan politics  independent mps say they have no regrets over their exile to the margins of the political process .  bruce hyer left the ndp caucus , and later his party , 21 months ago after he was " punished " for voting against the party line to scrap the long-gun registry . ( he joined the greens about two weeks after this interview , but argues he 'll continue to operate very much as an independent . )  brent rathgeber quit the tory caucus in june after colleagues gutted his private member 's bill on public servant salary disclosure , but remains a member of the conservative party .  you can count on your fingers the number of independent mps who get a bill into the senate  maria mourani was tossed from the bloc quebecois caucus in september for speaking out against the parti quebecois ' values charter and quit the party after her ouster .  postmedia news sat down how their experiences have changed their views on partisan politics . here 's what they had to say .  ( aside : dean del mastro sits as a conservative independent . he left caucus after he was charged under the elections act in october but hopes to return once his legal battles are resolved . )  on the joys and challenges of political independence :  " liberating " is how rathgeber describes independence . before he could n't vote how he wanted on legislation , or " speak freely " in the house . there were " attempts " to edit his blog and his tweets and he was expected to " cheerlead and promote the government rather than question it , vet it and hold it to account . "  mourani enjoys a more flexible schedule that gives her more time in her riding . she no longer feels " constrained " by caucus and is better able to work with the government whip , house leader and ministers on files .  her private member 's bill on human trafficking even received unanimous support last the number of independent mps who get a bill into the senate , " she said .  though he can no longer participate in committees , hyer enjoys getting a question a week during question period and being able to " work across party lines . " he 's also amazed at the number of times he 's introduced an idea only for it to be rejected and later scooped up by another party .  still , all admit there are challenges . independent mps have the same office budgets and staff complements , but without a party to tell them how to vote , they have a lot more reading to do on subjects that do n't necessarily match their areas of expertise .  it 's a big reason hyer decided to go green .  on partisan politics and what needs to change :  hyer said he always felt partisan politics was " too tribal " but " did n't realize to what degree " until he got involved .  he has a lengthy list of remedies for what he believes ails the democratic proportional representation , wants randomized seating in the commons and for the names of political parties to be stripped from the election ballot .  noting he has the " dubious honour " of having the only private member 's bill in canadian history to pass the house only to be killed by the senate , he wants the chamber abolished . a " wild new " alternative , he said , would be for party leaders to choose senators for a single term based on their proportion of the popular vote .  both hyer and rathgeber also support conservative michael chong 's private member 's bill to limit the power of party leaders . so , too , does hyer 's new boss -- green party leader elizabeth may .  rathgeber maintains he 's " not anti-party " and believes they play a " critical role educating the electorate " during elections .  " between elections , i believe that their complete and total preoccupation with partisan considerations as opposed to what i think are more critical issues like the merits or lack of merits about a damaging for good governance , " he added .  mourani said the problem lies with personality more than procedure .  people who are " dictatorial , " do n't listen to their mps or respect their expertise , do n't dialogue with them and surround themselves with " yes-men " are just bad leaders , she said .  on friends and foes :  mourani , then the bloc 's only female mp and a member of a visible minority , received widespread support across party lines after her expulsion for standing up for religious minorities . the charter seeks to bar quebec public servants from wearing overt religious symbols to work .  none of her bloc colleagues came to her defence , she said , adding others in the wider independence movement agreed she was treated unfairly .  rathgeber said there was only ever " subtle animosity " over his departure among caucus colleagues , who the self-described " workaholic " seldom socialized with anyway due to his lack of interest in their favourite pastime -- hockey .  for hyer , a jack layton agonizing " and there are some in caucus and in his old riding association who have n't gotten over it .  he has few kind words for then-interim leader nycole turmel and whip chris charlton whose decision to discipline him prompted his departure , but said he gets more " hugs and smiles " in his riding than " discouraging comments . "  hyer and rathgeber have also become friends and allies over their mutual interest in democratic reform and both agree may has been a godsend even if they do n't agree on everything politically .  " she 's been very , very helpful administratively and helping me navigate the waters of an independent , " rathgeber said .  hyer said he agrees with the six core principles of may 's party and was swayed to join by the fact the greens do n't whip votes .  on their political futures :  mourani said she will " never again vote for the bloc or the pq " and shortly after this interview , announced she was no longer a sovereigntist .  she knows likely run in the next election .  rathgeber said he will defend his seat in 2015 as an independent conservative , though he expects the harper conservatives will " throw everything and the kitchen sink " into defeating him in edmonton-st . albert .  " they 'll have to make a choice , " he said . " do they want a party loyalist . . . or do they want an independent conservative who will . . . assess each piece of legislation and will support those that are meritorious and that benefit the constituents . "  hyer said he felt " like the prettiest girl at the dance " as " several parties " wooed him .  still , he decided to go green , has paid his membership fees for three years and will run under the party banner in 2015 , if he runs .
