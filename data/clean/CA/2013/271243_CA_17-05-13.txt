After a brilliant academic career in music in which professor Lois Choksy wrote six non-fiction texts , she retired and turned her imagination to another genre , fiction . It was something she had always wanted to do so she wrote her first fictional potboiler and took it to her big publisher who had released her previous professional books .  " They were n't in the least interested in my fiction , " she recalls , still with surprise . " They said ' get an agent ' . "  An editor sent her a constructive critique of her book and Choksy realized she would have to find her own voice - and learn more about writing in her chosen area , romantic suspense . At retirement age she went back to school to take university courses to learn about dialogue , plot arcs , pacing and cliff-hanger chapters , none of which was necessary to write books about music . After attending an intensive workshop in Oregon she learned that her way of writing must involve the reader through stronger characters .  " , " she said .  All of Choksy 's current books to date have strong women characters in them .  The music professor chose the pen name of Blair McDowell , and she set out to grab the hearts of her biggest reading market , women .  She will read from her latest book , Sonata , set in Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast , at the Gibsons Public Art Gallery this Saturday , May 18 from 2 to 4 p.m .  Settings are also a strong feature of the McDowell books .  Her first novel , Memory of Roses , ( Rebel Ink , 2011 ) was set in Greece , a country she loves . Her next , Delighting in Your Company ( 2012 ) , springs from a remote island setting in the Caribbean where Choksy has owned a place for 45 years . The island evokes myths and brims with the history of slavery and this has been incorporated into a ghost story around a romantic character .  " But nothing that I see any place else is as beautiful as through the trees to the Strait of Georgia from her porch at her bed and breakfast business near Gibsons .  The denouement of her latest , Sonata , takes place in a cabin in Smuggler 's Cove and her cast of characters includes a half-Asian heritage cellist , Sayuri , who returns to her family 's Vancouver mansion to find that her widowed father has taken a new and younger bride , Alyssa . The three live together uncomfortably andSayuri escapes into her concert recitals and a rekindled romance with detective Donovan ( and his huge dog , Buttercup ) who is investigating a jewellery robbery at their home . Sparks start to fly when Alyssa 's handsome brother shows up unexpectedly and woos Sayuri .  Not surprisingly , the character of Sayuri is based on several of Choksy 's music students from her time as a professor of music at the University of Calgary . She taught many Asian students , usually string players , and saw how dedicated the students were to their art , and how , as children , they had no life but their U.S. publisher Rebel Ink Press and on Amazon . Locally , they are at Woods Showcase and Marketplace IGA in Gibsons . The Saturday afternoon reading and refreshments at the GPAG is open to the public . All are welcome .
