<h> The Canada Revenue Agency is supposed to explain the reasons behind its decisions , but when it fails to do so , you can complain without fear of reprisal <p> Lawyer Marc Weisman was working with a company that had fallen behind on its taxes . He worked out a deal with the Canada Revenue Agency to pay the arrears over an extended period . <p> " I was preparing the postdated cheques when the CRA called a day later , saying it could n't agree to the deal . The client would have only half the time we agreed on , " he recalls . <p> " When I asked why we could n't keep the longer payment period , I was told , ' It 's our policy . ' I asked to be sent the policy . The supervisor said there was no policy available . " <p> He said he would complain on his client 's behalf and got a shocking reply . <p> " A CRA employee told me , ' If you make a complaint , I 'm going to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " says Weisman , who works in the tax law group at Torkin Manes LLP in Toronto , <p> In another case about interpreting a clause in the Income Tax Act , he wrote to the CRA , citing legal arguments and precedents . <p> " The response was , ' We disagree . ' I asked for more information , so I could explain to the client what the CRA 's position was . I got the same response . " <p> Weisman met with me and Taxpayers ' Ombudsman Paul Dub ? last week to talk about the need to strengthen the taxpayer bill of rights . <p> Earlier that day , National Revenue Minister Gail Shea had announced measures to ensure that taxpayers could complain and request a review without fear of CRA reprisal . <p> " People should feel free to speak up . We wo n't tolerate any abuse of authority by employees , " she told reporters at a CRA office in Scarborough . <p> While there was no direct evidence of misconduct , Shea said she takes such allegations seriously . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to employees found to be threatening taxpayers . <p> Dub ? , a lawyer named as the first taxpayers ' ombudsman in 2008 , called it " a significant step forward " for those who had reservations about complaining about poor service . <p> In five years on the job , he 's talked to a wide cross-section of taxpayers and to recipients of government benefits tied into their tax returns . <p> He 's heard many people express concern about consequences arising from a complaint to the CRA , saying they were reluctant to exercise their rights . <p> That 's why he asked for a 16th right to be added to the taxpayer bill of rights , hoping to increase confidence that the system would be administered fairly . <p> " Not only has the Minister heard and accepted my recommendation , " he told the news conference , " but the CRA is committed to implementing it . " <p> Complaints about employee misconduct would go to a person 's supervisor , Dub ? told me . This was unacceptable , given a common perception that bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complaints about misconduct will be investigated by a separate office within the CRA , similar to the internal affairs department of the police . <p> The taxpayer bill of rights has no legal force and does not cover tax policy . It talks about rights to privacy and confidentiality , timely information and relief from penalties and interest because of extraordinary circumstances . <p> Under the 11th right , the CRA says it will be accountable for what it does : " When we make a decision about your tax or benefit affairs , we will explain that decision and tell you about your rights and obligations . " <p> There 's a toll-free number to call the Office of the Taxpayers ' Ombudsman , 1-866-586-3839 . Those outside Canada and the United States can call 613-946-2310 . " Please note that we accept collect calls , " says the website.
