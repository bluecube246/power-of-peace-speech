The Okanagan champions built enough cushion from a 29-18 halftime lead to hold off the chard-charging Belmont Bulldogs in the eighth and final contest of the Sweet 16 dance card .

Belmont had grabbed the 20th and final berth to the championships when it defeated the Oak Bay Bays in a challenge game following the release of the tournament draw . The Titans face Vancouver 's Kitsilano Blue Demons in the quarterfinals on Thursday ( 3 p.m . ) . <p> WRCA 69 ENVER CREEK 66 ( OT ) <p> LANGLEY -- Third time was almost the charm for Surrey 's Enver Creek Cougars . Despite two previous losses to the crosstown rival White Rock Christian Academy Warriors , the Cougars were looking like a team ready to giant killers , and on Wednesday they almost pulled it off . Enver Creek 's Aaron Nand hit two free throws with 6/10ths of a second remaining in regulation to force overtime , but the Warriors scored the first five points of the extra session , battling and clawing its way to a 69-66 win . " Enver is a great team , they have a lot of length and a lot of weapons , " said WRCA head coach Dale Shury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Surrey RCMP Classic and the Fraser Valley tournament . " I knew we had to play close to our best game to beat them . We did n't , but I ca n't take anything away from the effort that they gave tonight . " The Warriors bolted out to a 23-10 lead , and Enver Creek trailed by as many as 15 points before the Phil Deeks ' -coached squad made a rip-raoring fourth-quarter comeback . Four players -- ( WRCA 's Sam Ykema , Peter Spangehl , Vartan Taneilian , Enver 's Gurkirat Kular , David Ahmad ) -- never left the floor , logging all 45 minutes . Tanielian led the Warriors with 20 points , Spangehl added 19 and 16 rebounds , while Matt Perrin scored 14 . For the Cougars , Kular scored 23 points , Rajan Gill 12 , Nick Jhauj 11 and Ahmad 10 . WRCA faces WJ Mouat in a quarterfinal on Thursday ( 4:45 p.m . ) . <p> KITSILANO 65 TERRY FOX 54 LANGLEY -- Randy Coutts called it a case of first-game-itis . That and a stubborn crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demons scratch and claw for everything they got Wednesday en route to a 65-54 victory and a berth in Thursday 's quarterfinal round . " They did n't go away and they played good on the interior , they did a good job of stopping Luka from getting the ball , " Blue Demons head coach Randy Coutts said of the defending B.C. champion Ravens , who despite heavy off-season graduation losses , did their best to limit the effectiveness of Kits ' blue-chip forward Luka Zaharijevic . " But that said , we looked offensively stagnant with the ball , " continued Coutts . " Our guys , their legs looked heavy and I do n't know if that was the first game of the tournament or what . Hopefully this is a wakeup call for us . " The Blue Demons were set to scout the day 's last game , between Okanagan champion South Kamloops , and Vancouver Island challenge winner Belmont , both surprise entries in the 20-team field . " We 'll be there to scout them out , " said Coutts , whose team had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two appearances . " I have no idea of either team . So we 'll put together a game plan and try to get ready . " Thursday 's game was tied 28-28 at the half , and the Ravens , who had three Grade 10 players on the floor down the stretch drive of the game , pulled to within four late before coming up short . Zaharijevic had 19 points , 15 rebounds and five blocks , teammate Noah DeRappard-Yuswack 16 points and 15 rebounds . Tom Campbell added 14 for the winners . The Ravens top two scorers were 10th graders . Guard Liam Hancock had 11 points and nine rebounds , forward Mike West a team-high 15 points . <p> WALNUT GROVE 74 SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL 62 <p> LANGLEY -- They met in the seventh grade at DRIVE basketball academy , and pretty soon afterwards , Jadon Cohee and Mindy Minhas had become fast friends . " He plays the wing and I play the point , " Cohee said of the pair during their spring and summer club seasons . " We 're best friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in their high school careers , the pair had to oppose each other , and what unfolded was a showdown of sorts between two of B.C. 's elite Grade 11 talents . In the end , despite a prodigious line score that read 27 points , 16 rebounds and seven assists , the 6-foot-5 guard Minhas and the rest of Vancouver 's Sir Winston Churchill Bulldogs found themselves on the short end of a 74-62 score to Cohee and the rest of Langley 's No. 1-ranked Walnut Grove Gators , who move on to the quarterfinals tonight ( 8:15 p.m. ) against the Burnaby South Rebels . " I am looked upon to score a lot but my whole goal was to shut down Mindy , " admitted Cohee , who nonetheless finished with 21 points , six rebounds and five assists . " He played a hell of a game . Once we 're on the court , the friendship is off . But after 40 minutes , we 're friends again . " Minhas concurred , but was having a hard time with the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw was over . " If you 're not first , you 're last , " said Minhas . " I am going to be thinking about this all of next season . But I know we are only going to get better from here . " The Bulldogs played about as perfect a game as could be expected against a Gators team which returned almost all of its talent from the team which lost in last season 's final , sits No. 1 in The Province 's Big 10 rankings , and is coming off a win over White Rock Christian in the Fraser Valley final . " Sometimes you have to win ugly , gritty and we did that today , " said Gators ' head coach George Bergen , whose team led just 68-62 with 2:20 remaining when Churchill guard Andrew Claur drove the baseline for a layin . " They had scouted us fairly well because they did a good job in defensive transition opportunities . But in the second half , we got grittier and we won the battle on the glass . " Jesse Mushiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Shin scored 15 for the Gators . <p> ST . GEORGE 'S 93 CLAREMONT 80 LANGLEY -- For a guy who is a raw rookie to all the splendour of playing on B.C. basketball 's highest stage , Drew Urquhart does n't shy away from speaking his mind . " The lights are bright here and it was intimidating , but we came out and played hard and aggressive , " Saint George 's 6-foot-7 Grade 11 swingman said after his team advanced to Thursday 's Elite 8 quarterfinals following a 93-80 win over Victoria 's Claremont Spartans . " Today , my shot was falling but I stayed aggressive . " That aggressiveness has come from now winning four sudden-elimination games in its post season , and Urquhart , behind a 26-point , 21-rebound performance , was helping to lead the way . " " I give Drew an eight-out-of-10 , " said Saints ' head coach Bill Disbrow . " I think he was real good , but I think he can be better and I think he will be tomorrow . " Urquhart had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 rebounds , while guard Deklan Chung scored 21 . The Saints will get all they can handle Thursday from the Yale Lions in the quarterfinals . <p> BURNABY SOUTH 73 SARDIS 69 LANGLEY -- The Burnaby South Rebels spent an entire regular season testing and re-testing their ability to bend but not break . It 's an old clich ? for sure , but one that a young team took to heart , putting it on display over a fourth quarter Wednesday morning that carried them into the quarterfinals here at the B.C. senior boys Triple A basketball championships . " In the last three weeks we have been doing that , playing through for the whole 40 minutes , " said Rebels head coach David Smith after his charges built a 14-point lead near the end of the third quarter , then gave nearly all of it back before re-trenching to stop Chilliwack 's Sardis Falcons 73-69 in the first of eight Sweet 16 matchups at the Langley Events Centre . When South point guard Gino Pagbilao drained a three-point bucket with 1:38 left in the third , Burnaby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead and all of the game 's momentum . But a Sardis team , making its school 's first B.C , tourney appearance in the 80-year history of the school , came storming back . And when Falcons ' Grade 11 big man Hayden Lejeune was fouled taking a three-pointer , he was able to step to the line with a chance to pull his team to within 71-70 . Lejeune made the first two , then missed the third . After the Rebels made a free throw to make it 72-69 , Sardis ' Cam Servatius launched a trey that could have tied the score with 5.2 seconds remaining . The Rebels , the Lower Mainland finalists , advance to face the winner a later Wednesday game between Walnut Grove and Sir Winston Churchill in Thursday 's Elite 8 quarterfinals . " That was a good team , and we had to stop the big guy , " Smith said of Sardis ' Lejeune , " so we junked it up on defence and we seemed to stall them a little . Everyone worked hard and we took control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pagbilao finished with 15 points and seven assists , while fellow senior Dejan Posavljak , the 6-foot-6 forward , scored 14 points . Two other Rebels hit double figures , as Martin Bogajev scored 17 and Nick Garcha 13 . Lejeune finished with 17 points and 14 rebounds , while guard Mike Gregory led the Falcons in scoring with 18 points . Jason Kroeker with 11 and Eric Rogers with 10 also hit double figures in the loss for the Falcons . Smith credited the step-by-step focus of the season for making a difference in the level of team that took to the floor Wednesday versus the one that opened the start of the season in late November . " It 's hard to finger one thing , but individually they just got better , " Smith said of his team . " And they understood once the pressure was on , that they had to play together and sacrifice . Earlier in the season that was n't the case . " <p> W.J. MOUAT 74 HANDSWORTH 65 LANGLEY -- Tristan Etienne is getting more and more at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . The talented 6-foot-9 Grade 11forward was at his best Wednesday , shooting 8-of-9 from the field and finishing with 21 points , 18 rebounds and five blocks as the W.J. Mouat Hawks of Abbotsford outlasted North Vancouver 's Handsworth Royals 74-65 . " He struggled a bit in the Fraser Valley championships , and for him it is all about energy and playing as hard as he can , " admitted Mouat head coach Rich Ralston . " There was no doubt today that he came in ready to go . " Handsworth jumped out to a 25-16 lead early , but the Hawks went on a 26-7 run to build a 42-33 lead at the half , then found ways to hunker down and answer each and every Royals push over the second half . " It always helps my confidence when I can come out and help my team get a win , " said Etienne , who still has one more high school season remaining but is starting to hold the attention of collegiate programs . " I am just trying to help us keep moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are hoping that we find our peak right here at the end of the season . " Both Etienne and guard Corey Hauck got stronger and stronger as the game progressed . Hauck and fellow point guard Jesse Feenstra each finished with 12 points , while forward Daniel Pawliuk and Mitch Howden each reached double figures on offence as well , with 13 and 10 points respectively . Handsworth swingman Luka Petkovic hit a trio of triple early and finished with a game-high 24 points for the Royals , while point guard Adam Karmali added 12 points and guard Arman Amini added 10 points . The Hawks , a fourth-place finisher at the Fraser Valleys , advance to meet the winner of a later Wednesday game between White Rock Christian Academy and Enver Creek . <p> YALE 95 CALEDONIA 63 LANGLEY -- JJ Pankratz has already got his collegiate basketball future figured out . Jauquin Bennett-Boire has a few years left to figure it , but he 's already playing like a full-fledged senior . That was the story Wednesday in the Sweet 16 round , as the two standouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Lions weathered through a stern push from Terrace 's Caledonia Kermodes to score a 93-65 victory . The Simon Fraser-bound Pankratz scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the victory , while Bennett-Boire , a 6-foor-1 Grade 10 guard , continued to show his remarkably mature game , scoring 21 points , dishing 11 assists and grabbing six rebounds for the winners .
