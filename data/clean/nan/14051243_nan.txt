" One is that they 'll stop people when they really should n't be stopped and two , they 'll stop people who they believe wo n't complain about having been stopped for no good reason and if they complain , will not be believed . " <p> Fancher said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to stop a young person of color or any person who appears to be poor or powerless . <p> " If the police are stopping people when they should n't be stopping them and the people know that they should not have been stopped- then those are the ingredients for frustration , for anger which can boil over and cause some very unintended and undesirable results , " Fancher said . <p> If the ACLU 's concerns sound familiar it 's because you 've heard it before from a former cop . <p> " Now the police I do not believe for a minute are inherently racist , but the policies that are put in place , reward a racist behavior , " said Craig Tuer , former MSP trooper . <p> Back in March we interviewed state trooper Craig Tuer--a 20-year veteran with Michigan State Police . <p> He told us about the 70 percent baseline evaluation troopers have to meet . In that story MSP denied having a quota for tickets but acknowledged one of the areas subject to that baseline evaluation , was traffic stops . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiling , " Fancher said . " What we are saying is we 've spotted what we regard as a hazard . It 's very much like when you have broken glass on a pool deck . It may be that no one has cut their feet but you still sweep up that glass so that there are no injuries . " <p> While the ACLU praises MSP 's policies that prohibit racial profiling , the group finds the state police practice of not always recording the race or ethnic backgrounds of those stopped troubling . Because there would be no way to find out if certain people were in fact being singled out . <p> In response to the ACLU 's letter , Michigan State Police said this : <p> " The MSP wholeheartedly disagrees with the ACLU 's statement that the Activity Analysis program is ' problematic because it can create an incentive to stop motorists without proper grounds when troopers have deficient stop records and they become desperate to meet supervisors ' expectations . ' <p> " Troopers are trained to stop motorists only if there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe criminal activity is afoot . Stopping motorists without proper grounds or using race , ethnicity , or gender to select whom a trooper stops is in direct violation of the MSP Code of Conduct . " <p> The ACLU has been in conduct with state police since the letter was sent Wednesday . A state lawmaker is working that would beef up racial profiling guidelines within police and sheriff departments across the state . But the last time that came up it did not get very far .
