josh graff , uk managing director of the professional social network , said competition from within the uk and abroad , coupled with high living costs , meant businesses in the capital must do more to attract the best talent .  capital tech ' exodus '  " i 'm always amazed at the trends you can get from our data , " graff told techweekeurope . " london is a great magnet for talent . in software , the number of professionals has shot up year-on-year and is the highest rate of growth from all the industries we were monitoring . "  " but with grads specifically , london was losing a third of its talent . some of the talent is flowing to other parts of the uk and others are going internationally -- the us , china and germany .  " there is an urgency for london-based tech companies to double down and make sure they are continuing to attract the best talent . our message is to start to be concerned about the potential exodus and start thinking about your need to have tools to refer graduates . "  wider issues  " as an industry we need to solve the challenges young graduates face , " he said . they want to stay in the city but need help financially . i do n't think that 's unique to the tech industry . "  " as an industry , and government , we need to be collectively working . if you look at what the mayor and everyone does that with tech specifically , they 've voiced their commitment to the sector . there 's a positive view there . "  graff recognised that a skills gap was partly to blame for the difficulty in recruitment , but he also said that as more businesses digitise , the greater the competition for talent .  " digital has changed every company , " he said . " tech companies would traditionally compete with other tech firms but in today 's environment everyone is competing for engineers , so it 's important to brand yourself to other communities . "  is it really that bad ?  ?  london has long had a reputation for drawing in britain 's best young minds , arguably to the detriment of the rest of the uk .  with regional tech hubs and superfast broadband making it easier than ever to work in any part of the country , perhaps a re-balancing of the digital economy is a good thing .  graff was more guarded on this issue , accepting that a less london-centric economy had its benefits but that the point about a capital exodus still stood .  " a partial departure from london is n't a bad thing because it provides value to the rest of the country , but tech firms need to make sure this is n't an exodus , " he said . " i think there 's wonderful opportunity for grads in all sectors to find placements elsewhere in the country . that is net positive for the uk economy , but i do think in london specifically there is an exodus of talent in tech and software . "  what about brexit ?  and what about brexit ? any employers to recruit the best minds , something the capital 's tech community made it abundantly clear in both the run up to the london mayoral elections and the eu referendum .  " i do n't want to speculate too much as there 's a lot we do n't know , " said graff . " london and the uk specifically has one of the most international workforces in the world and its ability to compete with other cities in the world is important . even before brexit the battle was keeping up and this has exacerbated it . "  " it is incredibly important to keep london as a hotbed of tech talent . with that uncertainty , but the advice we give to individuals and companies does n't change .
