The Magpies resume after the international break with a home game against Dean Smith 's side  Get Newcastle United FC news by email  The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video  Newcastle fans now know there are no easy games in the Sky Bet Championship .  The home defeats against Huddersfield and Wolves were the perfect example of that earlier in the season .  And the clash with Brentford is also another match that looks like a potential banana skin game for the Magpies .  Victory for United would allow them to climb into the top two until Sunday afternoon at least with the Terriers playing on Sunday against Sheffield Wednesday .  Referee  Simon Hooper ( Wiltshire )  Hooper also took charge of Newcastle 's opening night defeat against Fulham back in August .  Prediction  Brentford made the play-offs last season and know their way around this division .  Their form has been patchy so the play-off zone in the Championship .  On paper , this probably looks like three points for Newcastle but when you consider that the Bees won 2-0 at Brighton and picked up a draw away to Aston Villa it 's safe to say they are not daunted by big away days .  Brentford could take some breaking down but Newcastle should net three more points .
