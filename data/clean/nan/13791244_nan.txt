the system recently installed at the sunrise eggs production unit in seagrave road , sileby is capable of moving 70,000 eggs an hour onto pallets .  it features a robot head capable of picking up 720 eggs at a time .  sunrise eggs are laid at farms in leicestershire , shropshire and norfolk and the business packs around four million -- up from 2.25 million a few years ago -- each week for big supermarket chains , local shops and foodservice companies .  sunrise eggs commercial manager chris stocks said : " the sorting and palletising of the eggs is now completed 45 per cent faster than previously . " removing the need for hand palletising from our daily schedule has allowed our staff more husbandry time for the birds . "  he said the abb irb 6400 robot -- installed by wales-based rm group -- uses precision programming to pick up trays of eggs with great accuracy .  the bespoke robot heads are designed to fit the egg trays contours and the eggs are gently moved from accumulator to pallet . any risk of distortion that occurs to the tray when palletised by hand -- which could lead to breakages .  " strategically placed sensors ensure the tray is clear of the forks before the robot fully retracts , eliminating the possibility of damage .  " this new machine is at the end of three laying houses in a collection area . eggs are conveyed loose from the hens over the moba farmpacker we installed last year .  " the moba farmpacker turns them all the correct way -- points down -- and staff are able to remove ' seconds ' manually at this stage .  " they are then automatically packed onto plastic trays of 30 eggs each and automatically stacked .  " the new robot lifts four stacks of six trays at a time -- that 's 720 eggs per lift -- and turns and stacks them onto specially made plastic pallets .  " every 12 stacks -- that 's four lifts -- it makes a layer and a plastic divider is placed on top by the robot .  " this leaves only .  " after four layers made up of 8,640 eggs , the pallet is full and the process starts again . and all the eggs are presented straight every time . "  he said the equipment had not resulted in job losses . the company employs around 80 people and has added jobs .  he said : " automating repetitive processes and making production more time and energy efficient means we continuously improve our processes .  " but care of our flocks , the maintenance of quality standards and dealing with customers and suppliers , are all jobs that only great staff can do -- no matter how gentle and efficient the robot might be .  " and robots need to be very carefully maintained , which also requires more specially trained staff . "  2 comments  but you 're no better than a trot if you just point out the obvious problems with a system without providing any solutions or improvements . if you do n't have a decent minimum wage , then even people in full-time work have to claim benefits , is coming to a lot of jobs , and as long as we cling on to the notion that everyone needs to work full time to make money , unemployment is only going to keep rising .  and all the lefty morons who think they can force through unrealistic minimum wage rules take a look at your future . just as the lemmings in the us are now finding out . they thought they were in line for 15 dollars an hour . what they are actually getting is layoff notices . just as i predicted to the tusc muppets on here a year or two ago when they were all over this site demanding massive hikes in minimum wages .
