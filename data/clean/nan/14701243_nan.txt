Credit : FREE IMAGES <p> Loos said FNB 's house price index for last month showed further slowing in year-on-year growth compared with August and had now shown slowing growth for five consecutive months . <p> " The slowing rate of house price growth is the lagged response to over two years of gradual interest rate hiking since early 2014 as well as a broad multiyear stagnation in the South African economy to near zero growth by the first half of 2016 , " he said . <p> FNB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent year on year , which was a further slowing on the revised 4.8 percent growth rate recorded in August this year . The average price of homes transacted last month was R1 056 774 . <p> Loos said the onset of some mild deflation was evident when examining house price growth on a month-on-month basis . This suggested that there might once again have been renewed economic weakness along with housing market weakening in third quarter after a mildly better second quarter . <p> The housing market could often be a good leading indicator of economic conditions . <p> Up until May this year , month-on-month seasonal house price growth accelerated after a dip early this year . <p> Loos said this was accompanied by a significant uptick in the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) after a similar dip early in the year , which was also accompanied by a return to mildly positive growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter after a contraction in the first quarter . <p> But Loos said more recently both the FNB house price index and the Manufacturing PMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . <p> From a level in June this year of 53.7 on a 100-point scale , the PMI had dropped significantly to 46.3 by August while month-on-month seasonally adjusted house price growth had gone from plus 0.5 percent in May to minus 0.4 percent decline last month . " Therefore , if the housing market is anything to go by , it points to a possible re-emergence of economic weakness in the third quarter of 2016 after a slightly better second quarter , " he said . <p> In real terms after adjusting for consumer price index ( CPI ) inflation , the rate of house price growth was negative at minus 1.1 percent year on year in August this year after revised negative growth of minus 0.3 percent in July . Loos said the turn to real house price deflation pointed to a deteriorating market balance between supply and demand . <p> Other FNB indicators had also pointed to a weakening market balance , including the FNB estate agent survey average time of homes on the market . <p> Loos said FNB expected average house price growth to hover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would translate into a decline after CPI , with probably little support from a very weak economy .
