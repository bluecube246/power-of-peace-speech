messi should not captain argentina - passarella  daniel passarella does not believe lionel messi is the right man to captain argentina .  passarella skippered argentina to their first world cup title in 1978 and was part of the squad that triumphed again in mexico eight years later .  the south american giants are without a senior international trophy since lifting the copa america in 1993 , with messi a defeated finalist on four occasions - three of which have come in the past three years .  the barcelona forward retired from international duty after the penalty shootout defeat to chile in the copa america centenario final in june , but he later reversed his decision and was given the armband by new coach edgardo bauza .  passarella has questioned that decision , claiming centre-back ramiro funes mori is better suited to the role .  " not giving the captaincy of argentina to messi would take a weight off of him , " said the former argentina coach in an interview with chilean publication el mercurio .  " i think argentina mori . he should be the captain .  " the leader of the group is something different to the way you play and the talent of each player .  " i admire messi , but i think his personality , his way of being , is withdrawn and timid . "
