<h> Messi should not captain Argentina - Passarella <p> Daniel Passarella does not believe Lionel Messi is the right man to captain Argentina . <p> Passarella skippered Argentina to their first World Cup title in 1978 and was part of the squad that triumphed again in Mexico eight years later . <p> The South American giants are without a senior international trophy since lifting the Copa America in 1993 , with Messi a defeated finalist on four occasions - three of which have come in the past three years . <p> The Barcelona forward retired from international duty after the penalty shootout defeat to Chile in the Copa America Centenario final in June , but he later reversed his decision and was given the armband by new coach Edgardo Bauza . <p> Passarella has questioned that decision , claiming centre-back Ramiro Funes Mori is better suited to the role . <p> " Not giving the captaincy of Argentina to Messi would take a weight off of him , " said the former Argentina coach in an interview with Chilean publication El Mercurio . <p> " I think Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mori . He should be the captain . <p> " The leader of the group is something different to the way you play and the talent of each player . <p> " I admire Messi , but I think his personality , his way of being , is withdrawn and timid .
