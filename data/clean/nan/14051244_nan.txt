He made remarks against Islam and Muslims during the talk about immigration and refugees.Jeremy HoganHerald-Times  A discussion on immigration and refugees disrupted by a scuffle this week showed the importance of having such a conversation , organizers say .  The United Methodist Women hosted a forum and panel discussion about immigration and refugees Wednesday evening at Bloomington 's First United Methodist Church . It was advertised on a flier as a chance to " ask critical questions and engage in an educated conversation the challenges associated with the U.S. immigration system . "  Instead , shouting and shoving ensued . Police were called .  Sara Batman , vice president of the United Methodist Women , said she never expected the event to garner the reaction it did from the public . In some ways , she said , it shows the importance of an issue that has strong voices on both sides .  " Though the event did not go as planned , we are looking forward to continuing the conversation of how best to welcome and care for those in need and those immigrating to the U.S. from all regions of the world , " Batman said .  But not everyone believes immigrants or refugees should be allowed to enter the U.S. -- like one man who expressed his beliefs at the event on Wednesday . He identified himself only as " Ed . "  He told those in attendance that followers of Islam wish to curse the U.S. and that the religion is one of hate . Despite pleas from those around him to stop , he from him . A scuffle ensued , police were called and officers escorted Ed from the church .  The United Methodist Women organization conducts educational meetings throughout the year and invites guest speakers to the church for discussions . Usually , only members attend such meetings .  What made this occasion different was the importance of the topic and the diverse panel of experts , Batman said . The group decided to extend an invitation to the public . Though not widely advertised , Batman suspects news of the meeting spread through word of mouth .  She said if the organization does something like that again , it will try to establish clearer rules regarding public comment .  That is a practice city and county officials say they use to guide public discussion at their meetings . Bloomington City Council member Susan Sandberg , who has served on the nine-member panel since 2007 , said the council seeks to keep a civil forum through formal rules .  The council allots a certain amount of time for comments on topics not included on the week 's agenda . People usually adhere to the time limit and thank the council for having a chance to comment , Sandberg said .  If people get belligerent or physically violent , though , council members can signal to a police officer present during the weekly meeting .  " We 've had to sometimes bring the gavel down and have someone removed , but it 's rare , " Sandberg said . " People understand in our forum , we want to keep it respectful . "  Diekhoff , who served as a council member from 1999 to 2007 , sat on the city council at a time when uniformed officers were not assigned to the meeting detail .  Then , the council had a plan in place , he said . Should a member of the public become disruptive , cause problems or incessantly interrupt council members , the meeting would be adjourned until the person calmed down .  Diekhoff could not recall putting that plan into action , but the contingency was there .  " The best course of action would be to just adjourn to do , but it de-escalates the situation , " he said .  It 's also best to avoid confronting a member of the public who becomes disruptive , he said . It has the potential to make matters worse .  Monroe County Council member Geoff McKim said ground rules for public comment have to be strictly and consistently enforced . And those moderating must , likewise , show respect while audience members speak .  " If you are chairing a meeting , you need to make sure that you give the speakers your attention , even if you disagree with what they are saying , " McKim said .  Liz Grenat , executive director of the Community Justice and Mediation Center in Bloomington , said agreed-upon rules for public comment can cultivate a supportive environment for personal expression . That does not mean there wo n't sometimes be conflict . It can be helpful to have someone trained in conflict resolution on hand to get things back on track .  * An update on the Grassroots Conservatives ' campaign to block the resettlement of Syrian meeting on Wednesday .
