olympic sailing : giles scott in command of finn class after second day of competition  giles scott threw down the gauntlet to his finn rivals as a dominant day two display propelled him to the top of the leaderboard in rio yesterday .  four-time world champion scott , based on portland , took advantage of almost britain-esque conditions of 20-plus knots and grey skies to take second place in the day 's opening race -- race three of their event overall -- before leading from start to finish in their second race to claim pole position at the top of the finn class rankings .  the 29-year-old olympic debutant was left ruing a poor opening race to his regatta on wednesday , finishing 17th after getting caught on the wrong side of a wind shift on the notoriously shifty sugarloaf course .  but with the finns racing outside of guanabara bay on the ocean today , it was conditions scott revels in and he was not about to waste the chance to begin his regatta in earnest .  he said : " i was really pleased to come away with a first and a second , especially after a frustrating start .  " in the first race i actually went to the wrong windward mark , because we were quite close to the leeward end of the laser fleet , so that was a bit of an error but i managed to pull back through to second .  " it was quite nice to get some windy conditions just to dig your heels in and grunt up .  " rio was quite kind to us on the outside courses .  " when we were towed in past the races on the inside bay it looked like a different world , it was quite surreal . "  with three races now completed the sailors can discard their worst score from their series , meaning scott 's 17th is now currently discounted .  slovenia 's vasilij zbogar , a two-time olympic medallist in the laser , led overnight but scores of seven and 10 today saw him leapfrogged by the brit , while alican kaynar ( tur ) sits currently occupying a top 10 position is already discarding a score of 10th or higher with six races still to go , meaning there is virtually no margin for error for the remainder of the regatta for any sailor .  the finns are set to resume racing back inside the bay on the escola naval course from 5pm bst tomorrow before a rest day on friday , and scott will be keen to make sure he goes into the lay day on a high .  he added : " there is still an awfully long way to go and the racing in rio is particularly tough , it is going to throw all sorts at us so we really just have to be mindful of that and prepare as much as possible .  " the finns are a very technical class it 's very tactical and also very physical so i think if you get races that hit all those areas it 's only good for the sailors . "  the finn class is scheduled to contest an 11 race series , with the one off medal this website and associated newspapers adhere to the independent press standards organisation 's editors ' code of practice . if you have a complaint about the editorial content which relates to inaccuracy or intrusion , then please contact the editor here . if you are dissatisfied with the response provided you can contact ipso here
