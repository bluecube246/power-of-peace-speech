<h> Services <h> In Japan , pop groups have a lot of members - the most popular one has 48 ! <p> POP groups have been popular across the world for many years . I remember the excitement of S Club 7 - there were 7 of them ! <p> It was such a new concept to have a larger group filled with choreographed , smiling young things . Little did we know , across the sea in Japan , this was no longer a new idea . <p> They are known as ' idol groups ' . These are manufactured pop groups that come with a huge following of all ages across Japan . The most popular group right now is called AKB48 - That stands for Akihabara 48 . Akihabara is the big ' geek ' area of Tokyo , where the group is in residence , and 48 is the number of members . Yes , you read that right - 48 members ! Japanese idol groups are often much bigger in size than any western music groups , but fans still know all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own theatre and cafe in Tokyo . Every day , different line ups of members perform and take pictures with fans . This kind of culture means fans feel much closer to these groups than any others . <p> But it also has its issues , as one can imagine . A large number of these idol groups fans are usually adult men , rather than young girls . Most of the fans are there because the girls are cute , and they enjoy the music and cute dance moves ; but others often have more serious feelings towards these young girls . Only a couple of years ago , two of the members ( who were 18 and 19 years old at the time ) were attacked with a saw after one of their concerts by a crazed fan . <p> Although AKB48 is easily the most famous and beloved group in Japan right now , they have sparked a trend of similar groups across the country , and even into Korea . All these groups involve large numbers of young girls or guys , who are able to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even part talent show . Every year , the fans will vote for their favourite member , and the winner will become the number One girl in the group . She will then be the leader for the rest of the year - every idol girls dream ! <p> What do you think about these idol groups ? Can you imagine them working well here in the UK , or they too weird , even for us ? <h> Ipsoregulated <p> This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .
