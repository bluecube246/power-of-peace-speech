" The rumours of my death were vastly exaggerated . " The level of uncertainty that the world is grappling with is clearly not just in the Indian IT sector . Janet Yellen , the Fed chief , recently remarked , " Extreme economic events have often challenged existing views of how the economy works and exposed shortcomings in the collective knowledge of economists " . <p> Having said that , there is no denying that the industry is buffeted by short-term factors , which have had an impact on the results of some of the bellwether companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a deeper look at medium to long-term horizon will reveal that the macros remain in place , and cynical gross exaggerations about where the industry is headed , remain unfounded . <p> By now , it is pretty obvious what the short-term factors are and their seismic impact . These include , but are not limited to , Brexit and the impact of a weakening pound taking a toll on financial conditions and market sentiments . Slowdown in BFSI , a result of low interest rates , which has led to many advanced-economy banks facing profitability challenges related to low net interest margins and delaying discretionary spending in the sector . <p> The uncertainties surrounding US presidential elections is leading to slowdown in decision making . While short-term challenges do provide grist to the mills of sceptics , we should not jump to hasty , ill-founded conclusions . We should also draw succour from the fact that this is not the first time the IT industry is confronting severe challenges . I am quite confident that the industry is robust enough to negotiate these humps successfully , this time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the future will be considerably different from a mere linear extrapolation of the present and will not be characterised by the current business models . <p> Analysts indicate that global IT spend is steady right now , and if anything , there 's been a rise , albeit not a sharp one . For India too , the overall share has remained constant and not reduced . I do believe that the current adverse conditions are in the process of bottoming out and are unlikely to witness any further free fall . What is noteworthy , however , is that within the sector , results have not been uniform . A top-line growth for instance , has been offset by flat margins and vice versa , which adds to the complexity in interpretation . Also , the industry can not have a one-size-fits-all outlook . It is much diversified with a mix of sub sectors -- IT services , BPM and engineering and have different growth rates . In addition , GICs and MNCs contribute about a third of the total exports basket and are seeing a constant growth trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indian companies increasingly focus on building digital platforms to redefine how their services/solutions can be delivered . This has led to de-coupling of revenue and productivity . Simply put , the industry revenue of $100 billion saw three million people being added , but the next hundred would require less , only about half that number , as the Nasscom-McKinsey study indicates . While the commonly held threat perception about job losses remain , the opportunity to get re-skilled in new areas is unmistakable . <p> Technology disruption eventually creates better jobs than what it takes away . Interestingly , the average deal sizes are getting smaller ( $0.18 billion in 2015 to $0.14 in 2016 YTD , IDC ) , rendering higher chances for new entrants to claim a share of the pie , especially in the digital business . Enterprises are opening up to the idea of new sourcing models and creating opportunities for entrants . The demand will be for a combination of domain knowledge , consulting experience and technological expertise . In 2016 , there has been an increase in contracts that combine both consulting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities , the interlinkages between smaller niche players and large companies have been growing stronger and spurring collaborative models or acquisitions . <p> The Indian IT industry is not about services exports alone . An under-served domestic market provides new opportunities for the industry . The gargantuan challenges that the nation is grappling with in the areas of healthcare , education , financial inclusion , are all perceived as billion-dollar opportunities . Certainly , solutions which will work for India will find resonance in other markets as well . Ecommerce and technologies driving the shared economy are also worthy mentions here , with phenomenal growth rates . <p> The Nasscom-McKinsey study indicates that the level of digital adoption and its consequent impact will not be uniform . Digital attackers , followers and laggards will co-exist and the industry in India is building solutions to address all the three constituents . It is wild speculation to predict that a $150-billion industry that has been painstakingly built over several decades , which today disseminates best practices in more than 80 countries , will evaporate overnight . New opportunities will enable industry to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . India will continue to be the largest producer of world-class engineers and data analysts/scientists and to innovate at scale , India is and will be the destination . Rest on our laurels ? We definitely should not and wo n't ; the digital future we are learning , and the current bump will act as a catalyst for the industry to make that inevitable leap into the future and cross the chasm.
