Asserting that the human rights violations in entire Pakistan cry for the world 's attention , India called on Islamabad to focus its energies on " setting its own house in order " and acting against the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on its neighbours instead of ritually raking up alleged human rights violations elsewhere .

We would suggest Pakistan to first fulfill its primary obligation under the resolutions to vacate illegal occupation of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir , " read India 's statement . India further called upon Pakistan to stop inciting and supporting violence and terrorism in any part of India and refrain from meddling in its internal affairs in any matter . This is the second attack by India against Pakistan internationally , as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had labelled the neighbour as the " mothership " of terrorism at the BRICS Summit in Goa earlier this month . <p> " In our own region , terrorism poses a grave threat to peace , security and development . Tragically its mothership is a country in India 's neighbourhood . Terror modules around the world are linked to this mothership . This country shelters not just terrorists . It nurtures a mindset . A mindset that loudly proclaims that terrorism is justified for political gains . It is a mindset that we strongly condemn , " @ @ @
