the walk came days after islamophobic posters were littered across the university of calgary campus .  some of the 40 posters discovered tuesday morning depicted bearded men who appeared to be screaming and made references to sharia law and genital mutilation .  some posters also said muslims should " keep their barbaric ways right where they belong , " and some linked to facebook pages that recommend that islam be banned in canada .  the incident took place about two weeks after posters targeting the sikh community were discovered at the university of alberta in edmonton .  rabbia rabbani was one of hundreds taking part in the sixth annual unity and peace walk to commemorate the sacrifice of imam hussain . ( kate adach/cbc )  raised in calgary since the age of eight , rabbia rabbani , 19 , said she has n't experienced islamophobia but the conversation around understanding and acceptance is an important one , especially in the wake of those incidents .  " a lot of the stigma and a lot of the hatred that comes toward anything " she said .  " if people start to understand what we stand for and what we think and what we believe is n't something to be feared , then there would n't be a need for all this hatred that comes toward , not just us , but everyone else as well .
