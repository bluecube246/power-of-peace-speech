That part of my world has moved on . " <p> There was always two blonde ones and another one . I was the other oneCraig Logan on Bros <p> Since leaving Bros , Logan has managed the likes of Tina Turner and Sade and helped launch Robbie Williams ' career . <p> He was head of RCA Records from 2006 to 2010 and now runs his own company , the London-based Logan Media Entertainment , which looks after artists including Anastacia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking exclusively to BBC News , Logan said the Bros reunion had come as a surprise but " totally had his blessing " . <p> The comeback was announced last week , initially as a one-off concert at London 's O2 Arena , exactly 28 years after the band 's final show , at Wembley Stadium , in 1989 . <p> After the show sold out in seconds , brothers Matt and Like Goss announced a full UK tour , taking place in August and September 2017 . <p> In his only interview about the reunion , Logan spoke to the BBC about his memories of the band , including his collection of 1980s leather jackets , and how he has forged a career as one of the music industry 's most influential executives . <p> Image copyrightRex FeaturesImage caption Bros were , for a brief period , the biggest pop band on the planet <p> Hello , Craig . What has this last week been like for you ? Has the phone stopped ringing ? <p> It 's been absolutely crazy . A lot of emails , a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way . It 's a bit of fun . <p> Did you know the announcement was coming ? <p> This time , no . We 've spoken about it many times over the years , and they totally have my blessing . <p> If you got the call , would you go up there and do a five-minute bass solo ? <p> Ha ha ! You know what ? I think they know that it 's not something that interests me . That part of my world has moved on . <p> At the press conference last week , Matt said : " As far as I 'm concerned , Bros is Matt and Luke . " What did you make of that ? <p> Oh , you know . They 're launching a tour as the two of them , so that 's fine . There was always two blonde ones and another one . I was the other one . <p> This is something they 've really wanted . It 's not something I 've wanted . They will do great , they 'll put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Image copyrightRex FeaturesImage caption Craig ( right ) quit the band after a period of illness <p> I came across a photo of you playing at the Hammersmith Odeon , wearing a white polo neck sweater with the word ' bass ' stitched into the collar . Do you remember it ? <p> Do you know what , I think I 've still got that ! I 've definitely got all the jackets - with words like bass , groove , boogie on them . They 're up in the loft somewhere . They 're not hanging up in the cupboard . <p> Or in a glass display case in the living room ... <p> No , not on display . But I am very proud of the time I was in Bros . I would do it all again . <p> What 's your favourite memory ? <p> I was 17 when it all kicked off . And we travelled the world , being friends , playing in front of huge audiences and that was real fun . But I was never comfortable with fame , in all honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Push , sold seven million copies <p> When did you realise it was n't for you ? <p> Actually , it was pretty simple . I was unwell at the end of 1988 . We were on tour in Berlin and I had what they called ME at the time now known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome . And at that point , I was so weak . I had just had enough . <p> I was going out with Kim Appleby at the time , from Mel and Kim , And Mel was going through lots of treatment for cancer . I remember looking at her and thinking : " What am I doing ? This is crazy . This is not worth it . " <p> Is it right you started piano lessons at the Royal School of Music , wearing a disguise to avoid the Brosettes and the paparazzi ? <p> I did ! I did n't want to learn about Beethoven and Bach , but I wanted to understand the theory of music , about chords and harmony . That 's what propelled me into songwriting and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . <p> At the same time you were in court , trying to get out of the contracts you 'd signed as part of Bros . Is that what prompted you to move into the business side of things ? <p> Exactly right . I used to go in the lawyers ' offices in the morning and we 'd go through things piece by piece . That really helped me understand how this business works . How artists get paid , how royalties are split up , how contracts are worded . It was the foundation for pushing me into the business side . <p> As someone who manages artists now , do you warn them about signing dodgy contracts ? <p> In all honesty , we had a contract that we were advised not to sign but we decided to sign it . We felt it was the right way to propel us forward - and you know what ? It was the right decision . We did OK out of it . <p> Image caption Bros had 11 top 40 hits between 1989 and 1991 <p> You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pink and Joe Cocker . Such big artists can be a handful , so what was your secret ? <p> One of the big things that 's been a real benefit for me is the fact I 've been out there . I 've made records , I 've toured , I 've made videos , I 've sat in a Norwegian hotel room and done 10 interviews one after the other - so I could relate to an awful lot of the artists . <p> With Robbie , they said : " You 're ex-boyband , he 's ex-boyband , you guys would be great together . " So I used to travel with him a lot . <p> Some of the shows they were planning , I 'd actually done myself . So I could give them first-hand experience . And that has definitely benefitted me . <p> You signed Pink after her first album and steered her towards becoming a global star . How did that come about ? <p> When we started making the Missundaztood record in 2001 , we all had visions of it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary one . She was the one who wanted to work with songwriter Linda Perry . <p> One day I went to pick her up in LA and she said : " I was in the studio with Linda Perry last night , and I 've got this song . Do you want to hear it ? " And she played me Get the Party Started . It was just a demo but she could see I loved it . She has incredible instincts . <p> But the best artists usually have a vision of where they want to go , and your job is just to keep them on the train tracks . <p> What 's the one bit of advice you give all your artists ? <p> Listen - because none of us know it all . You 've got to soak up what 's around you . <p> And then I 'm always looking for the little glint in their eye , and I always try to scare them a little bit . I do n't mean in a bad way - but you 've got to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound glamorous , but this is hard work . You do n't just turn up and strum a guitar a couple of times a week . And they have to understand how hard that 's going to be on their personal lives . <p> You 're about to launch your own record label . Given the state of the record industry , is that a wise idea ? <p> I think it 's a great time to have an independent label . The key before was always distribution . You 'd rely on an awful lot of other people to get your records into shops . Now , distribution is pretty straightforward to set up . After that , you have to understand how to build an international strategy for any particular artist . <p> Cher Lloyd is a great example . We hit a problem in the UK on her debut release and a lot of people would have gone : " Well , that 's that then . " But we took her to America and we sold two or three million records and built a business for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label , a new publishing company and also a TV sync company - for putting music into TV and film - is I want to have lots of routes to the market for my artists . You just have to be nimble . And if you put some knowledge in there , and some skill in there , you can actually do some damage .
