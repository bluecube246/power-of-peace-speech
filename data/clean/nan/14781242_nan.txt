Trump started pulling punches before the debate even started , holding an impromptu press conference where he was joined by four women : Juanita Broaddrick , Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones , who allege they were sexually assaulted by Clinton 's husband , and Kathy Shelton , who was raped in 1975 when she was 12 . Then a lawyer , Clinton was appointed to defend Shelton 's rapist , and in an interview years later , was recorded laughing while speaking about the case .  After the women finished speaking , a CBS reporter asked about the comments Trump had made on the tape - specifically , about his claiming that his star status allowed him to touch women without consent . The reporter was immediately shouted down by Trump supporters ( " Why do n't you ask Bill Clinton ? ! " ) before being escorted out .  In a press release shortly after , Clinton 's communications director Jennifer Palmieri called the conference " Trump 's latest act of desperation " on his " destructive race to the bottom . "  the first audience question , and as anticipated , co-moderator Anderson Cooper asked Trump about the tape .  " No , I did n't say that at all , " Trump responded , apologizing for the remarks and saying he was n't proud of them , but repeated that they were " locker room talk . " He then started speaking about the atrocities committed by Daesh , otherwise known as the Islamic State or ISIS .  But Cooper steered the answer back to the tape , pushing Trump on whether he had actually kissed or groped women without consent .  " No , I have not , " Trump eventually responded , but not before saying , " nobody has more respect for women than I do . "  In her response , Clinton said it was clear to anyone who heard the tape that " it represents exactly who he is because we 've seen this throughout the campaign , " pointing out that Trump has not only insulted , rated , and attempted to embarrass women , but has also attacked immigrants and minorities bring down the cost of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , while improving coverage , the candidates offered up two approaches - fix it up , and tear it down .  Clinton agreed that premiums , copays and prescription drugs costs have gotten too high and said she would focus on fixing what was wrong with the Act instead of starting from scratch . She pointed out several changes since the Act was introduced , like how insurance companies can not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition , and that 20 million Americans previously without health insurance were now covered .  ?  When speaking of President Barack Obama 's signature health care law , Clinton says she wants to ' save what works ' while Trump says it needs to be replaced with a less expensive system .  On the other hand , Trump called Obamacare a " disaster " that was too expensive and would implode by 2017 . Trump said he would repeal and replace it something that would allow multiple insurance companies to come in and compete , which would drop 's " single-payer plan ... would be a disaster , somewhat similar to Canada , " Trump said , describing the Canadian health care system as " so slow " and " catastrophic in certain ways . "  On Muslims and Islamophobia  " There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States , and I 'm one of them , " a question-asker started , and asked how each candidate would address the rise of Islamophobia in America .  Responding first , Trump said the asker was right about Islamophobia " and that 's a shame , " but throughout his answer emphasized that " there is a problem " with " radical Islamic terrorism . "  " Muslims have to report the problems when they see them , " Trump said , listing the San Bernardino attacks and 9/11 as examples .  Later on , when asked about his proposed ( and then retracted ) ban allowing Muslims to enter the US , Trump said he was for " extreme vetting . "  Clinton took a more community-based view , saying that the U.S. and ears on our front lines " and that American is " not at war with Islam . "  " I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else , " Clinton said to the question-asker .  The moderators managed to squeeze in one more audience question at the end ( and an oddly sweet , non-political one at that ) - could each candidate say one positive thing he or she respected about the other ?  That the Trump children are all successful , Clinton said , reflected positively back on him as a father , even though she does n't agree with his opinions . She added that she was a mother and grandmother herself , and that the Nov. 8 election will be one of the most " consequential " in history .  Trump said he took that as a compliment , and in turn , said he respected that Clinton " is a fighter . " He added that , for the most part , he disagrees with what Clinton is fighting for and or give up .  Quips  " It 's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country . " -- Hillary Clinton  " Because you 'd be in jail . " -- Donald Trump  " Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 per cent increase over Obama . People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are , where they are from , what their feelings about our country is , and she wants 550 percent more . This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time . " -- Trump  " Donald Trump is different . I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief . And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing . What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women , what he thinks about women , what he does to women . " -- Clinton  " No , did you -- no , answer the question Raddatz  " Why do n't you interrupt her ? You interrupt me all the time . " -- Trump  " I do . " -- Raddatz  " Why do n't you interrupt her ? " -- Trump  " Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands ? " -- Raddatz  " As I recall , that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln . It was a master class watching President Lincoln get Congress to approve the 13th Amendment . It was principled , and it was strategic . And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it . " -- Clinton  " We have an increase in murder within our cities , the biggest in 45 years . We have a divided nation , because people like ( Clinton ) -- and believe me , she has tremendous hate in her heart . And when she said deplorables , she four years of Barack Obama , and that 's what you 're getting with her . " -- Trump
