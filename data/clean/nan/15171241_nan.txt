Addressing a mini rally at Ayirebi in the Ofoase-Ayirebi constituency of the Eastern region , Mahama reiterated God is the only one who ordains a leader .  " Power rests in the hands of God , He decides who becomes a leader . So when I see somebody ( Nana Addo ) carrying himself as an already elected President , I say if God says he wo n't make you a President , you can move heaven and earth you will still not be President , " the NDC presidential candidate said
