The teachers submitted their resignation to university Registrar Isfaqul Hossain under the banner of pro-liberation war platform of teachers around 10:30am Monday .  Acting proctor of SUST Emdadul Hoque told the Dhaka Tribune : " A total of 35 teachers have submitted their resignations from different administrative posts . "  He said : " Some of the teachers hold multiple posts , so 37 posts fell vacant after the resignation . "  The tension was generated on the SUST campus on April 13 when 19 teachers from the physics department and geography and environment department of the university went to hold a talk with the VC over space allocation between the departments .  Prof Dr Syed Badiuzzaman Faruque , head of the physics department , and Prof Dr Sharif Md Sharafuddin , head of the geography and environment science department , resigned on the same day following the alleged misconduct of the VC .  The teachers placed an ultimatum that at least 43 teachers of administrative departments of the university would resign on Monday if the vice-chancellor did not resign by Sunday as their demand was not met ; however , the teachers are now determined to resign from their posts .
