<h> ' Avengers ' expands universe with ' Ultron ' as Marvel goes dark <h> The caped crusaders are back in force in " Avengers : Age of Ultron , " but this time , the evil they battle is bringing them face to face with the darker consequences of being a super hero . <p> " Age of Ultron , " the sequel to Walt Disney Co 's 2012 Marvel blockbuster " Avengers " and out in US theaters on Friday , will see its star-studded super hero ensemble - Iron Man , Thor , Black Widow , Captain America , The Hulk and Hawkeye - tackle their own fears . <p> Writer-director Joss Whedon said he wanted to " perform a little open heart surgery " on the Avengers , and " let the audience experience them on a more personal level than they ever have before . " <p> In " Age of Ultron , " Marvel 's super hero worlds come crashing together as the super heroes tackle a complex villain in Ultron ( James Spader ) , spawned out of artificial intelligence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietro ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson ) , known as Quicksilver for his super speed , and Wanda ( Elizabeth Olsen ) , the Scarlet Witch with thought-altering magic powers , Ultron makes the Avengers at times turn on themselves . <p> Robert Downey Jr , Marvel 's Iron Man and patriarch of the franchise , said given the present day " world stage , " now is the time for the Avengers to get real . <p> " This is where you have to actually start dealing with the ramifications of saving the world , " he said . <p> Business of going dark <p> The trend toward somber super heroes has already proved to be a winner at the box office for other studios . The 2013 Superman film " Man of Steel , " from Time Warner Inc 's Warner Bros , made more than $660 million worldwide . The studio 's " Dark Knight " Batman trilogy grossed more than $2 billion globally between 2005 and 2012 . <p> Olsen said " Age of Ultron " allows audiences to see the " most human versions " of the seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional and more based on the characters as people , as opposed to super heroes , " she said . <p> " Avengers " became the third-highest grossing film of all-time , and " Age of Ultron , " made for $250 million , is expected to match , and possibly surpass , its predecessor 's $1.5 billion take at the global box office . <p> The strategy to tackle more serious themes may aid the film 's box office , said entertainment industry analyst Hal Vogel , " because it seems to reflect a change in the social mood . " <p> Ahead of its US debut on Friday , " Age of Ultron " amassed $201.2 million across 44 countries , outpacing its predecessor 's opening weekend take . <p> Unlike the first film in which the Avengers ' battle wreaked destruction without consequences on Manhattan , " Age of Ultron " shows the super heroes very conscious of the human cost of their war against evil . <p> In one scene where Iron Man and The Hulk obliterate a skyscraper , the aftermath drew comparisons to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a very fine line , and that may be a place we crossed it - we were all worried about that , " Whedon said . " At the same time we felt it would be disingenuous to say these guys trashed a city and there 's no consequences . "
