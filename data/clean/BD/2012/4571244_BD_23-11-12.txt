<h> ODI Squad Announced <h> Gazi makes the cut <p> Sports reporter <p> Off-spinner Shohag Gazi , who has impressed in the ongoing Test series between Bangladesh and West Indies , has been rewarded with a berth in Bangladesh 's 14-man squad for the first two one day internationals , which was announced yesterday . <p> Gazi has picked up eleven wickets in the series so far and has been Mushfiqur Rahim 's go-to bowler . <p> Apart from Gazi , Rubel Hossain and Naeem Islam are the other two players who have returned to the side after missing out during the Asia Cup , which took place in March this year . <p> Rubel , who returned from a shoulder injury , impressed the selectors with his effort in the Test series . Naeem 's inclusion in the squad was propelled by his maiden Test century in the second innings of the first Test match . <p> Young Abul Hasan , who became only the fourth person in the history of Test cricket to score a century while batting at number ten , was also named in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Asia Cup squad in March , following Shafiul Islam 's injury . He , however , did n't make it to the playing eleven . <p> Imrul Kayes , Elias Sunny , Nazmul Hossain , Shahadat Hossain and Nazimuddin , who were a part of the ODI squad during the Asia Cup were dropped by the selectors . <p> " Nazmul Hossain is injured and is n't fit enough to be in the team . Nazimuddin has n't been performing well lately and he did n't get too many runs during the Asia Cup , " said Akram Khan , Chief Selector of the Bangladesh cricket team . The selection committee also backed their quickest bowlers for the ODIs-Abul and Rubel- as a result of which , Shahadat Hossain had to miss out . <p> Kayes 's exclusion was mainly due to his lean form with the bat in domestic cricket , where as the inclusion of Gazi , alongside Shakib Al Hasan and Abdur Razzak , meant that there was no room for Sunny in the team . <p> Bangladesh and West Indies will each play one warm-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ODIs will take place in the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna on November 30 and December 2 respectively . The players will then return to Dhaka to play the remaining three ODIs and one Twenty20.
