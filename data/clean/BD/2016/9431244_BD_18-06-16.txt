<h> The proposed budget focuses on the mobilisation of larger domestic resources . This is the first part of a two-part long form <p> The cost of doing business is likely to increase Photo- BIGSTOCK <p> The proposed national budget for 2016-17 envisions an expenditure outlay of Tk3,40,605 crore , 29% higher than the outgoing fiscal 's revised outlay . However , the revenue earnings estimate for the next fiscal is Tk2,42,752cr , about 37% higher than the revised figure of Tk1,77,400cr for the outgoing fiscal . <p> Around 71% of the expenditure outlay is expected to be covered by revenue earnings . The size of the formal GDP , at current market price , is estimated to be Tk19,61,000cr , which was estimated at Tk17,16,000cr in the outgoing fiscal . <p> Out of the total revenue collection target in the coming fiscal , NBR-sourced income is estimated at Tk2,03,152cr , which is 35% higher than the revised figure for 2015-16 , and such high levels of estimation without the proper instruments -- ie an effective automation system , capable NBR architecture , reduction in harassment by tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into collecting revenue in any way it can . <p> However , it 's good to know that the NBR has achieved its revised revenue target of Tk1,30,000cr , with a surplus of Tk3,000cr during the July 2015 to May 2016 period . It is also good to note that the NBR thinks its revised revenue target of Tk1,50,000cr for the outgoing fiscal is likely to be exceeded by Tk10,000cr , though it will fall short from the Tk1,76,000cr as was originally planned . <p> The strategy of the proposed budget focuses on the mobilisation of larger domestic resources through the expansion of the tax base , establishing social equity through reduction of income inequality , protection and development of our domestic industries , incentives for savings and investment , development of small and medium enterprises , and discouraging the import of luxury goods . <p> These goals are pretty similar to the earlier budgets and usual are for an emerging economy such as Bangladesh . <p> The NBR 's laundry list also seems to be fairly in line with what was being discussed in various forums in recent days : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduction of the discretionary power of tax officials , reduction of tax disputes through alternate dispute resolution ( ADR ) , developing tax-payer-friendly procedures , reduction of harassment and encouraging tax payment , and , most importantly , increasing the use of IT within the tax administration . <p> Income tax <p> The revised target for income tax in the outgoing fiscal is Tk51,796cr . In light of a better opportunity space and increased focus , the figure has been proposed to be increased by almost 39% , to Tk71,940cr , in the coming fiscal . <p> Changes are sought to be brought in 46 sections and three schedules of the Income Tax Ordinance by the Finance Bill 2016 . <p> Though the threshold of tax-free income limit of individuals remain unchanged at Tk2,50,000 , by reducing the investment limit from 30% to 20% of total income , and investment rebate from a flat 15% to around 10% , individual tax-payers earning Tk40,000 to Tk1,00,000 will be penalised with a heavy tax burden . <p> Additionally , through the modification of Section 82C , the procedure of claiming refunds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor vehicles , etc , has been discontinued . <p> This will increase the tax burden through the non-adjustment of refunds in the following years , when the assessee needs an additional tax payment . <p> From now on , a year-end tax liability of tax-payers ca n't be less than the total tax deduction at source . <p> Again , imposing tax on the income of provident fund , gratuity , and workers ' profit participation funds will increase the tax liability of an assessee . <p> The corporate tax rate remained unchanged , except for RMG companies , which has been reduced from 35% to 20% , but tax deduction at source ( TDS ) on export proceeds has been increased from 0.6% to 1.5% . This is likely to give a good break to the RMG owners . <p> Under the new budget , the cost of doing business is likely to increase due to some amendments in the ordinance . There are various increments in the rate of tax deduction which companies ca n't claim and adjust with the tax liability of following years , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the total tax deduction at source in that year . <p> The NBR now prescribes a minimum tax with enhanced rates ranging from 0.6% to 1.0% . <p> As per amendment , income tax at source has to be deducted on the invoice price , inclusive of the VAT amount , which ultimately has to be borne by the company pushing their business costs . Furthermore , tax-payers are afraid of the introduction of an audit of a half-yearly with-holding tax return . <p> The government proposed October 30 to be Tax Day , ie the due date for filing of returns by all individual assessees . Income threshold for the exemption of SMEs engaged in production increased to Tk36 lakh from Tk30 lakh . <p> The limit of perquisite disallowance raised from Tk4,50,000 to Tk4,75,000 ( increased to Tk25,00,000 for disabled employees ) . <p> Any amount up to Tk10 lakh , with respect to the waiver of the margin loan ( for the purpose of investment in shares , debentures , mutual funds , and securities in a stock exchange ) or interest thereof , would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading right entitlement certificate .
