the proposed budget focuses on the mobilisation of larger domestic resources . this is the first part of a two-part long form  the cost of doing business is likely to increase photo- bigstock  the proposed national budget for 2016-17 envisions an expenditure outlay of tk3,40,605 crore , 29% higher than the outgoing fiscal 's revised outlay . however , the revenue earnings estimate for the next fiscal is tk2,42,752cr , about 37% higher than the revised figure of tk1,77,400cr for the outgoing fiscal .  around 71% of the expenditure outlay is expected to be covered by revenue earnings . the size of the formal gdp , at current market price , is estimated to be tk19,61,000cr , which was estimated at tk17,16,000cr in the outgoing fiscal .  out of the total revenue collection target in the coming fiscal , nbr-sourced income is estimated at tk2,03,152cr , which is 35% higher than the revised figure for 2015-16 , and such high levels of estimation without the proper instruments -- ie an effective automation system , capable nbr architecture , reduction in harassment by tax into collecting revenue in any way it can .  however , it 's good to know that the nbr has achieved its revised revenue target of tk1,30,000cr , with a surplus of tk3,000cr during the july 2015 to may 2016 period . it is also good to note that the nbr thinks its revised revenue target of tk1,50,000cr for the outgoing fiscal is likely to be exceeded by tk10,000cr , though it will fall short from the tk1,76,000cr as was originally planned .  the strategy of the proposed budget focuses on the mobilisation of larger domestic resources through the expansion of the tax base , establishing social equity through reduction of income inequality , protection and development of our domestic industries , incentives for savings and investment , development of small and medium enterprises , and discouraging the import of luxury goods .  these goals are pretty similar to the earlier budgets and usual are for an emerging economy such as bangladesh .  the nbr 's laundry list also seems to be fairly in line with what was being discussed in various forums in recent days : , reduction of the discretionary power of tax officials , reduction of tax disputes through alternate dispute resolution ( adr ) , developing tax-payer-friendly procedures , reduction of harassment and encouraging tax payment , and , most importantly , increasing the use of it within the tax administration .  income tax  the revised target for income tax in the outgoing fiscal is tk51,796cr . in light of a better opportunity space and increased focus , the figure has been proposed to be increased by almost 39% , to tk71,940cr , in the coming fiscal .  changes are sought to be brought in 46 sections and three schedules of the income tax ordinance by the finance bill 2016 .  though the threshold of tax-free income limit of individuals remain unchanged at tk2,50,000 , by reducing the investment limit from 30% to 20% of total income , and investment rebate from a flat 15% to around 10% , individual tax-payers earning tk40,000 to tk1,00,000 will be penalised with a heavy tax burden .  additionally , through the modification of section 82c , the procedure of claiming refunds on motor vehicles , etc , has been discontinued .  this will increase the tax burden through the non-adjustment of refunds in the following years , when the assessee needs an additional tax payment .  from now on , a year-end tax liability of tax-payers ca n't be less than the total tax deduction at source .  again , imposing tax on the income of provident fund , gratuity , and workers ' profit participation funds will increase the tax liability of an assessee .  the corporate tax rate remained unchanged , except for rmg companies , which has been reduced from 35% to 20% , but tax deduction at source ( tds ) on export proceeds has been increased from 0.6% to 1.5% . this is likely to give a good break to the rmg owners .  under the new budget , the cost of doing business is likely to increase due to some amendments in the ordinance . there are various increments in the rate of tax deduction which companies ca n't claim and adjust with the tax liability of following years , as the than the total tax deduction at source in that year .  the nbr now prescribes a minimum tax with enhanced rates ranging from 0.6% to 1.0% .  as per amendment , income tax at source has to be deducted on the invoice price , inclusive of the vat amount , which ultimately has to be borne by the company pushing their business costs . furthermore , tax-payers are afraid of the introduction of an audit of a half-yearly with-holding tax return .  the government proposed october 30 to be tax day , ie the due date for filing of returns by all individual assessees . income threshold for the exemption of smes engaged in production increased to tk36 lakh from tk30 lakh .  the limit of perquisite disallowance raised from tk4,50,000 to tk4,75,000 ( increased to tk25,00,000 for disabled employees ) .  any amount up to tk10 lakh , with respect to the waiver of the margin loan ( for the purpose of investment in shares , debentures , mutual funds , and securities in a stock exchange ) or interest thereof , would not be trading right entitlement certificate .
