Donald Trump 's Republican presidential bid has received the backing of Sarah Palin , the populist ex-governor of Alaska who was the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 2008 .  " Are you ready to stump for Trump ? " Ms Palin asked cheering supporters at a campaign rally in Iowa .  She was John McCain 's running mate in 2008 before they lost to Barack Obama .  Despite retiring from politics in favour of a media career , she remains an influential conservative voice .  Officially announcing her endorsement , Ms Palin said Mr Trump was someone ready to let US troops " kick Isis ' ass " , using another name for the self-styled Islamic State group .  " We are ready for a change , " she told the rally in Ames , Iowa .  " He ( Trump ) is beholden to no one but ' we , the people ' . He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again . "  The New York businessman , who leads the Republican race , said in backing .  Ms Palin was a " trusted conservative " with a " proven record of being fiscally modest , staunchly pro-life and she believes in small government that allows businesses to grow and freedom to prosper " , the statement added .  While the former Alaska governor 's reputation has been diminished since the heady days of 2008 - thanks to her absence from public office and involvement in series of questionable reality television shows - she is still well liked by conservative Republicans and nearly universally known .  Her backing could help insulate Mr Trump against charges that he 's not a true believer in the cause due to his support for liberal political issues and candidates in the past .  At the very least , she could add even more crowd-drawing power to a Trump campaign that already fills entire sports arenas .  Mrs Palin was just two years into her Alaskan governorship when she was picked by John McCain to be his running mate .
