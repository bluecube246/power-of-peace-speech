donald trump 's republican presidential bid has received the backing of sarah palin , the populist ex-governor of alaska who was the republican vice-presidential candidate in 2008 .  " are you ready to stump for trump ? " ms palin asked cheering supporters at a campaign rally in iowa .  she was john mccain 's running mate in 2008 before they lost to barack obama .  despite retiring from politics in favour of a media career , she remains an influential conservative voice .  officially announcing her endorsement , ms palin said mr trump was someone ready to let us troops " kick isis ' ass " , using another name for the self-styled islamic state group .  " we are ready for a change , " she told the rally in ames , iowa .  " he ( trump ) is beholden to no one but ' we , the people ' . he is perfectly positioned to let you make america great again . "  the new york businessman , who leads the republican race , said in backing .  ms palin was a " trusted conservative " with a " proven record of being fiscally modest , staunchly pro-life and she believes in small government that allows businesses to grow and freedom to prosper " , the statement added .  while the former alaska governor 's reputation has been diminished since the heady days of 2008 - thanks to her absence from public office and involvement in series of questionable reality television shows - she is still well liked by conservative republicans and nearly universally known .  her backing could help insulate mr trump against charges that he 's not a true believer in the cause due to his support for liberal political issues and candidates in the past .  at the very least , she could add even more crowd-drawing power to a trump campaign that already fills entire sports arenas .  mrs palin was just two years into her alaskan governorship when she was picked by john mccain to be his running mate .
