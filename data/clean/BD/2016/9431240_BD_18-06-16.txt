<p> The year 2016 marks the beginning of the SDGs and developing countries are grappling with how to implement them . Bangladesh with the world has moved to SDGs from MDGs in the year . <p> Unlike the MDGs , which were drawn solely by the United Nations , the new universal goals were arrived at in September last year after more than two years of thorough consultation with global leaders , civil society groups and other stakeholders around the world . <p> While the MDGs which had come into effect in 2000 focused on the social and economic aspects of development by 2015 , the SDGs go much further by addressing the causes of poverty , improving all areas of all people 's life by 2030 , and with a slogan of " Leave no one behind . " <p> Over the next 15 years , the global development agenda will be preoccupied with the ambitious challenge of achieving 17 SDGs with 169 targets for the developed and developing countries .
