in the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2016-17 , the government has proposed to increase tax at source to 1.5% from 0.60% .  " it has become a tradition for the government to increase tax at source in every budget , but i think that there should be a certain rate for a certain period , " bgmea president siddiqur rahman told the press conference .  " textile and rmg sector would be the worst victim of the proposed tax at source . in the proposed budget for the next fiscal , tax at source increased to 1.5% from 0.60% , a 150% rise , for all export oriented-sectors , which will hinder the growth of the sectors , " he stated .  on the other hand , rahman said : " the government has set 7.2% gdp growth for the next fiscal , which is conflicting with government 's labor intensive industrial policy as 25% contribution comes from the manufacturing sector . "  as the production cost has been increased by 8% to 10% due to the compliance issues , the 30% to 35% . considering all the aspects , most of the rmg factories would not be able to survive , he added .  " the government has increased its revenue earning target indiscriminately without considering the consequence on the overall investment , " said fbcci first vice president shafiul islam mohiuddin who also stressed on enhancing revenues collection through industrialisation .  he said : " the budget proposal should not be a burden for the investors , which will discourage the investment , a tool for creating new jobs . "  the proposed budget has increased tax on chemicals from 3% to 5% , which will ultimately discourage the investments , said ah aslam sunny , first vice president of bkmea .  in september last year , the government had hiked prices of gas by 100% and it has increased tax at source to 1.5% . now the question is whether the government really wants industrialisation or not , said md fazlul hoque , vice president of btma .  " if the government continues to impose tax burden one after another on the industry people , " he questioned .
