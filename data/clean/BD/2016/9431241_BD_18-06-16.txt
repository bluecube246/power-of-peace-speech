<p> In the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2016-17 , the government has proposed to increase tax at source to 1.5% from 0.60% . <p> " It has become a tradition for the government to increase tax at source in every budget , but I think that there should be a certain rate for a certain period , " BGMEA President Siddiqur Rahman told the press conference . <p> " Textile and RMG sector would be the worst victim of the proposed tax at source . In the proposed budget for the next fiscal , tax at source increased to 1.5% from 0.60% , a 150% rise , for all export oriented-sectors , which will hinder the growth of the sectors , " he stated . <p> On the other hand , Rahman said : " The government has set 7.2% GDP growth for the next fiscal , which is conflicting with government 's labor intensive industrial policy as 25% contribution comes from the manufacturing sector . " <p> As the production cost has been increased by 8% to 10% due to the compliance issues , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30% to 35% . Considering all the aspects , most of the RMG factories would not be able to survive , he added . <p> " The government has increased its revenue earning target indiscriminately without considering the consequence on the overall investment , " said FBCCI First Vice President Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin who also stressed on enhancing revenues collection through industrialisation . <p> He said : " The budget proposal should not be a burden for the investors , which will discourage the investment , a tool for creating new jobs . " <p> The proposed budget has increased tax on chemicals from 3% to 5% , which will ultimately discourage the investments , said AH Aslam Sunny , first vice president of BKMEA . <p> In September last year , the government had hiked prices of gas by 100% and it has increased tax at source to 1.5% . Now the question is whether the government really wants industrialisation or not , said Md Fazlul Hoque , vice president of BTMA . <p> " If the government continues to impose tax burden one after another on the industry people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he questioned .
