being a father means being there for your child  royena and mamun had a small family of two . one day , there arrived a little angel who they named tia . the parents were nervous .  how would they take care of a baby ? they did n't have anyone to teach them parenting , and they did n't have an extra pair of hands to help them out with housework .  after thinking for a while , royena and mamun decided to do all the work by themselves . they started to sort out their tasks one by one .  mamun took a month 's leave from his work for his beloved tia , and to make some scope for royena to have few days of proper sleep , and a bit of leisure .  he always intended to wrap tia with the warm love of a father . royena also constantly made herself busy with all the necessary and unnecessary things related to tia . cooking and other household chores were usually divided equally among themselves .  mamun they could n't care less .  mamun might sound like a fictional character , but every family would do well to have a dad like him . it 's been tradition to bring pregnant mothers to their paternal houses right before childbirth . the reasoning being that it is important to take an experienced person 's advice when it comes to parenting .  however , in our society , parents often forget another equally important issue : creating a bond between father and child .  staying away from the dad for an extended period of time makes children dependent only on their moms , and in the future , they may face difficulties to get rid of that dependency .  think a bit . when these new moms go back to their own nuclear families and think of joining work , they have to face huge problems , because their child has simply not spent enough time with his or her father .  this may cause moms to devote themselves to 24/7 child-rearing on top of their office work .  this is a mental breakdown difficult job , a lot of moms leave their careers for that . that often makes them depressed . the dad 's role is very significant , because only a mature and mentally capable partner can relieve the mother from her anxiety .  there are no gender roles when it comes to parenting . it is well past time for society to understand that child-rearing is not just a mother 's job .  by nature , children are dependent on moms for certain things . however , most things can be provided by the father .  fathers can bathe the children , feed them , make them sleep , and look after them when mommy is tired .  dads often do n't face the challenges of child-rearing because of social norms . but dads need to ask themselves : when the mom suffers from overwork and lack of sleep and fails to take proper care of the children , who will be the ultimate sufferer ? the children , and the father himself .  dads -- whatever your mothers , aunts , or in-laws may say beside the new moms . it 's your responsibility to do so . nowadays , many offices grant paternity leave .  in that time , you can spend some precious time with your newborn , and your partner . if your wife is staying with your parents , visit them often . do n't just be a visitor . be a dad .  many partners have a tendency to take the paternal leave and spend it on themselves . this brings dissatisfaction to their partners .  the elders of the family have an important role to play . dads should n't be away , but close to their babies .  in nuclear families , when moms get busy with other household chores , if dads are there to take care of the children for a while , moms would get a chance to catch their breath .  remember : children will not be scared of dads anymore , but run towards them with a smile . giving children money or only providing food is not the only role dads need to live up to .  walk them through the ups and downs of life .  dads -- if you do n't involve yourselves in the lives of your children , one day your child might ask their mother who the strange man in the house is.
