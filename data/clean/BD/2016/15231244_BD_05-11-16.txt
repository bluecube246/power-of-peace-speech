Canadian unemployment sticks at 7 pc despite 44,000 new jobs  OTTAWA(Canada) : Canada created 44,000 jobs in October , according to the country 's Labor Force Survey released Friday -- more than expected but not enough to reduce the seven percent unemployment rate .  Economists had anticipated the unemployment rate would remain stable for a third consecutive month , predicting job growth of just 3,000 posts .  The thousands of new jobs resulted from " more part-time work " and an overall increase in the number of people active in the labor market , the national statistical agency said .  More than half the new jobs , all part-time , went to young people aged 15 to 24 . Most of the new posts were in the private sector , with a modest rise in public-sector employment .  Canadian economic growth has been slowly recovering since summer 's end . The second quarter saw the gross domestic product drop after massive wildfires raged throughout western Alberta 's oil-sands region of Fort McMurray in May .  Employment in the natural resources industry notable increase since March 2015 ? -- mostly in Alberta .  Employment in Ontario , the most populous province , grew most significantly with 25,000 more jobs , helping unemployment there fall to 6.4 percent .  Across the country , most job increases came from construction and wholesale and retail trade , with declines in business services and the hotel industry .
