FEU shakes off UP in V-League  Early quarterfinalist Far Eastern University ( FEU ) repulsed a pesky University of the Philippines ( UP ) side as it hacked out a 27-25 , 25-22 , 18-25 , 23-25 , 15-8 victory yesterday to stay unscathed in the Shakey 's V-League Season 13 Collegiate Conference at The Arena in San Juan City .  The Lady Tams raced to a 4-0 start to dictate the game tempo in the fifth set and went on to deliver the needed attacks to sweep the Group B preliminaries with a 4-0 win-loss record heading to the six-team carryover next phase .  UP , which also booked a quarterfinals berth early this week , finished with a 3-1 card .  Indeed , the Lady Tams displayed their never-say-die attitude as they rallied from 10-19 and 20-24 deficits to clinch the opening set .  FEU held the momentum until the end of the second frame , but UP fought back in the next two to extend into a decider .  But the Lady Tams proved tougher with Toni Rose smashed 22 kills to finish 24 points for FEU , while Palma added 15 points built on two blocks and two aces .  Meanwhile , defending champion Ateneo made short work of University of Santo Tomas ( UST ) with a 25-16 , 25-15 , 25-21 victory yesterday to secure the first semifinal berth in the Spikers ' Turf Season 2 Collegiate Conference .  The Eagles needed only 62 minutes in disposing of the Tigers to remain the only unbeaten team in Group B with a 4-0 win-loss slate .
