<h> ' Weeks ' to identify Brussels blast victims <p> People pay tribute to the victims of the Brussels attacks on March 24 , 2016 on place de la Bourse in Brussels , two days after the suicide bombing attacks of terrorists on March 22 in Zaventem airport and Brussels subway Maelbeek -- Maalbeek that killed 31 and injured 300 people . / AFP / PATRIK STOLLARZ <p> Working with teeth , fingerprints and DNA , and sometimes relying on just tiny body parts , the forensic experts dealing with the victims of the Brussels attacks warn it could take weeks to identify them . <p> In a large military hospital complex in a leafy district north of Brussels , the experts are at work to establish the identities of corpses that have in many cases been left missing body parts by the blasts . <p> Guarded by heavily armed men in combat gear , the Reine Astrid hospital is being used as Belgium 's missing persons centre , or Disaster Victim Identification ( DVI ) unit . <p> The painstaking nature of the work means families from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final confirmation that their loved ones were among the 31 people killed . <p> " Yesterday we had around 30 people here looking for family , " Ine Van Wymersch , who runs the centre , told AFP . " None of the bodies has yet been formally identified , the process is ongoing . " <p> Doctors , police , psychologists and Red Cross personnel are on hand to help people seeking news of missing relatives . <p> Nearly three days on , none of the bodies brought from the airport and train disaster scenes to the morgue has yet been formally identified and the process could take many more weeks . <p> Only once they have been identified will relatives be able to take the bodies away for funerals . <p> " The number of non-identified people is very , very exceptional , " federal police spokesman Michael Jonnois told AFP . <p> " It was an ' open ' catastrophe , there was no list of who was in the train or at the airport terminal -- there was no passenger list like when there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty damage ' <p> Jonnois said forensics experts collect wallets and jewellery and check details such as weight , height and hair colour with relatives . <p> " We want to have 100 percent certainty . We can not allow ourselves to have the slightest doubt . " <p> But with victims believed to come from up to 40 different countries , Philippe Boxho , head of the Liege university forensics department , says Interpol help may be needed and the process may be long . <p> " They 'll be identified by their teeth , their DNA or their fingerprints -- in that order , " he said . <p> " Teeth are quick , DNA takes a while longer and finger-prints only work if they 're already on file -- though sometimes you can recover prints from their homes or workplaces . " <p> Dental checks could be carried out with help from dentists , DNA recovered by asking relatives to bring toothbrushes or other items , he said . <p> But this is more easily said than done when there is little or no means of identification and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months to get DNA from a woman who lived in Berlin but who we first had to find , " he said . <p> Identification would likely be extremely difficult in the case of the Brussels attacks , he said , due to the violence of the three blasts , in which the Islamic State attackers used TATP high explosive packed with nails . <p> At the epicentre of an explosion , bodies " are completely destroyed , in tiny pieces , and at the periphery you find bodies that are more or less intact , missing body parts " . <p> " In this case there is probably some very heavy-duty damage , " Boxho said . <p> He said scientific identification was key to avoiding problems of mistaken identity , as asking family to identify victims visually was both psychologically difficult and unreliable . <p> " Some people are ready to recognise any corpse while others will refuse to , even if it 's the right one , " he said .
