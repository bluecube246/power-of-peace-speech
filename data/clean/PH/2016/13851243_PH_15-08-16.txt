<p> THE SINGER , who had knee replacement surgery , joked about other senior artists . Photo courtesy of MONG Pintolo for Ovation Productions <p> " I May look fragile , but should I fall , do n't bother helping me , " the American singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers jested from a stool on which he spent much of his one-night concert in Manila last Thursday . " I have this thing called Life Alert -- all I need to do is press a button . " <p> The pop-country crossover artist , who turns 78 this month , has had knee replacement surgery that rendered him practically immobile onstage . <p> He performed most of his songs sitting down , only standing up when he has seemingly mustered enough strength . And when he tried to move about , he did so with a limping shuffle . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " I think they replaced the wrong knee , " quipped Rogers , who poked fun at his predicament every once in a while , as if assuring the packed crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things he complained about his body were deemed " age-appropriate " by doctors , he said . So it was rather disheartening , he confessed , when he saw The Rolling Stones ' Mick Jagger -- " who must have been 101 or 102 " -- dancing like he was 15 at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival . <p> Later on , he found out that Willie Nelson , who 's four years his senior , has gotten a black belt in a Korean martial art . " The only way I could make sense of everything is to accept the fact that I did n't do enough drugs in the ' 60s ! " Rogers said , prompting a hearty round of chuckles from the fans . <p> However , it was n't only his mobility -- or lack thereof -- that proved to be a struggle . His voice , especially early in the show , was barely audible . <p> He was usually winded ; the tone he produced , quite gravelly . And on the rare moments he attempted to sustain a note , his voice wavered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " It 's Only a Paper Moon , " " Daytime Lovers " and " Anyone Who Is n't Me , " Rogers let his night 's special guest , the delightfully bubbly country singer Linda Davis , steer the ship . <p> Between songs , Rogers relied on his gift of gab ; he kept the fans tuned in with funny anecdotes from his 60 years in the business . <p> Talking about The Scholars , a band he played guitar for during his teenage years , he said , " It 's funny because we were all straight-D students ! " <p> But in spite of his diminished physicality and singing abilities , there was one thing that remained unweathered : the magic of his music . <p> Other crowd-pleasers were " Lucille " -- the song that " changed " Rogers ' life -- and " We 've Got Tonight , " a duet with Sheena Easton . At times , Rogers passed the singing duties to the fans , and they were more than happy to take over . <p> While a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained tunes that easily evoked nostalgia -- " Lady , " " We Are the World , " " Islands in the Stream . " <p> In " Heroes , " a song from a theater musical he penned , " The Toy Shoppe , " Rogers summoned every ounce of what 's left of his once-sturdy vocals to deliver his most stable , tender and heartfelt performance . <p> An equally poignant moment was Rogers ' delivery of " You Are So Beautiful , " which he dedicated to his twin sons with his fifth wife . <p> The show , mounted by Ovation Productions , was part of his preretirement world tour named after the song , " The Gambler , " whose lyrics go , " You 've got to know when to hold ' em/ Know when to fold ' em/ Know when to walk away . " <p> And as far as farewells go , this concert was bittersweet : The Rogers the Filipino crowd saw -- in his first and last outing here -- was far from the strapping , swaying and guitar-toting black-bearded man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his devoted fans , seeing the music icon in the flesh before he hangs up his boots was a privilege .
