<p> CAGAYAN DE ORO - Having a United States military facility in Cagayan de Oro City will bring with it a host of problems , including increased incidence of prostitution , sexually transmitted diseases like HIV and AIDS , as well as abandoned children , the women 's group Gabriela said . <p> With the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement ( EDCA ) between the United States and the Philippines last January , a US military facility will soon be set up in the city 's old airport facility . <p> Rhodora Bulosan , Gabriela spokesperson of Northern Mindanao Region ( NMR ) , issued the warning Tuesday at the 105th year commemoration of International Women 's Day . <p> " We should learn from our past . Cagayan de Oro City does not deserve a repeat from what happened in Clark and Subic bases . Prostitution and abuses were rampant while the US base enjoyed tax holidays and impunity over cases of rights violations especially on women and children , " said Bulosan . <p> " American servicemen abandoned around 60,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegitimate affairs without any consideration of the children 's welfare , " she added . <p> " More children would be born under such conditions , giving rise to the number of street children abandoned by their fathers , " the Gabriela spokesperson said . <p> Bulosan also expressed her concern over the rise of sexually transmitted diseases such as the HIV-AIDS . <p> " This city ranks number two in the country on cases of people with HIV or AIDS , " she said . <p> " In the first quarter of 2016 alone , there were two rape cases involving young women in the city . Our group fears that the situation will aggravate should the American military facility starts to operate in Lumbia , " she said . <p> EDCA allows the US to build structures ; station troops ; store and pre-position weapons , defense supplies and material ; assign civilian personnel and defense contractors ; and transit and station vehicles , vessels , and aircraft for a period of 10 years . <p> The Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) provided a short list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list included Nueva Ecija , Clark , Palawan , Cebu , and Cagayan de Oro .
