Iraqi Army on the verge of liberating key ISIS stronghold  One day after seizing four villages along the main road from Baghdad to Mosul , the Iraqi Armed Forces have advanced to the fringes of the key Islamic State stronghold in the Nineveh Governorate .  According to a military source in the area , the Islamic State terrorists have abandoned their first line of defense and retreated north towards Al-Qiyyarah 's town-center .  Should the Iraqi Armed Forces seize this key town in southern Nineveh , they will be in position to push deeper in the Mosul District , which has been under the Islamic State 's control for over two years .  Meanwhile , in the Khazir Region of Mosul , the Kurdish Peshmerga forces are making their own push towards Mosul , capturing several sites along the highway that stretches from Iraqi Kurdistan to the provincial capital of the Nineveh Governorate.
