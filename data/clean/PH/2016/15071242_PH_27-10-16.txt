"  the report of the minority bloc , led by quezon representative danilo suarez , said a congressional recommendation by congress is only consistent with the principles of separation of powers , and check and balance in government .  " unfortunately 14 , missed the opportunity to discharge the congressional sense of public accountability in the case of a public official embroiled in the drug trafficking scandal at the national penitentiary -- sen. leila de lima -- when it failed to recommend prosecution for her grave misdeeds in the discharge of her functions as secretary of justice , " it said .  in a news conference , suarez said the testimonies of the witnesses , mostly high profile inmates at bilibid , were enough evidence to prove de lima 's culpability .  " what evidence are we still talking about ? everything has been said there , " suarez said .  kabayan partylist rep. harry roque , a member of the minority , pointed out that the past inquiries conducted by the senate blue ribbon committee , such as on the issue of the fertilizer fund scam and nbn-zte deal , all came up with recommendations to prosecute officials .  " this is the first time i am seeing an investigation without recommendation ( to prosecute ) , " he said .  ako bicol partylist rep. rodel in the same news conference that the criminal liability should be determined by the courts , not congress .  " there is a danger when congress starts identifying the charges against officials because we are not all lawyers here , " batocabe said .  in its report , the minority bloc said that , by making the recommendation , congress expresses its " deep indignation over the hideous facts unearthed in the course of its inquiry in aid of legislation . "  " congress can not close its eyes to the depth of depravity it had just uncovered at the nbp in the course of its legislative investigation , " it said .  " the affidavits by several witnesses presented before the committee on justice are , in the view of the minority , sufficient to justify the filing of criminal charges against her , " it added .  by refusing to recommend de lima 's prosecution , the minority said that the justice panel had put weeks of hearings " to waste , without resolving a problem that clearly exists in society , whether or horrendous scandal at the national penitentiary . "  the minority argued said de lima may be prosecuted for the following crimes or offenses :  violation of section 8 and section 27 of republic act 9165 or the comprehensive dangerous drugs act of 2002 .  violation of section 7(d) of republic act 6713 or the code of conduct and ethical standards for public officials and employees .  violation of section 8 of republic act 3019 or the anti-graft and corrupt practices act .
