" The Volleyball Season Kick-Off is a way of letting the volleybelles relax and have fun with their teammates and fans before the upcoming season opening , " said PLDT VP and HOME Marketing Director Gary Dujali .  " Promoting sports excellence has always been part of our advocacy , from when we presented the 2015 Shakey 's V-League Conferences which hailed the Ultera Ultra-Fast Hitters as back-to-back champions , to now , as we present UAAP Women 's Volleyball Season 78 . "  After rounds of questions involving general knowledge , Pinoy family facts , Internet movies and TV ( from iflix , Fox and Pinoyflix ) , Pinoy love teams , online fame and volleyball , the Adamson University team came out on top , granting the volleyball stars P25,000 to purchase new volleyball equipment and donate to their chosen volleyball organization , and entitling the fans to complete round one passes to the UAAP Women 's Volleyball Season 78
