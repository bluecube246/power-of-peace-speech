Usable Green Features benefit community and home owners  Apr 3 , 2016  by PR  Many residential developments these days like to tout their ecologically-friendly , or ' green features ' as helping combat climate change , complete with certificates from international certifying bodies to boot .  But Filinvest One Oasis Cagayan de Oro would rather focus on eco-friendly features that actually benefit home owners ( and not merely serve as marketing attractions for developers ) and even the community around them .  Materials Recovery Facility of One Oasis Bali Bldg 1  Take its Materials Recovery Facility ( MRF ) , for instance . Republic Act # 9003 ( Ecological Waste Management Act of 2000 ) defines MRF as a facility designed to efficiently sort and store recyclable materials ( paper , tins , glass , plastic and the like ) in an environmentally sound manner . The Environment Management Bureau ( EMB ) aims to set up one in every community in response to the mounting solid waste problem in the country . As a community by itself , One Oasis do-able approach which is not merely environmentally friendly , but makes good business sense . It segregates waste materials for disposal and those which are re-usable for resale or recycling , encouraging home owners to participate in keeping their community clean and sanitary .  Its MRF receives biodegradable waste for composting and mixed non-biodegradable wastes for final segregation , re-use and recycling , with each type of mixed waste collected from the source and transported to the MRF in separate containers .  This sorting strategy has proven to be effective in most communities that have established MRFs , as they have maintained a clean environment , as well as initiating business opportunities for buying and selling re-usable and recyclable materials . Not only is the mounting problem of uncollected garbage addressed , other related issues such as the unpleasant odors which have plagued a number of subdivisions in the city , are also eliminated .  Additional eco-friendly features of One Oasis Cagayan de Oro include its sewage treatment plant ( STP ) and underground detention pond . The STP processes waste water and other effluents into safe , a drainage system which collects rain water in a detention pond serves as a flood-control measure when rainfall is heavy.When an area like the One Oasis CDO community is paved , or covered with buildings , water runs off the property much faster than when it is in its natural state . The total amount of discharge is the same , but the discharge happens over a shorter amount of time as the detention pond temporarily detains the water and keeps the runoff to the desired rate . When the rain ends , water stored at the detention pond will be emptied shortly afterwards to another outlet leading to the river or sea , or stored underground for re-use and recycling . More importantly , impounded water can be recycled for non-potable use such as irrigating the community 's green areas .  The whole One Oasis Cagayan de Oro complex which will eventually house some 1,300 units in five condominium buildings shall benefit from these features .  Each condominium building in One Oasis CDO will have seven to eight floors of residential units and a roof deck cum laundry located stairways , connecting all levels .  Each 2 bedroom and 1 bedroom residential unit comes with a balcony and laundry cage for drying . Parking slots for residents are available for sale on a first come , first served basis .
