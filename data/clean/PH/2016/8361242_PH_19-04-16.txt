Civility in our politics

civility in our politics  it was searing hot in the entire country the past days . the philippine atmospheric , geophysical and astronomical services administration ( pagasa ) reported that the heat index reached almost 42 degrees celsius in metro manila and a blistering 52 degrees in cabanatuan city .  the sweltering heat is matched only by the increasingly fiery rhetoric that has characterized the presidential campaign as we approach the may 2016 elections . the most recent surveys show that despite davao city mayor rodrigo duterte pole-vaulting into the lead , the race for malaca ? ang is essentially a neck-and-neck race .  the duterte camp has every reason to celebrate . duterte 's message seems to be resonating to a frustrated filipino public who appreciate his straightforward manner .  it is important to remember , however , that this race has been rollercoaster from the beginning . we started out with vice president jejomar binay firmly in control .  in fact , many thought that the 2016 elections would be a return bout between the vice president and the person then a flurry of corruption accusations , mainly hurled during the senate hearings , pulled down binay 's numbers . it was at this point that senator grace poe , who topped the 2013 senatorial elections , wrestled the lead .  after president benigno aquino iii officially endorsed his secretary of interior and local government , mar 's number went up , with at least one poll showing him in number two position .  late last year , binay surprised analysts when he reclaimed the lead in the last two surveys in december . and now , the tough-talking duterte is currently the leader . will he lead the race until may 9 ? that remains to be seen .  but recently , the rhetoric of the campaign has become nasty . the second commission on elections ( comelec ) -sponsored debate proved to be very entertaining because of the sniping and verbal tussles between the candidates .  in the past few days , we have seen media inundated with accusations and imputations of impropriety and even threats of jail for the other candidate . it 's .  i am , of course , very familiar with this brand of politics , having been a target of one in the 2010 polls . my readers will recall that false accusations were hurled against me by my opponents attacking my person and my family .  i was accused of being a supporter of former president gloria arroyo despite the fact that i was never an ally of gma , and that as senate president i supported investigations against gma .  people questioned the life story of my family by alleging that we were never poor . my accusers offer as proof recent pictures of the place where we lived before proclaiming that it was a not an impoverished village .  well , of course ! they took those pictures at a time when the area has already improved ! but during the time when we lived there , it was a poor neighborhood .  my readers may also remember the so-called " opulent mansion " in salt lake city , utah which i allegedly owned . simple research revealed that it was a hoax my opponents in politics .  despite these false and vicious attacks against me , i never sanctioned any black propaganda activities against another candidate . not even when it was becoming increasingly clear that we can not win the 2010 polls .  during my years in public service , i have always believed that political contests do not have to be a mudslinging fight . we may have opposing views but it does not mean we can not see eye to eye . we may disagree on certain issues but it does not mean we need to be disagreeable .  i think that all presidentiables for the 2016 elections are honorable men and women . for this reason , i hope that we can focus on the real debate in the remaining days before our people go to the polls .  i am confident that the candidates do not need to take personal shots at one another in order to win . i am hopeful that the next debate in pangasinan would focus on providing answers to our nation 's problems rather that attacking one another . ensure that the public will witness a thoughtful conversation among our leaders rather than a confrontation .  the oxford dictionaries define civility as " politeness and courtesy in behavior and speech . " i hope the presidential hopefuls can rise above partisan politics and become role models in bringing back civility on our political discourse .  we need to remember that the electoral campaign season is not just about the candidates but it is also a venue to teach young filipinos about our politics and government . elections are vehicles for political socialization .  is it difficult to be polite to each other ? my late mother , nanay curing , taught me this invaluable lesson : respect others . it never occurred to me that i needed to disrespect another person in order to advance my cause .  in business , politeness and decorum are also essential . even in the middle of intense business competition , i believe that courtesy to others actually create conducive atmosphere for constructive dialog .  let us discuss the problems of the nation and the answers being offered by to how to solve our problems but let us not question each other 's motives .
