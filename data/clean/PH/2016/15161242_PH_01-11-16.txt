ATLANTA -- Forget about Dwight Howard 's trouble at the line and Atlanta 's off night from the field . The Hawks settled down in time to secure their first 3-0 start in five seasons .  Howard had 18 points and Kyle Korver and Dennis Schroder scored 17 apiece , leading Atlanta to a 106-95 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Monday .  Every Atlanta starter scored in double figures , and the Hawks held Sacramento 's DeMarcus Cousins in check after he averaged 30 points in the Kings ' first three games . He finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds .  The Kings scored 37 points in the third on their way to an 81-79 lead heading into the final period . But the Hawks closed with a flourish .  " Third quarter we did n't keep our composure , fourth quarter we did , " Atlanta forward Paul Millsap said . " That team wants to make the game ugly . If you get caught up into that , then you 'll have a 37-point quarter , and we got for 20 from the line , but also contributed 11 rebounds and four blocked shots . Millsap had 13 points and a game-high 14 rebounds .  The Kings were whistled for 34 fouls , and the Hawks went 29 for 47 at the line overall .  Sacramento led 83-81 in the fourth quarter when Millsap made a foul shot and Kent Bazemore connected on a 3 to give the Hawks the lead . Korver helped Atlanta hold on with another 3 with about four minutes left .  The Kings made just 6 of 18 shots in the final period .  " Where it ran back away from us was we fell in love with the jump shot , and stopped getting in the paint , " Sacramento coach Dave Joerger .  Millsap helped with the defense on Cousins , and also finished with eight assists , three steals and a blocked shot .  In Toronto , DeMar DeRozan fired 33 points while Kyle Lowry made a couple key baskets late to finish with 29 points , helping the Raptors beat the Denver Nuggets , 105-102.
