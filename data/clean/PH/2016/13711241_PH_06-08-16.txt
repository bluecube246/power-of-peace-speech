manchester united 's new portuguese manager jose mourinho poses with a football shirt on the pitch at old trafford stadium in manchester , northern england , on july 5 , 2016 . jose mourinho officially started work as manchester united manager at the club 's carrington training base yesterday . the 53-year-old was appointed as united boss in may after the sacking of dutchman louis van gaal. / afp / oli scarff ( photo credit should read oli scarff/afp/getty images )  mourinho in ' makes hypocritical statement ' shocker  jose mourinho addressed the press on friday looking more like someone who had been down the pub all day than a football manager and he had some typically idiotic things to say .  the manchester united boss hinted that the club 's newest signing will happen soon and anyone with half a brain cell knows this signing is juventus ' paul progba . the deal is reported to be worth around ? 100m . ridiculous money and an amount that numerous managers , not just arsene wenger and jurgen klopp , have criticised .  pesky things called ' facts ' get in the way .  " i only speak about us , " jose said , desperately trying to push his lengthening nose back in .  " i heard already two of my colleagues from other clubs speaking about us . i do not like that . it is not ethical . "  for starters , not only is the former chelsea manager ignoring the fact that numerous managers the world over think that paying that amount of money for anyone is foolish , he 's also being a huge hypocrite considering he previously slammed the red devils for the wages they pay luke shaw .  " if we pay to a 19-year-old boy what we were being asked for , to sign luke shaw , we are dead , " he said , back in 2014 .  " we would have killed our stability with financial fair play and killed the stability in our dressing room .  " because when you pay that much to a 19-year-old kid -- a good player , fantastic player -- but when , we would have had players knocking on our door .  " they would have been saying , ' how is it possible i play 200 games for this club , won this and that , yet a 19-year-old comes here and gets more money than i get ? '  " it would 've killed immediately our balance and we could n't allow that . i do n't criticise another club for paying it . they can pay what they want . i do n't have any comment about it . but for my club we can say it would be very negative for us , especially when we can say felipe is much less expensive . sometimes you have to make decisions . "  i challenge anyone to argue that jose mourinho does not talk about other clubs and managers ... is n't that all he does ?  matthew , stephen and mosope get together at the midnight hour to discuss north american friendly fire , youth policies in the epl and all the signings ( clue : no new ones ) . while battling to , download , subscribe in itunes ( or all other podcast apps ) , or get it early on ...
