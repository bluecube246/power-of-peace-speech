MANILA - Police authorities out to arrest a Chinese national for suspected drug offenses stumbled on an allegedly illegal online gambling operation with 60 foreigners - 51 of them Chinese - as employees , mostly bearing only tourist visas when they entered the country .  The National Capital Regional Police Office ( NCRPO ) on Thursday said the 60 aliens were arrested during an anti-illegal drug operations Wednesday night in Makati City .  In a statement , NCRPO said operatives of the Regional Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Task Group ( RAIDSOTG ) swooped down on a 15th Floor unit at a building along Ayala Avenue , Makati City .  Among those arrested in the operation was the police 's original target , Chinese national " Zang Hai Long " and 41 others .  The NCRPO said all those arrested had only tourist visas and no other documents .  They only have a certification for an interactive gaming support service , according to Senior Supt. Eleaszar Matta , RAID-SOTG chief .  Probers are looking into the possibility the employees there may have been the office 's 24/7 online gaming operation .  Police have been monitoring the establishment and a case build-up was already being conducted after some Chinese reportedly spilled the beans on the illegal operations , said NCRPO Director , Chief Supt. Oscar Albayalde .  " This has been under surveillance for a long time and some Chinese also squealed on them . It seems that this is not legal and this is a big online gaming and it does n't have any license and its license is not for online gaming , " Albayalde said .  The NCRPO will coordinate with the Bureau of Immigration to verify the records of the 51 foreigners nabbed in the raid , he added .
