Sorry or not : Duterte keeps people guessing  Metro Manila ( CNN Philippines ) -- The swashbuckling mayor of Davao City had the people confused again on Tuesday ( April 19 ) over his stance -- this time , about a recent rape comment that drew flak and attention in and out of the country .  The confusion stemmed from conflicting statements from Rodrigo Duterte 's camp and Duterte himself .  But the 71-year-old mayor made it clear : he is not apologizing for the joke that caught international ire and attention .  Last year , Duterte 's remark also sowed confusion when he hurled invectives at Pope Francis over the mammoth traffic jam that the papal visit had caused . The statement drew flak , prompting him to say that he did not direct his cursing at the pope but it was aimed at the hellish gridlock.
