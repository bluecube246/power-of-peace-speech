sorry or not : duterte keeps people guessing  metro manila ( cnn philippines ) -- the swashbuckling mayor of davao city had the people confused again on tuesday ( april 19 ) over his stance -- this time , about a recent rape comment that drew flak and attention in and out of the country .  the confusion stemmed from conflicting statements from rodrigo duterte 's camp and duterte himself .  but the 71-year-old mayor made it clear : he is not apologizing for the joke that caught international ire and attention .  last year , duterte 's remark also sowed confusion when he hurled invectives at pope francis over the mammoth traffic jam that the papal visit had caused . the statement drew flak , prompting him to say that he did not direct his cursing at the pope but it was aimed at the hellish gridlock.
