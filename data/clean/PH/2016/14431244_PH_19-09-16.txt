Terabit-speed fiber optic technology is far from mature for commercial use , but recent tests have moved it a step closer . Image INQUIRER.net  While researchers have been developing terabit speed fiber optics technology for several years , it has yet to approach a maturity that will make it viable for commercial use . The latest field test , however , shows promise that commercially ready terabit speed fiber optic data connections may not be far off .  A recent field test conducted by Nokia Bell Labs , Deutsch Telekom and the Technical University of Munich displayed 1Tbps data transmission speeds under " real conditions " where channel conditions and traffic were varied , Engadget reports .  The feat was achieved using a new modulation technique called Probabilistic Constellation Shaping . It works by having the system prefer networking constellation points that have lower amplitudes and are less susceptible to noise as opposed to the typical fiber method of using all points . This new modulation technique thereby allows for transmissions to reach up to 30% as the system adapts the transmission rate to near the theoretical peak data speeds for fiber optic connections .

It will still take some time before all the bugs can be ironed out and the technology viable for commercial use . And with 5G cellular data just around the corner , the wired backbone of the internet is about to need even more bandwidth . Alfred Bayle
