terabit-speed fiber optic technology is far from mature for commercial use , but recent tests have moved it a step closer . image inquirer.net  while researchers have been developing terabit speed fiber optics technology for several years , it has yet to approach a maturity that will make it viable for commercial use . the latest field test , however , shows promise that commercially ready terabit speed fiber optic data connections may not be far off .  a recent field test conducted by nokia bell labs , deutsch telekom and the technical university of munich displayed 1tbps data transmission speeds under " real conditions " where channel conditions and traffic were varied , engadget reports .  the feat was achieved using a new modulation technique called probabilistic constellation shaping . it works by having the system prefer networking constellation points that have lower amplitudes and are less susceptible to noise as opposed to the typical fiber method of using all points . this new modulation technique thereby allows for transmissions to reach up to 30% as the system adapts the transmission rate to near the theoretical peak data speeds for fiber optic connections .  advertisement  fiber optic terabit technology may have taken a step forward but it is still by no means commercially ready . it will still take some time before all the bugs can be ironed out and the technology viable for commercial use . and with 5g cellular data just around the corner , the wired backbone of the internet is about to need even more bandwidth . alfred bayle
