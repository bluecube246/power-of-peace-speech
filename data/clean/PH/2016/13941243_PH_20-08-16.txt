Some of these tribes have been Islamized . A hodgepodge of migrants , local settlers , and Lumads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's population . <p> " Through the tribal games , we are able to strengthen the relationship of the different tribes residing in Davao City and dili na magkatinahaay ( not to be reluctant to deal with each other ) , " said Datu Rudy Mande of the Maitgsalog tribe . He helped organize the event with the Davao City Sports Development Office . He sees the Lumadnong Dula as an avenue to introduce their traditions to the non-lumads and to form friendships with other Lumads who are also participants . <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler <p> The Tribal Games , participated in enthusiastically by each lumad tribe , has the potential of being one of the highlights of the Kadayawan celebration .
