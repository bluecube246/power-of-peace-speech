Human resource management is key to establishing a safety culture in the company . By educating motorcyclists to become responsible drivers , businesses fulfill their social responsibility . By ensuring safety in our streets and workplaces , businesses gain profit as their messengers go about their duties without harming society and themselves . <p> Ana Liza " Pinky " Asis-Castro teaches corporate social responsibility and corporate governance at the Management and Organization Department of the Ramon V.
