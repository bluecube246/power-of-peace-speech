( AP Photo/Joshua Paul )  Montreal , Canada -- Two years on from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 , the UN 's aviation agency Tuesday announced new requirements in a bid to avoid a repeat of a mystery that has perplexed investigators .  The jet vanished on March 8 , 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew onboard , mostly Chinese and Malaysians , leaving distraught relatives still grasping for answers .  On the somber anniversary , the council of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) in Montreal adopted new transmit location information at least once a minute when in trouble , effectively providing real-time updates .  Other new measures , also brought in in response to the MH370 mystery , include extending the duration of cockpit voice recordings to 25 hours , considerably longer than the current norm .  The new requirements " will now greatly contribute to aviation 's ability to ensure that similar disappearances never occur again , " said Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu , president of the ICAO council .  The changes will take effect between now and 2021 .  Separately , the Malaysia-led international team of aviation experts set up to investigate the plane 's disappearance issued an annual progress report , but the brief statement had no new insights on what caused the jet to vanish .  Authorities believe the Boeing 777 detoured to the remote southern Indian Ocean and then plunged into the treacherous waters .  A wing fragment confirmed to be from MH370 was found on an island thousands of kilometers from the search area last year , the first proof that the plane indeed went down .
