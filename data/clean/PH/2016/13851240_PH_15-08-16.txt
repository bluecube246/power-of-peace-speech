Second stringer Luke Sese got his turn to shine with 19 points as he led three other mainstays in steering the Red Cubs to a 111-55 whipping of the San Sebastian Staglets .  Guilmer de la Torre , Aaron Fermin and Lars Sunga took turns in scoring big baskets and powered the Braves to a 90-64 quashing of the Emilio Aguinaldo College-ICA Brigadiers .  The Red Cubs and the Braves pulled off their ninth triumph in 10 games , allowing them to stay in contention for the Top 2 seats in the semis .  The Red Robins survived a close call with the Jose Rizal University Heavy Bombers , 81-79 , and they went on to claim their eighth win blasted the University of Perpetual Help Junior Altas , 95-80 . They were led by Troy Mallinlin topscoring for 24 points and combo guard Unique Naboa ekeing out 16 of his 23-point output in the first quarter .  Meanwhile , San Beda College Lions shoot to stay on top , while St. Benilde Blazers gun for their first victory as the two collide today .
