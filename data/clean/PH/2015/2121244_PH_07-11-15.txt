<h> Pit with 150 dead bodies shocks Mexican authorities <p> Mexico City -- A state human rights agency said Friday it is investigating why about 150 bodies of crime victims were dumped into pits in central Mexico . <p> Some of the bodies may have been buried in the mass graves simply to clean out a state morgue . But some of the bodies lacked the case file markers they are supposed to be buried with , leading to questions about how they died . <p> The grisly discovery in the central state of Morelos has raised questions about whether the case is another example of shoddy police work that denied families the right to recover the bodies of their loved ones , or something even more sinister . <p> The scandal began when detectives asked relatives of a kidnap victim killed in 2013 to keep his body for further testing . About a year later , the family of Oliver Wenceslao went to retrieve his body but were told it had already been sent to a common grave .
