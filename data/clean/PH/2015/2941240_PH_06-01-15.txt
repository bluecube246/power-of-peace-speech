january 6th , 2015 06:18 pm  sri lanka president mahinda rajapaksa addresses to supporters as he attends an election rally in the colombo suburb of piliyandala on january 5 . afp photo  colombo , sri lanka -- sri lanka 's president mahinda rajapaksa will face an unprecedented challenge from a newly galvanized opposition when he seeks reelection this week , five years after his crushing military victory over tamil guerrillas .  south asia 's longest-serving leader had appeared politically invincible after his forces crushed the tamil tigers in 2009 , ending a decades-long conflict and ushering in a new era of prosperity for the island nation .  rajapaksa won a landslide election victory in 2010 , but critics say the 69-year-old has failed to bring about reconciliation with sri lanka 's tamil minority in the years that followed .  advertisement  his second term has been dogged by accusations of corruption , including undermining the independence of the judiciary and lining the pockets of political cronies through lucrative contracts .  the surprise decision of his health minister maithripala sirisena to defect candidate has turned what might have been a walk-over into a real contest .  political commentator victor ivan said the low-profile sirisena had become a symbol of simmering discontent over corruption .  " he ( rajapaksa ) failed to ensure reconciliation , " ivan told afp .  " his focus was in mega-highways and ports . that was good for gdp growth , but not enough to heal a society wounded by decades of conflict . "  sri lanka 's economy has grown by an annual average of over seven percent since the war ended , partly thanks to hefty investment from close rajapaksa ally china .  but the opposition says chinese contractors have employed few local people , and household incomes have not kept pace with national growth rates .  opposition parties including the main tamil party have rallied behind sirisena , a 63-year-old farmer-turned-politician who is from the majority sinhalese community .  populist measures  while he still has support among sinhalese voters , rajapaksa is widely detested by members of the country 's biggest minority , who account for 13 percent bloc .  the president has taken drastic measures to shore up support , slashing fuel prices , cutting water and electricity tariffs and giving subsidized motorcycles and hefty pay increases to 1.6 million public servants .  rajapaksa has also promised a judicial inquiry into allegations that his troops killed 40,000 tamil civilians at the end of the civil war , although he still refuses to cooperate with a un-mandated investigation .  last week he told voters in the tamil-dominated northern peninsula of jaffna that he was committed to improving their livelihoods , listing a series of infrastructure projects in the war-ravaged region .  describing himself as the " known devil , " the president urged people not to vote for the " unknown " sirisena . " i am the known devil , so please vote for me , " he said through a translator .  tamils as king-makers  the tamils could be king-makers if the majority sinhalese constituency is split down the middle between rajapaksa and sirisena .  " we will vote for sirisena not because we like him , but because we company executive ratnavale chandrasekaran .  rajapaksa called snap elections two years ahead of schedule in the hope of preempting an opposition fight-back .  close associates say the timing was decided partly on advice given by his personal astrologer .  the 69-year-old , who has been accused of growing authoritarianism , had removed the two-term limit on the presidency and given himself more powers soon after winning a second term in 2010 .  sirisena 's defection was carefully choreographed by rajapaksa 's bete noire , former president chandrika kumaratunga , who returned to politics after a nine-year retirement , and has split the ruling party .  a hardline party of sinhalese buddhist monks that had cheered rajapaksa 's refusal to bow to an international probe defected to the opposition in november , accusing him of unprecedented corruption and nepotism .  the president 's eldest brother chamal is speaker of parliament , another brother basil is economic development minister while a third , gotabhaya , serves as the defense secretary .  other family members dominate state institutions and government-owned companies , with the rajapaksa tentacles extending host of ministerial portfolios including finance , ports and highways .  the progovernment media are predicting a close fight , while diplomats in colombo say they sense a shift in favor of the opposition .  last week one of sirisena 's top supporters accused the government of deploying thousands of troops to tamil-majority areas as part of a strategy to intimidate voters against backing rajapaksa 's main challenger .  the military has denied accusations of campaigning for rajapaksa .  as signs of opposition strength grew , the privately-run sunday times newspaper questioned the wisdom of rajapaksa 's decision to call a snap election .  " it was his own calling , " the paper said . " president mahinda rajapaksa for once goes as the underdog. "
