<h> Soldiers accused of raping 10 women <p> Human rights group Karapatan on Sunday slammed government troops for allegedly raping 10 women , including seven minors since President Benigno Aquino III took office in June 2010 . <p> " Soldiers do not only kill ; they rape children too . Amid the rising political killings under the Aquino regime , 10 women have been raped by state forces ; and seven of them are minors , " Karapatan secretary-general Cristina Palabay said . <p> " Soldiers and members of the Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit undressed girls , as young as 12 years old , and raped them . None of the perpetrators of the documented rape cases have been arrested or brought to jail , " she added . <p> One case , in particular , involved a 14-year-old lumad girl " Tess " who was raped twice by soldiers belonging to the 68th Infantry Battalion-Bravo Company stationed at Talaingod in Davao del Norte , Palabay said . <p> Palabay said the alleged rapists ? -- Private First Class Stanly Revil , Private First Class Joffrey Galot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a military court-martial . <p> The Philippine National Police has also filed criminal charges against the three soldiers . <p> The youngest victim , according to Palabay , was 12-year-old Nini who was allegedly raped by an aide of an officer from the 2nd Infantry Division . <p> " We believe there are more rape victims of soldiers and paramilitary forces but they are afraid and ashamed to report or file a complaint , " Palabay said . <p> " These heinous acts are not isolated cases that can be attributed to individual ' bad eggs ' in the military . The act of rape serves as a terror tactic to shame and silence women , their families and the community . This barbarism should be condemned , and military officials who employ this tactic in their counterinsurgency program should be punished , " she added . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .
