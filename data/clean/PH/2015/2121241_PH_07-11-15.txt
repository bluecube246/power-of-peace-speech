"  bootstrapping a crafts business  forty-eight years later , the country 's hobbyists are reclaiming the commercial space for specialty arts and crafts , and papemelroti stands out with its core offerings of handmade designs and concepts .  its 17 stores across mega manila and pampanga are sources of home , school , office , personal , and giveaway objects . it sells curios from woodcarving to jewelry , from metal craft to desk essentials .  the siblings are now running the family business with almost 5 .  patricia " patsy " paterno says that as chief operating officer , she handles the " non-artistic " aspects such as finances . peggy and meldy , also designers , navigate human resources and merchandising .  the brand proudly carries the works of their brother robert , award-winning graphic artist and former host of the television show art is kool . e-commerce , social media , and store displays are left in the hands of the youngest tina , who used to be a floor-squatting , purchase-wrapping salesgirl in their second shop in cubao 's ali mall .  paterno admits that they have gotten many things wrong along the way . nobody in the family had a business background in the beginning . even so , benny and corit insisted that they would not borrow capital from the bank . " my mom was a good saver , " she recalled .  " what she earned , she would use to buy things like dolls in divisoria to make dresses for . eventually , when there were more customers , my dad would buy samples from and christmas decor . "  their mother balanced creativity with marketing determination . " when we made figurines , my mom would bring a sample in her bag , and we would visit stores in makati city like erehwon and old storehouse and predictions , and she would show it to the owners . they were our first wholesale customers , i think . they liked how the figurines looked really crude and handmade , " shared paterno .  their father took a course on ceramics . copper plaques of horses also piqued his curiosity , so he also learned how to make them look antique . he would be very happy if one of the pieces sold , as he sold it " very expensive . "  selling self-expression , emotional connection  papemelroti 's growth can be traced back to its unique creations , the family 's handiwork that can not be found elsewhere in the world . it also developed a cult following among people who were moved by the inspirational text inscribed on the products .  the posters and positive sayings around the separating , according to paterno .  there is also the environmental thrust that underlies the business . " i support sustainable practices and technologies that promote the preservation of the environment . because of this , i prefer environment-friendly products , " said sheila austero , an environmental engineer who has been a papemelroti customer for around 10 years .  finishing her postgraduate studies in the university of the philippines , austero jots down notes from journal articles she reads , as well as reminders and notes regarding experiments , in a papemelroti notebook she received from a friend .  for almost half a century , the alejandros have faced numerous challenges in starting and sustaining the business . but they have also witnessed their successes trickle down to others , even if this was not their intention at first .  paterno remembers connie , her sister tina 's then-nanny . " she would also help out , and now she still works with us as the manager of our factory in bulacan . we had another helper , alice , and she also still works with with suppliers and distributors alike , has helped papemelroti gain a wider acceptance in the philippines . now , paterno said she is studying how to license their products to companies abroad .  three of benny and corit 's grandchildren have jumped in to create designs catering to a new generation -- paterno 's son and her niece , who are still studying , and elyse , another niece who is a graphic design graduate from up .  paterno also hints at a new concept to watch out for in their main branch on roces avenue , quezon city . " we will put up a gallery , a diy section , and we will also develop workshops . we are also putting a new system into place which will help us grow , " she explained .  perhaps papemelroti is plotting its continuity for the next 50 years , or for as long as there will be discarded things to be fashioned into useful or wondrous objects .  " i have always said that being in business is an expression of the best of yourself , our business will be unique as well , " related paterno .  " we can not just copy other businesses . we always have to innovate and grow , always have new things and new ideas . we should keep fresh and relevant .
