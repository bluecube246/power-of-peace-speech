<p> It 's a new year and , in keeping with the spirit of new beginnings , here are Inkcanto 's resolutions that , when followed properly , will result in peace , prosperity , and well-being for all . That sentence will be followed by three volumes of hard-bound , encyclopedic caveats that are due for publication in 2016 . In the meantime , just pretend that when it comes to credibility , I am really just winging it right now . <p> 1 . Be kinder and more generous -- and pay it forward . There more than 100 million Filipinos in this country . If even half of that number did an act of kindness in one day that would mean 50 million good deeds a day . Would n't that change our very atmosphere ? <p> We all go through hardships and many times , out of concern for personal survival , we can tend to think only of ourselves and then we try and get ahead -- with a promotion , with a project , with a little bit of corruption , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , Filipinos can be kind and generous and many of us are : but we are also survivors who will first take care of kith and kin first over strangers . That 's why our sense of civic duty is weak . In practice , we care more about relatives than the nation as a whole . <p> That 's mainly because -- and I 've suspected this for the longest time -- Filipinos are survivors first of all . We take care of our own first because clan survival is a priority . This also explains why our social values are split -- we follow different and often conflicting sets of values in our public and private lives . <p> We learned to be survivors after we were occupied by foreign powers , from Spain to the Americans , to the Japanese . We learned to look maintain an image of kowtowing to our oppressors while trying to squeeze some rebellious , seditious action through the cracks and hidden corners . <p> We learned to behave differently in public , where official authority is watching over us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , we are perpetually naughty teen-agers . There are few , if any , Filipino grown-ups . <p> Still , let 's all try to grow up and be true Filipinos caring for our nation . We can start by being kind and generous to others beyond our circle of kin . <p> 2 . Be friendlier on social media . Enough with the snark and the hate . Remember that photo of DILG Sec . Mar Roxas showing how his motorcycle fell on its side -- he was lucky that we able to put an arm down and break his fall . Otherwise , it would have been a serious face-plant on muddy gravel . Then all these people on social media started complaining that Sec . Roxas was n't wearing a helmet . <p> First of all , I seriously doubt that a helmet is a wise thing to wear when you 're riding through a hilly , forested area . You 'll need all your senses , especially hearing , when you travel through that terrain . A helmet limits your senses . Second , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job and got into an accident . Give him a break . <p> Also , let 's stop getting on newlyweds Dingdong Dantes and Marian Rivera 's case about how much they spent for their wedding ( allegedly P100 million ) . It 's their money , it 's their marriage , and it 's their life . They did n't spend taxpayers ' money for it . <p> Besides , Marian Rivera really does look enchanting in her wedding dress -- all P7 million worth of it . Looking at her photo , I realized that her million-peso wedding dress is 80 percent similar to my wife 's wedding gown -- which I bought in the late 1990s for P13,000 and paid for in installments for one whole year on a newspaper reporter 's salary . <p> ( My wife has strictly warned me not to post comparison photos of her and Marian wearing their respective wedding dresses . ) <p> A wedding is a woman 's chance to feel like a princess or a queen for a day , and I would never , ever get between that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author J.R.R. Tolkien writes , " Come not between the Nazgul and his ( or her ) prey . " That 's very good marital advice . <p> Photo by Robert Vinas , Malacanang Photo Bureau . <p> 3 . Post appropriately on the Internet . We 've all seen Internet posts that are way , way too much information . And there are others like this : <p> No good can come out when the words " husband and I " , " experimenting " , and " horse " appear in one paragraph . ( Image source : http : **137;434;TOOLONG ) So please use common sense and social etiquette when posting on social media . <p> 5 . Market yourself , seriously . You may have some pretty serious talent -- for whatever : baking , singing , being deathly annoying , dancing , knitting , organizing charities , managing relief operations , or mixed martial arts , etc. -- but if nobody knows you exist , then you wo n't be able to maximize the benefits that you -- and just as important , other people -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your fist meeting someone 's jaw in an MMA match is a " benefit " . ) <p> Take Australian poet Lang Leav , for example . With 74,000 followers on social media , her best-selling books of poetry are proof that even poets can take advantage of a little marketing buzz . <p> As somebody once said -- I think it was me -- to someone who probably was n't listening : " The difference between capitalism and communism is marketing . Now , hie thee off to a nunnery . " <p> 6 . Learn old stuff and new stuff . <p> That Tweet may have been sarcastic but what if it was serious ? What if the guy really thinks that Kanye West had really collaborated on the song , " Only One " with " newcomer " Paul McCartney ? <p> Whether we 're young or old , it pays to keep learning things -- whether that knowledge is in the present or from the past . Once , someone asked me if I " pirated " books . I replied : <p> " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I did that a few times but nowadays I 'm too far away from book-loving friends who can lend me books . " My friend told me : " I meant if you ever downloaded bootleg copies of e-books . From the Internet . " <p> Oh ... kay . So that dates me . Surely , this is how behind I am when it comes to the thieving of intellectual property . <p> On the other hand , I 'm happy , for example , that my kids also love listening to good music from decades past . Believe it or not , kids , there 's good music from decades ago , really good music that does not have " booty " as a lyric , unless it 's a song about real , live pirates who sailed on ships and talked like they had emphysema . <p> So I told my friend that I will learn to download an e-book . " Tapos , ipa-seroks mo , " she said , laughing her head off . <p> 7 . Be fashionable -- by not copying fashionable people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style by wearing what other fashionable people wear ? Do n't do that . Wear what you feel like and make it look good in your own way . That 's pretty tricky -- which is why it 's always safer to imitate others fashion-wise . Still , if you have enough imagination and creativity -- not to mention either sheer guts or a genetic lack of shame -- you can be stylish on your own terms . <p> Many people who are legally blind ; have Alzheimer 's ; or delusional , have told Inkcanto that he looks like French actor Alain Delon in a trench coat . Still , that red tie is just cheap and disgusting -- but less boring than Delon 's . <p> 8 . Be grateful , always . None of us will get out of this world alive -- and none of us will truly get anywhere worthwhile without help from others . The year 2014 was a less than stellar year for me on several areas of life and I would not have survived sane and alive without them . I promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As Germany 's great Romantic poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote , " We are all angels with but one wing and can only fly by holding hands and therefore , let us beware which hand we use to scratch our noses or behinds , lest we fall from a great height , oh , oh , oh .
