Two-Horse Race at the Top as Crown and Boeung Ket Win  PHNOM PENH ( Khmer Times ) -- Phnom Penh Crown FC and Boeung Ket Angkor FC maintained their duel at the top as both teams won their midweek games , although in drastically different circumstances .  Boeung Ket Angkor FC -- the league leaders -- demolished the impressive Cambodian Tiger FC in Wednesday afternoon 's highlight at Western Stadium . Chan Vathanaka was on target once more to bury his 24th goal of the season in the opening minutes of the tie .  Khuon Laboravy added a second midway through the half with Esoh Paul Omogba scoring for his third successive game late in the second-half . Laboravy sealed the Tigers ' fate with the team 's fourth - and his second in the 86th minute .  Elsewhere on Wednesday , champions Crown kept the heat on Boeung Ket with their 11th victory in 13 games as they found a way past NagaWorld FC in the season 's first game at the National Olympic Stadium .  The only goal of the Matnorotin providing the assist in the 56th minute as the South African drove the ball home at the far post for the win .  Asia Euro United FC held Svay Rieng FC 1-1 in Wednesday 's final game at the Olympic Stadium . Mohamed Hamza grabbed an equalizer for AEU after Sareth Kriya had put the Hun Sen Cup holders ahead earlier in the half .  After the game , Svay Rieng announced the team had been ordered to move their scheduled home matches against CMAC United FC and National Police Commissary FC to the Olympic Stadium . The decision by the Disciplinary committee of the FFC came as a result of crowd trouble during the latter stages of the game with Crown at Svay Rieng stadium earlier this month .  On Thursday , Ministry of National Defense FC defeated their Police FC counterparts by a 2-0 scoreline at Olympic stadium . Both goals came from ex-Crown player Jeongho Kim . The 25-year-old Korean utility player had parted ways with the champions earlier this month after struggling with injuries - although he showed no signs of trouble in side .  Meanwhile , CMAC United FC and Build Bright United ground out a hard-fought 2-2 draw at Army Stadium .  Thursday 's late game at Olympic Stadium saw Western Phnom Penh FC suffer an unlikely defeat as they succumbed 3-1 to the league 's bottom side Kirivong Sok Sen Chey .  It was Kirivong 's first win of the season , as Western coach Pen Phat oversaw his team 's eighth straight defeat .  Looking forward to the weekend , Crown will face Cambodian Tiger at Western Stadium on Saturday , while rivals Boeung Ket will be tested against Army on Sunday at Army Stadium . Elsewhere , Naga play AEU while Svay Rieng meet CMAC .  Kirivong looks to build on their first win against Police as Western attempts to reverse their decline against BBU.
