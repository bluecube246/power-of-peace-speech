NEW YORK - New Yorker Tyler Hickey usually spends Christmas Eve snowboarding on the nearest mountain . This year , he 's in a T-shirt and jeans while traversing Manhattan 's Bryant Park ice skating rink , which is melting into patchy puddles in record high temperatures .  " Last year , it was snowing like every day , " Hickey , 22 , said as he caught his breath with friend Raj Latcha , 27 , at the edge of the popular rink .  " The weather now is like summer , " Latcha said as young women in crop tops and men in shorts skated by to the tune of " O Come All Ye Faithful " played in smooth jazz on big overhead speakers .  The two were among many in the city enjoying the very un-winter-like weather as New York City smashed its record for the warmest Christmas Eve . The forecast for the coming days has melted any hopes for a snowy Christmas and New Year .  Temperatures hit the low-70s by midday , easily topping the previous National Weather Service .  " It looks like it will be the warmest December on record , " NWS meteorologist Carlie Buccola said .  The typical temperature in New York City for this time of year is 41 degrees and the average first measurable snowfall is on Dec. 9 .  The continued warm weather expected in the next week has delighted residents like Tony Batista , 59 . " It 's like paradise , " said Batista , who wore a Kobe Bryant NBA jersey and shorts to take in the city 's holiday activities outdoors .  But people like Tegan Jones , a 25-year-old Australian tourist exploring Central Park with friends , had broken Christmas dreams .  " We came to New York for a white Christmas and so far it 's pretty warm , about the same temperature as back home , " she said while runners went by in shorts .  Jones would take little satisfaction from knowing that the polar jet stream , which separates warm air from the cold , is pushing to the north , according to Buccola . stream , an affect that typically happens during the weather phenomenon known as El Nino .  New York City is not alone as the entire Northeast is getting a blast of heat . From Florida to Maine , high temperatures were setting records and holiday plans were changing course because of it .  At this time last year , Terry Hills golf course near Buffalo , New York , had closed for the season after being buried under a heap of snow . On Thursday , some 115 golfers , dressed in polo shirts and khakis , booked tee times at the course .  Rick Davis , who runs the Farm by the River Bed and Breakfast with Stables in North Conway , New Hampshire , counts the holiday season as one of his busiest times for taking patrons on sleigh rides .  Instead of 2 feet of snow , the sleighs will be pulled this holiday season past more than a mile of open fields , mountain views and the Saco River on wheels along dirt paths .  Davis ' wife , Charlene Browne ,  " I think people , they have good attitudes most of the time , " Browne said . " They 're creative , they substitute . "  Despite not being Christmas-like , the balmy conditions in the Northeast still was better than the deadly storms , including tornadoes , that hit the South on Wednesday .
