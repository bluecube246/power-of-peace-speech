<h> Dacawi : Remembering Manny <h> Dacawi : Remembering Manny <p> ( This reprint of a piece written after a visit to two indigenous community projects in the Cordillera is a tribute to Forester Manuel Pogeyed , a friend and colleague in the environmental field who understood the importance of village involvement in the preservation of the mossy forests of the Cordillera . It is a toast to his initiative and respect for indigenous knowledge that sustained our Cordillera mossy forests for generations as the life-blood of lowland agriculture and power generation in Northern Philippines . Manny passed on recently at 54. - RD ) <p> VILLAGE leader Paul Casiwan said they found four types of acorns in the remaining mossy forests . He sounded like he was trying to hide his excitement over the find . The acorns sounded like coffee beans as he poured them out of jute sacks and into iron buckets . <p> His group had spent days gathering and sorting them according to shape , texture , and size and variety . <p> They were of four sizes . The three smaller ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins at the tip and looking like light , shiny chocolate nuggets . The biggest was round , like a dull chestnut . Casiwan cracked a shell , popped the kernel into his mouth and chomped . He cracked another and offered the meat to visitors . It was hard , with an astringent taste like betel nut . <p> Acorns are basic food for birds and other animals that enrich the biodiversity of the mossy forest , he said . <p> Fellow worker Dominga Baliaga raked her hands into one of the aggregate piles , looking for those with tiny , whitish sprouts that must and damp coaxed out of their shells -- through the pins . Contrasted with the dominant color of chestnut , those with shoots were easy to spot . <p> Soon the germinating seeds will be sown in pots in tree nurseries they had carved and flattened out of steep mountainsides overlooking tributaries of the Abra River . When their leaves develop , they will be replanted in open spaces to expand the vanishing mossy forest cover of Agawa . <p> Until they started picking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northwestern Besao town , Mt . Province , took for granted what their mossy forests contain . They now have to have an eye for detail to be able to properly identify the different tree species , together with the herbs and plants they 'll have to propagate as source of tribal medicine . <p> The propagation of " payen " ( the native name for oak ) , " da-il " ( petroleum nut ) and other mossy forest species was part of a forest biodiversity project a few years back for Agawa and the adjoining barangays of Ambagiw , Gueday and Lacma-an in Besao . <p> Months later , a women 's group in Bayyo Barangay in the capital town of Bontoc also launched a similar community-based forest biodiversity project . It was concentrated in Mt . Polis , the fragile water source for several towns in Mt . Province and Ifugao that is also watershed of the Chico River flowing into the rice lands of the Cagayan Valley . <p> The two projects scheduled for two to three years were supported by the Small Grants Program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forester Manny Pogeyed , now the provincial environment officer of Mt Province , set in motion the projects by helping the two communities conceive and draft the proposals . <p> Earlier , Pogeyed , then the head of the community environment and natural resources office in Sabangan , Mt . Province , also mobilized the northern barangays of Sagada town for a headwaters enhancement project , also in a tie-up with SGP-UNDP . <p> He admitted that regular government outlays for forestry programs are very limited and spread too thin , prompting the need to tap other support institutions for the preservation of the mossy forests . <p> Until now , the mossy and pine forests that are unique to the village and most of the Cordilleras have been overlooked in the national forestry master plan . Conservation efforts are focused more on the common tropical foliage of these islands , from the mangrove to the dipterocarp and molave found up to 800 meters above sea level . <p> Unlike the lower forests , the dwindling pine and mossy forests have been classified only for protection , without provisions for reforestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests , make the Cordillera the vital watershed cradle of Northern Luzon , the source of water that is the lifeblood of the electric dams and the lowland farms . <p> " Mossy forest conservation and development had not been given attention by development agencies in the past , " noted the Agawa project paper . " The ecological and scientific significance of this type of ( forest ) , with its diverse vegetation endemic in a highland environment , is worth providing a conservation push at this point in time . " <p> As the headwaters , the mossy forest acts like a sponge that gradually releases rainwater into the tributaries of river systems . While it 's damp condition insulates it from heat , its natural elevation immediately above or beside the easily combustible pine stands makes it partly vulnerable to fires . <p> " Forest fires prevalent during the dry season creep into the edges of the mossy forest , " the Bayyo project noted . <p> The Bayyo women also pointed out that the expansion through regeneration of pine stands within areas formerly covered by oak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This has something to do with allelopathy , the nature of pine to exude resin toxic to other species , enabling it to spread and dominate areas earlier cleared by fires or for swidden farms . This is evident along the mountainsides above the Talubin River towards Bayyo where pine has taken over mountaintops and areas once covered by mossy forests . Some surviving oaks are limited to the waterway gullies or below the invasive conifer stands . <p> For generations , traditional village forest management systems , rather than state policies that sometimes clash with time-tested tribal laws , protected the integrity of the pine and the dwarf oak forests . Like the mossy forest , however , these indigenous practices that were the original models of community-based resource management are also vanishing . <p> The two projects in Agawa and Bayyo , therefore , were anchored on the revival and documentation of these traditional practices , together with the folk wisdom on medicinal species . <p> In one of the Bayyo nurseries , Diana Peta-ul and Alicia Wayasen showed visitors several types of mountain tea which they claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " dumranoh " , the bark of which is usually dried into " humang " , grated and drank as a cure for fever and bum stomach . <p> While doing site visits for the projects , Pogeyed heard more revealing insights , among them a common observation of hunters and village elders who come across snakes battling forest rats . <p> " They noticed that each time the rat is bitten , it runs to a certain tree , digs its teeth into the bark and returns to continue the fight .
