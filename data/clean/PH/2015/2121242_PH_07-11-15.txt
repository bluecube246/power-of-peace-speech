"  ( i hope they have mercy on the poor . that is all that we are considering , how to help the poor . ) mass at the tacloban astrodome , which became the refuge of evacuees at the height of the 2013 disaster . the storm killed over 6,000 and left thousands homeless as storm surges and strong wind flattened tacloban , the commercial hub of the region .  the senator said lawmakers like himself are not even informed where the billions in pesos allocated for yolanda victims went , and how this was spent .  " we do not have an accounting , an assessment , a report , nothing . they just give these vague answers , " marcos said .  the budget department said that of the p150 billion ( $3.195 billion ) required for rehabilitation , p93.87 billion ( $1.998 billion ) was released . the balance of p10.2 billion ( $217.20 million ) will be released this november , and the remaining p46 billion ( $979.50 million ) is in the budget for 2016 .  marcos also rejected the pronouncement of the national economic and development authority ( neda ) that the rehabilitation program is 51% complete , based on the plan of former rehabilitation secretary masterplan of ping lacson , on the ground what was completed is still far from 51% . )  as an example , marcos cited national housing authority figures for housing where he said only 6% of permanent shelter has been constructed .  " there are still thousands of people who are homeless . many are still waiting for the government 's promise . many do not know where are the funds donated , including from our overseas filipino workers , aid agencies , until now , the government agencies do not want to give us an answer . many remain victims , waiting for assistance , " he said .  asked how he will help yolanda victims if he wins as vice president , marcos said he will " clarify what exactly the government intends to do . "  " let 's find out how much money is given , where is it , what is it going to be used for and when will it be finally spent to help yolanda victims . "  aquino critics unite ?  marcos joined a commemorative walk early his running mate , senator gregorio honasan ii . marcos ' cousin , leyte representative martin romualdez , was also at the event .  rivals for the vice presidency , marcos and honasan said the event was not political , and only meant to highlight the plight of the yolanda victims .  honasan said : " relief operations , disaster risk reduction management , you ca n't say it 's an opposition effort , or an administration effort . everyone who can help should join so we can conduct a performance audit of what has been done . "  binay 's vice presidential bet agreed with marcos that the government failed to provide an accounting of the donations and budget allocated for yolanda .  " we 're moving towards line-item budgeting . let 's ensure tracking , auditing and accounting mechanisms are in place because just like previous issues , this is not a question of wasted resources . it 's a breakdown of control systems . it 's a good thing this assessment is happening on the eve of budget deliberations , " said honasan . he went around leyte to see how the national disaster risk reduction and management law can be improved . the senator was among the authors of the law .  honasan said he was open to consider the proposal of several senators to create a permanent agency handling disasters to replace the national disaster risk reduction and management council ( ndrrmc ) , now under the defense department .  " but it will depend on the resources available , the political , the financial , logistical cost of adding another bureaucracy but that 's something we can seriously consider , " he said .  romualdez though filed a bill to push for a separate department handling disasters . the senatorial candidate said that the ndrrmc is just an ad hoc council while social welfare officials are busy handling other programs of their own department .  under romualdez 's plan , the department for disaster risk reduction will be headed by a secretary , and will have its own budget . presidential bet senator grace poe , and vice presidential candidate senator alan peter cayetano filed similar proposals . need for the agency .  " what happens is ndrrmc would just coordinate a supplemental budget that we would be tasked in congress to pass . depending on how grave the calamity is , we will get money from different sources to fund a rehab plan made only after one tragedy . we need a more proactive stance and a department for that purpose . i think it 's high time we borrow from best practices .
