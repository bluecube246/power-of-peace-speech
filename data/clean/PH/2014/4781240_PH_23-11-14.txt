<p> Retired Rep Herminio G Teves has accepted the invitation to be the 66th Charter Day speaker for Dumaguete celebration . In a short press statement Meniong Teves said that he is concerned about up coming power shortage in that the energy department should brace Sanggunian . <p> But Board Member Liland Estacion , a physician and Chairman of the Committee on Health in the Sanggunian , explained that the problem stemmed from the fact that a request was made on January 2014 that the 40 job order workers including 26 nurses , whose wages were previously charged under the Governor ? s Office , were transferred to the NOPH , which was proper for it is where they are actually rendering service . <p> But the request was approved only last August with the observation that nurses must be given contracts of service and not mere job orders . Nevertheless , since they had no funding source for the wages of those transferred from the Governor ? s office for the period January to July , it was necessary to utilize the funds originally appropriated for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NOPH . <p> Hence , the need to replenish the funds amounting to P 1.5 million to be sourced out from the NOPH surplus pegged at P 29 million so that those affected Job order workers shall be paid of their wages , Estacion said . <p> Liga ng mga Barangay President Arnie Teves is expected to raise a question as to why if it was true that the NOPH has surplus funds , it still could not afford to stock the hospital pharmacy with enough medical supplies to help the indigent patients .
