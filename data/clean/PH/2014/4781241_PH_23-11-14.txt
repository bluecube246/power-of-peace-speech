Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change . Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) .  Exactly 5 years ago today , November 24 , a small group of bloggers launched what they thought would be a 6-month foray into voters education . Looking ahead to the 2010 elections , they just wanted to do their share for the country by using their respective online networks to spread information that would be helpful for voters . Little did they know that what they began that day would help spark the growing flame that is now referred to as ' citizen advocacy ' .  Noemi Lardizabal-Dado ( L ) and Jane Uymatiao ( R )  Here is Blog Watch 's story as told by two of its co-founders , Noemi Lardizabal-Dado and Jane Uymatiao .  Noemi : ( On Blog Watch 's humble beginnings )  A bloggers ' meetup with Mar Roxas in 2008 brought bloggers as elections approach .  The Philippine Center for Journalism ( PCIJ ) knew the importance of bloggers for the 2010 election . PCIJ invited me for a training seminar on " Covering Elections in the Era of Internet and Automation " on August 26 , 2009 .  Fate was on my side when a chance meeting with Kristine Mandigma , Program director of Vibal Foundation , heard of my training and invited me with other bloggers to start a citizens ' portal for the Philippine Online Chronicles ( POC )  Jane : ( On the first Blog Watch meeting and how it got its name )  In 2009 Noemi asked if I wanted to do voters education to take advantage of our readership network . Noemi rallied other blogger friends to join , too . Mind you , most of us were just food , travel , mommy , and tech bloggers .  We met up in October 2009 . Someone suggested we give our group a name . Noemi wanted the word ' Blog ' since we were all bloggers . I contributed the November 24 , 2009 , " Blog Watch " was formally announced to the press . We did not know it then but Blog Watch would live up to the name we originally gave it -- bloggers/netizens watching what is happening to the country .  BLOG WATCH .

All photos by Philippine Online Chronicles  Noemi : ( On the birth of the #Juanvote community )  It was decided that Blog Watch would interview presidential candidates so we could scrutinize their platforms and vision for the country . Getting appointments with presidential candidates was a challenge at first . Using our own network of friends , we managed to invite 7 out of the 9 presidential candidates .  While conducting interviews , we simultaneously tweet , plurk ( works similarly to Twitter but in 210 characters ) or post on Facebook . It was not uncommon to see us holding up a camera in one hand while holding a mobile phone in the other for livestreaming .  For the first automated election through a collaboration with other netizens .  The media model in 2009 was mainly via mainstream media . So when we began writing , interviewing , livestreaming , and opening online video channels , media organizations asked us if we were ' citizen journalists ' or ' citizen media ' .  Our real purpose for existence was not to bring news to the public ; that was for mainstream media to do . We were ordinary citizens , enabled by technology and social media with an online voice , so we could push for reforms , effect social change , and achieve social good . It meant taking a stand , to advocate . We were " citizen advocates " !  It is a continuing effort to stay credible , present all sides of an issue and write responsibly . Blog Watch has writers with views that span left- , right- , and center-of-field perspectives . Mainstream media continues to be our source of information but our strength remains in the use of social media over different platforms .  Noemi : ( On why been involved in )  During our launch , we announced to the press that the Blog Watch project is only for the duration of the campaign . After the elections , Blog Watch decided to continue on and shift its focus towards citizen empowerment .  Despite the limited funding and other challenges , Blog Watch is here to stay . Collaboration is taking place with Project Agos for our common goal to address climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction .  For citizen empowerment , we will continue to tap our #Juanvote network and collaborate with the Computer Professionals ' Union ( CPU ) VoteReportPH project that utilizes the Ushahidi Platform and Frontline SMS .  SENATORIAL FORUM . Blog Watch covers the Rundown 2013 Senatorial Forum at the University of the Philippines-Diliman in February 2013  Jane : ( On the future of Blog Watch )  A challenge before Blog Watch now is going beyond cyberspace to reach out to offline citizens . We hope to expand our #Juanvote community . At the same time , it 's important to remain alert to new social media internet access .  It is difficult to say exactly how future technology will enable netizens differently on social media . But Blog Watch aims to remain as flexible as it was in 2009 .  There 's one thing we know for sure : we do what we do to create the kind of government we have always dreamed of for our children -- one that is transparent and operates with good governance . By helping empower all citizens to use social media for social good , we hope to live to see that part of the vision for a government " of the people , by the people ...
