AP  KIEV , Ukraine -- Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are rallying in the center of Kiev , in defiance of recent legislation that significantly curbs their rights to protest .  Last week President Viktor Yanukovych caused an uproar at home and abroad when he approved a number of laws that limit Ukrainians ' rights to protest , civic activism and free speech . The United States called that legislation " undemocratic . "  The move was aimed at quashing the protests calling for his ouster , which have rocked Kiev and other cities in Ukraine for nearly two months . The protests were sparked by Yanukvoych 's decision to freeze ties with the European Union and embrace Russia instead . They were intensified by police violence .
