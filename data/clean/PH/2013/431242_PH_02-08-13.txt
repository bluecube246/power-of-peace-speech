It 's the result of a new policy.Starting mid-July , only buses with terminals in the city can pass through Manila . The city government revises the ban a week later -- only valid bus franchises are allowed to enter , 10 at a time . Loading and unloading is allowed only at designated bus stops and terminals.Manila Vice Mayor Isko Moreno says the bus ban will help a ' deteriorating ' Manila turn into a ' gate to heaven from being a ' gate to hell . ' But commuters ask : who really benefits from the new scheme ? Workers and students who live in nearby cities are forced to change their routes . Buses from Quezon City without terminals inside Manila , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joseph does n't take that route because it costs him an extra 5 pesos . But taking a jeep home also means 20 more minutes traveling from his school to Quezon City . <p> JOSEPH SANTIZASMANILA COMMUTER Bus , bus lang , isang sakay lang . Ngayon jeep nalang kasi pag magdalawang sakay ako , mas mahal . ( I used to take a single bus to work . Now I take a jeep because if I do n't , I 'll be paying more . ) <p> Moreno says the move will benefit everyone -- Manila residents as well as " transients , " -- those who work and study but live outside the Philippine capital . <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change .
