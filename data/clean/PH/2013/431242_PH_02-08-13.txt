' but commuters ask : who really benefits from the new scheme ? workers and students who live in nearby cities are forced to change their routes . buses from quezon city without terminals inside manila , go . joseph does n't take that route because it costs him an extra 5 pesos . but taking a jeep home also means 20 more minutes traveling from his school to quezon city .  joseph santizasmanila commuter bus , bus lang , isang sakay lang . ngayon jeep nalang kasi pag magdalawang sakay ako , mas mahal . ( i used to take a single bus to work . now i take a jeep because if i do n't , i 'll be paying more . )  moreno says the move will benefit everyone -- manila residents as well as " transients , " -- those who work and study but live outside the philippine capital .  would you like to share your vote ?  welcome to rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change . rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) .
