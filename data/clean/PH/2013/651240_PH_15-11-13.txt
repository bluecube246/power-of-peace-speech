for weeks now , we 've been keeping tabs of the proceedings on " showtime 's " " that 's my tomboy " personality and talent tilt , which is creating a buzz because it 's the first showcase that 's been provided for the country 's tomboys , t-birds or lesbians . heretofore , only male gays had the run of the small screen , while their lesbian counterparts were sort of restricted to the sidelines , or even the shadows , except for the forthright likes of aiza seguerra and charice .  what seemed to be the problem ? we asked around , and some tv people volunteered their feeling that " tomboys " were n't as " entertaining " as flaming fairies ! they tried too hard to act " macho , " and that made them come off as too tough , heavy and humorless to be entertaining .  but , all that 's in the past : with " that 's my tomboy , " lesbians have been given their own noontime showcase and opportunity to strut their stuff , for some of them , to shine .  advertisement  true enough , the tilt thus far has pretty much decided to play it safe , and most of its contestants have been of the young , " cute " and " sort of pilyo " type -- nothing too brusque or threatening -- and , absolutely no bull-dykes , please .  we do notice that , from time to time , a less cute and more idiosyncratic tomboy is featured , so the tilt may get a bit edgier as the weeks progress and viewers get less uptight .  eigenmann . has lost 30lbs -- and counting .  another upbeat development is the emergence of the tomboy tilt 's first real singing discovery , who made a strong impression last week by doing a split-gender , boy-girl act , during which she did full vocal justice to both parts of her " self-duet . "  in addition , she came across as a confident entertainer and personality , unlike many other contestants who are merely personable , or can dance a little . will the tomboy discovery ? knock on wood !  elsewhere on the tube , we 're glad that some obese stars are starting to lose weight . for instance , aga muhlach is beginning to look lighter , more boyish and cuter ( despite his already being in his 40s ) on his new game-quiz show , " let 's ask pilipinas . " we hear , too , that geoff eigenmann has lost more than 30 pounds -- and counting .  we hope that other overweight stars will also motivate themselves to get back into genuine performing trim in the coming weeks and months . their careers will definitely gain from their determined loss of dross -- and gross !
