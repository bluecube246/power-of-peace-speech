Two days after typhoon Yolanda wreaked havoc on the Philippines , Eastern Samar Representative Ben Evardone boarded a private plane to undertake an aerial survey of his home province .  As he scanned the ground below , he saw homes demolished , structures destroyed , and human life decimated .  Some of the villages were no longer there , the lawmaker said , barely able to control his emotions .  When he was finally able to land and saw the bleak fate that befell his provincemates , Evardone he knew it would take years before the place could get back on its feet .

If you use a new variety , you wait for three to five years . In the meantime , what will they do , what will you do with your children , " he said .
