tokyo - the japanese government said friday it would deploy three self-defense forces ( sdf ) vessels to the typhoon-ravaged leyte island in the philippines , with as many as 1 , 000 sdf personnel expected to assist with relief efforts there and throughout the philippines .  japan 's foreign and defense ministry officials said friday the operation , which is expected to swing into full gear as early as next week , would mark the biggest mobilization of sdf troops for a relief mission ever overseas .  with leyte island and its surrounding waters being used as the primary base for japan 's troops , personnel will also be deployed from the vessels to the hard-hit city of tacloban where emergency supplies , including food and fuel are running dangerously low , ministry officials said .  transportation of supplies and troops between leyte and the mainland by japan 's first-responders has already taken place utilizing japan 's air self-defense force 's osprey planes -- their first official deployment outside of okinawa -- as well as regular helicopters , defense ministry officials said . successfully airlifted vital medical equipment , medicine to combat the rampant spread of infectious diseases in the area , water purification units as well as generators to central cebu island , but additional japanese medical personnel have also been stranded in manila awaiting regular flights to cebu , officials here said , hampering the ongoing relief mission .  efforts have also been hamstrung by civil unrest and with some areas posing security risks to troops and rescue workers .  " what we are watching most carefully is the local security situation , " shigeru iwasaki , chief of the sdf 's joint staff , said at a recent press briefing .  " we will gather information not only from the philippine government , but also from us military troops who are working there so we will be able to secure the safety of our personnel , " he was quoted by local media as saying , with reference to instances of looting and gunfire in some of the disaster-hit areas that remain un-policed .  next week 's deployment from japan will greatly assist international relief efforts underway minister itsunori onodera said friday , with calls for japan to bolster medical and rescue efforts , which have been hampered by fuel shortages making it difficult for vehicles to access those in need and civil unrest which has compromised the security environment there .  onodera said the two maritime self-defense force 's transport vessels are being equipped with helicopters and supplies at the kure naval base located in hiroshima prefecture , prior to their disembarkation .  the japanese government also announced friday that it was tripling its emergency aid package for the philippines to more than $30 million , with $2-million worth of emergency relief goods being channeled through japan-based charities and non- governmental organizations here , the foreign ministry said .  the ministry confirmed that it has earmarked a total of around $52 million in emergency funding , which also comprises a $20-million contribution to its poverty reduction fund at the manila-based asian development bank .
