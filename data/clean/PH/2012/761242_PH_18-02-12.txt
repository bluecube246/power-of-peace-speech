Earnest, committed portrayals make Angel-Lloydie rom-com viewable

<p> Angel Locsin and John Lloyd Cruz 's new " more adult " rom-com , " Unofficially Yours , " breaks some of the " rules " of its film type , like slowly but surely settling up its love story , so that viewers can empathize with every step of the lead couple 's romance , up to its final , blissful climax and apotheosis -- which is usually a big wedding . <p> That may work for most rom-coms , but Cathy Garcia-Molina 's new film turns the tried and tested format on its head -- by starting with Angel and John Lloyd in the full throes of a one-night stand ! The " shocking " or at least surprising scene explains the flick 's " more adult " tag and marks at least an uptick in the screen couple 's continuing process of " maturation . " <p> It works better for Angel than it does for Lloydie , because his relatively soft and " healthy " physique is not exactly the stuff of which " bolder " bed scenes are made , or made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being " game " enough to add bite to their previously safe screen " exposure " ( literally ) . Some other popular stars would have balked at the " edgier " challenge , so hats off to the two for their guts -- or gumption . <p> After that " hot " opening sequence , the characters go back to being strangers -- until , by some corkscrewy twist of fate , they find themselves working in the same newspaper office ! <p> John Lloyd is clearly smitten , but Angel does n't reciprocate because , we find out in due time , she 's been burned by the fickle flames of love , so one-night or one-month stands are fine with her -- absolutely no commitments , please ! <p> John Lloyd grudgingly agrees to the rather cold and utilitarian arrangement -- but , viewers may be less amenable to it because , just a few months ago , they watched another movie about a hard-hearted girl ( " My Cactus Heart " ) , so perhaps they ca n't be blamed for wondering why they 're being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After dealing with that momentary downer , however , the viewer can still find interesting things in the film to keep watching . For one thing , the two leads ' portrayals are nothing if not earnest and committed . <p> Still , John Lloyd looks a bit too mature for his role . So , when he occasionally indulges in pa-cute and " pang-kilig " antics , they come off as rather forced and inappropriate . <p> Angel comes off better but she , too , is limited by her tense way of delivering her lines , at times even through clenched teeth . If this is motivated by her perception of the unhappiness of the character she plays , it 's a distracting rather than clarifying gambit . <p> Penultimately , the movie reveals the details of Angel 's previous love trauma , but the sharing comes too late to be truly useful . Another limitation is that her former lover is played by Patrick Garcia , whose vague performance adds little to our understanding of the issues . <p> Finally , Angel 's last-minute change of heart is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because no newspaper would allow itself to be used for such personal , self-serving purposes . <p> All told , " Unofficially Yours " has more going against rather than for it -- but , the leads ' committed portrayals keep us hoping for the best -- up to the final fade .
