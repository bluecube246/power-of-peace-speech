THERE 'S no denying that budget airlines have fueled the growth of air travel in the country .  A decade ago , taking the plane was the sole province of the rich . Today , a high-level corporate executive could be sitting in the same row as a household helper on a flight to Cebu and no one would give a second glance .  Government data on air traffic show just how much the industry has changed since the entry of budget carriers in the middle of the last decade .  ADVERTISEMENT  In 2006 , flag carrier Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) was the undisputed leader in domestic travel with over 3.8 million passengers , giving it a healthy market share of 45 percent . Domestic air passengers for the year totaled 8.47 million .  In 2011 , the number of domestic passengers who traveled by air in the country rose to 18.76 million , up 122 percent from 2006 , data from the Civil Aeronautics Board show .  PAL 's market share has shrunk to 23 percent , while Cebu in 2006 ) , with 8.44 million domestic passengers flown last year .  The number of passengers that the country 's low-cost carriers or LCCs have carried has been rising steadily .  Cebu Pacific , for instance , posted a growth of 46 percent in 2007 , 20.46 percent in 2008 , 34.71 percent in 2009 , 10.36 percent in 2010 , and 6.18 percent in 2011 .  On the other hand , PAL saw its annual domestic passenger numbers drop in 2010 and 2011 by 12.16 percent and 18.81 percent , respectively .  Even the PAL group recognized the potential of low-cost carriers . Its affiliate , now named AirPhil Express , cornered 11.44 percent of the market in 2006 . Last year , AirPhil Express had a market share of 20 percent in domestic traffic -- nearly making up for what PAL lost .  Zest Airways , owned by Zest-O juice drink founder Alfred Yao , had less than 5 percent of the market in 2006 but cornered 11 percent in 2011 after serving 2.15 million passengers .  On the international front , PAL enjoyed a virtual monopoly of international passenger traffic carried by local airlines . The flag carrier carried 3.05 million passengers that year , roughly a third of the total of 9.73 million passengers , inclusive of traffic that went to foreign airlines with operations in the Philippines .  That year , only two other local carriers had international operations . Cebu Pacific flew 429,522 passengers in 2006 , while Zest Airways had under 6,000 passengers .  In 2011 , there were six local airlines with operating international routes . PAL remained the leader in international traffic with 3.90 million passengers last year , but this was notably down from 3.93 million in 2010 .  Cebu Pacific , however , flew 2.46 million passengers for the year , more than five times its international volume in 2006 .  Counting only the international traffic handled by local airlines , which totaled 6.96 million in 2011 , PAL had a market share of 56 percent , Cebu Pacific had 35 percent , Zest Airways had 3.12 percent , Southeast Asian Airlines ( Seair ) had 3.01 percent , and de Manila Airlines had a market share of 0.6 percent .
