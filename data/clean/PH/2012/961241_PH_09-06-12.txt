<p> Food stalls line a busy street in Villasis , Pangasinan . Photo by Willie Lomibao <p> VILLASIS , Pangasinan -- On a good day , Leticia Flores sells at least 700 pieces of tupig ( grilled powdered glutinous rice wrapped in banana leaves ) from her stall near the town hall here . <p> At P5 apiece , that 's at least P3,500 -- more than enough for her to pay for the ingredients she needs every day to keep her small business going . <p> " This is really a big help for my family , " says Flores , who has been selling tupig for 10 years . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " This business has taught us to live ; it fed our families and sent our kids to school , " adds Elvira Ordo ? ez , 48 , who started selling tupig when she was 16 . <p> Their work begins at night when they mix by hand powdered glutinous rice , sugar , grated coconut , coconut milk and margarine in a large basin . They wrap the mixture in banana leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We just have to be very patient , " says Ordo ? ez . <p> Flores says their product must be better than the tupig being sold in other Pangasinan towns to win the loyalty of customers . <p> " Our customers come to us . We do not have to run and chase passenger buses just to sell tupig , " she explains . <p> Flores says Anjo Farms , an exporter of Pangasinan food products based in San Fabian town , often orders tupig from her for export . <p> Two women tend to their delectable wares .

" When they were inside the public market , they only sold until 10 a.m . When we placed them here , their income increased because they can now sell all day , " she says . <p> Abrenica says it also helps that tupig made in this town tastes better than those from other towns which are harder , smaller and wrapped in thick banana leaves . Thus buyers looking for the best tupig come to Villasis . <p> The town government also taught tupig makers and vendors how to make their products presentable so that they can command a better price . This is why tupig makers can sell their products at P100 a box with 20 pieces . <p> " As it is , it 's already good . But we are encouraging them to further improve their packaging , " says Abrenica.
