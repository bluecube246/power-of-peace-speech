A brother of action star Robin Padilla is facing charges for allegedly threatening to shoot a man and lob a grenade at his house in February 2003 in Quezon City .  Nearly a decade after the incident , Assistant City Prosecutor Rafael Villordon found probable cause to file a case of grave threats against Roy " Royette " Cari ? o Padilla , a one-time actor with an address on Maple Street , West Fairview .  Padilla is a member of the famous clan whose members include show biz personalities like brother Robin and the transsexual BB Gandanghari ( formerly Rustom Padilla ) .  ADVERTISEMENT  No stranger to controversy , Royette made headlines in the 1990s when he claimed being a " brigadier general " in a group called H-World United Nations Philippine Military Government International Police Commission .  A two-page indictment concerning the 2003 complaint was received on Feb. 15 by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Quezon City Metropolitan Trial Court .  It stemmed from allegations that Padilla had threatened to harm Johnny Solevilla on Feb. 's home in Barangay San Antonio at around 1 a.m. to see his daughter , Ivonne .  Villordon said Padilla 's alleged statement that he would lob a grenade and shoot Solevilla amounted to grave threats .  " Said threats amounted to a crime of arson and murder , and the threats were not subject to a condition , " the prosecutor said in a resolution dated Dec. 1 , 2011 . " Bail is not necessary unless required by the court . "  Padilla was actually the first to file a complaint against Solevilla for illegal discharge of firearms and oral defamation . He claimed hearing Solevilla cursing him and firing a gun as he was pressing the doorbell of the house , prompting him to report the matter to the police and the media .  Villordon dismissed the complaint against Solevilla for insufficiency of evidence .
