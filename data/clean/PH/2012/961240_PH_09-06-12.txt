<p> LOS ANGELES -- " I 'm doing great now , " said Alex O'Loughlin in an interview in LA last Wednesday . He spoke for the first time about his break from his TV show , " Hawaii Five-0 , " after checking into rehab last March . <p> The actor , looking fit , tan and sporting a full beard , underwent supervised treatment for prescription pain medication due to injuries he sustained while doing the hit CBS series . <p> " I got hurt pretty bad on the show and I ended up taking painkillers to get to work , " said the actor who plays Steve McGarrett in the successful reboot of the show that originally starred Jack Lord . " I had trouble getting off them . That 's as complicated as it gets . " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Alex added that he " gets knocked around a lot on the show . I do a lot of my own stunts and I have done so from the beginning . I am not 20-something anymore as you can see from the dusting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Australian actor admitted : " It was really difficult for me to be away . The hardest part was like when something is so enormous in your life -- I 'm at work 14 hours every day -- and then all of a sudden , you 're not at work . I got a lot of letters and messages from people saying , ' Where are you ? ' or ' It 's so weird not to see you in the show . ' " <p> Like nothing happened <p> O'LOUGHLIN on the day of the Inquirer interview photo by Ruben V. Nepales <p> Being away from the set has made Alex realize a few things . " Probably the biggest thing is how responsible for the show I actually feel , " he said . " I do n't know if that 's my job to feel that way or whatever . " <p> He gushed : " Personally , I 'm fantastic . It 's like nothing happened . I am still doing physical therapy three times a week . I 'm back and doing lots of jiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stuff . I just have to say no to some of the stunts that I love doing so much . I enjoy doing that stuff but I 've learned to let the stuntmen do those . " <p> Blessed with Aussie humor , Alex 's face lit up when asked about his fans . " I 've got really fantastic fans from all over the world , " he said . " One of the errors of my career was doing a vampire show ( ' Moonlight ' ) . The fans that I got from that show are very committed . They will never ever see me as anything other than Mick St. John . " <p> Asked about the strange gifts he gets in his fan mail , Alex smiled as he revealed , " I receive underwear -- some clean , some not . No joke . My assistant who helps me with my fan mail constantly threatens to quit because of what we get sent ... More from the Europeans ... avant-garde type Germans , French , Dutch ... I see the Amsterdam postmark and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " <p> His kind of gal <p> As for the kind of woman he goes for , Alex said : " She has to be smart and funny . Funny is really important . If a day goes by and we have n't been laughing , then I get really sad . Life is so ridiculous that if you ca n't see the irony of it , you 're going to have a really hard time while you 're here . Brains and common interests are important , too . I need to be able to admire the woman I 'm with and to look up to her . And for her to have the things that I want to have more of in myself , like integrity and dignity . I want to have an equal partner . I do n't want to be a boss and I do n't want to be too much like an underling , either . I want to be right there with her . " <p> For " Hawaii Five-0 " fans , Alex offered some hints as to what to expect : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flips the whole game on its head . Everything 's changed . The nature of everything he thought about that had been going on , he 's got to go back and reevaluate not only how he feels about everything but also of the information that he 's had . All of the clues that he 's been following , this investigation that 's ongoing about the death of his parents , who 's behind it and who 's filtering the information . " <p> He cited that " McGarrett is such a strange character to play . Over the last couple of years , we 've found , especially with his relationship to Danno ( Scott Caan 's character ) , more comedy and bits of chemistry to break up that hard military kind of backbone . But McGarrett is still this guy who gets locked in on something . Nothing will stop him . This is going to complicate his world even more . He 's probably going to become even more paranoid and even more difficult for Danno and the other guys to work with , which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " <p> Island fever ? Not ! <p> Alex has no complaints about working in what many consider is paradise . " I think the reason I 'm so comfortable in Hawaii is because I leave a lot , " he explained . " I love it there . I own a house there . My son ( Saxon ) is with me and he goes to school there . I do n't get island fever because , like I said , I leave a lot . " <p> His son , Saxon , is almost 15 and very athletic , said Alex . " I 've been promising to take him snowboarding his whole life which essentially makes me a neglectful parent , does n't it ? Because it took me 15 years to do it . I 've taken him to do virtually everything else . He surfs every day . He does a lot of stuff but he 's like , ' We got to go snowboarding . ' I thought , OK , since it has taken me so long , I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really good . I took him to Charmonix ( France ) . He did great . He snowboarded for four days . I snowboarded for about a day and a half and then spent the next two days with ice packs on my hips . I had a great time . I love Europe . I do n't speak a lick of French but I speak a bit of Italian . I can get through Italy better than I get through the rest of Europe . <p> " Hawaii Five-0 " also stars Daniel Dae Kim , Grace Park and Masi Oka . " Scotty comes back to LA , " Alex replied when asked about how his costars spend their breaks from shooting . " He is doing a play here in LA . This is his home and I feel that he 's more comfortable in LA than he does over there . I think Grace might feel the same about Canada . She goes back when she gets the chance . Daniel lives in Hawaii and is building a house there at the moment . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character has different arcs . We come together and work as a team . "
