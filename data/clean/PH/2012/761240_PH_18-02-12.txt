<p> CIVETS ( alamid ) are cat-like creatures , with a proclivity for sweet coffee berries . <p> The civet was traditionally hunted as a pest , but a booming market in civet coffee has changed its fate , turning it from ' pest ' into ' producer ' . <p> Civets ( alamid ) are cat-like nocturnal creatures , with a proclivity for sweet coffee berries . The discerning civet will choose only the ripest berries from the coffee tree , and process the pulp , but not the bean . <p> It takes around 20 minutes for the carnivorous creature to digest the berry and discard the bean , intact . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Gastric juices of the civet penetrate the coffee bean , leaving tiny holes , only visible under a microscope . The digestion process produces an inimitable coffee tasting experience . <p> Rare , unique product <p> Coffee aficionados ca n't get enough of this rare and unique product . Selling for as much as $50 per cup in luxury markets , civet coffee is the most expensive coffee in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest markets for the luxury beverage , but demand continues to grow across the world . <p> Gerald Jr . works the land of his father and grandfather , spanning some 40 hectares of dense , native forest . His mission is to preserve traditional Ifugao farming practices and introduce new ones that will protect civets and their forests . <p> Harvesting methods remain unchanged in Asipulo , coffee is still picked and processed by loving hands . <p> The biggest difference is that the new generation of farmers , look to the coffee beans on the forest floor and not the berries in the tree . <p> Beginning in June 2007 , Gerald Jr . was the first in Asipulo to harvest civet coffee , alongside his ordinary crop . While other farmers continued to throw away civet coffee , and hunt the ' crop destroying ' creature , Gerald Jr . promotes their survival and usefulness . <p> Gerald Jr . also rejects slash-and-burn techniques , which some coffee farmers still practice . <p> " We do n't like to ... follow their system of just open farming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting down the trees , we just plant coffee under them . " <p> Economic sense eventually won over local farmers . <p> Instead of collecting ordinary coffee and selling it wholesale to large companies , Asipulo farmers have tapped into the luxury civet coffee market abroad . <p> Gerald Jr . coordinates the sale of Asipulo civet coffee , exporting it directly to the US , Switzerland and Canada . <p> Civet coffee is also sold locally , well below international market prices . Arabica civet beans fetch $70 per 100g while Robusta civet beans sell for $40 per 100g . <p> Origin <p> The origins of civet coffee have gained mythical status , and date back to Dutch colonial Indonesia in the 18th century . <p> So the story goes , the Dutch forbid local plantation workers from picking coffee berries for their own use . <p> The Indonesian workers noticed that local civets consumed the berries and discarded the bean . Keen to try the exotic brew , locals collected civet coffee beans for themselves . <p> Long popular in Indonesia , civet coffee only emerged in international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many hands make light work , during the labor-intensive harvest season . <p> " In the community if you need help , they come and help . And you help them in return . " Gerald Jr . explains . <p> Once the civet coffee is collected , it is thoroughly washed and dried . It is then pounded in a mortar and pestle to separate the bean from the shell . <p> Beans are exported unroasted , while beans sold locally are roasted in a traditional charcoal and clay pot . <p> In November last year a quality test tasting of civet coffee was conducted in Switzerland . <p> The civet coffee market has been flooded with cheap civet coffee of dubious quality and authenticity . <p> Enterprising farmers across Southeast Asia have established caged-civet farms . <p> Caged civets are fed large amounts of coffee , only a small part of their diet in the wild , and farmers are able to produce much larger quantities for lower prices . <p> The Swiss event entitled ' Taste the Myth ' featured Philippine civet coffee from Asipulo , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Swiss Coffee scientist Dr. Chahan Yeretzian , among others . <p> Mild , full flavor <p> Dr. Yeretzian used a microscope to verify the civet coffee 's authenticity . Strittmatter admired the mild , full flavor . <p> While ordinary coffee has a bitter aftertaste , civet coffee is strong but smooth , its flavors linger on the tongue . <p> ' GoGi ' is the star of Gerald Jr . ' s civet rehabilitation center . When she was found in a hunter 's trap in February last year , she was half-starved and scared . <p> Now , the normally nocturnal animal spends her days wandering around her enclosure , attracting curious passersby . Gerald Jr . hopes to bring an end to all civet hunting in the community . <p> " If we know somebody who keeps a civet alive , we go and get them . But we do n't do it by force , of course we do n't want to break the social interaction with the community . " <p> Gerald Jr . often pays the hunter for injured civets and explains that preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience there are many civets who die because they are very sensitive , once they are injured it becomes worse if it is not treated and they soon will die . " <p> Gerald Jr . is optimistic about what the future holds . He wants to increase civet coffee production across Asipulo and promote local development . <p> The local community is increasingly concerned with environmental preservation . They believe the survival of the civet and fate of the community are intertwined . <p> " It 's about keeping the forest , and how to make profit from the resources of the forest , " says Gerald Jr .
