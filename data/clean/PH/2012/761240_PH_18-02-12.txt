The biggest difference is that the new generation of farmers , look to the coffee beans on the forest floor and not the berries in the tree .

While other farmers continued to throw away civet coffee , and hunt the ' crop destroying ' creature , Gerald Jr . promotes their survival and usefulness .  Gerald Jr . also rejects slash-and-burn techniques , which some coffee farmers still practice .  " We do n't like to ... follow their system of just open farming , cutting down the trees , we just plant coffee under them . "  Economic sense eventually won over local farmers .

Now , the normally nocturnal animal spends her days wandering around her enclosure , attracting curious passersby . Gerald Jr . hopes to bring an end to all civet hunting in the community .  " If we know somebody who keeps a civet alive , we go and get them . But we do n't do it by force , of course we do n't want to break the social interaction with the community .
