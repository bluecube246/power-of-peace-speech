<h> Calls for action in Hong Kong after study finds traffic noise could be threatening health <p> It 's a common phenomenon to feel like traffic in Hong Kong is draining your life force . <p> Whether you 're banging your head against a dashboard at gridlock , confused as to how a highway could possibly be crowded at 2pm on a Tuesday , or wondering which pagan god you offended to deserve a five-minute wait to cross the road , traffic sucks , plain and simple . <p> But , apparently , traffic might not just be a nuisance -- it could very well be slowly killing you . <p> A British study published today links noise pollution caused by traffic to negative affects on physical or mental health . <p> The study cited a link between noise pollution and an increased risk of strokes and death . <p> Among people aged 25 or older , death was four percent more common in areas with 60 decibels of traffic noise compared to areas with less than 55 decibels -- the standard set by the WHO as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to results from Hong Kong 's Environmental Protection Department from 2000 ( because they 've probably been too scared to measure since then ) , more than a million people in Hong Kong are exposed to noise levels higher than 70 decibels every day . <p> Good to know . Just imagine what those heavy-duty construction drills clock up in decibels . <p> Government officials have stated that Environmental Impact Assessments take noise into consideration , but are not focussed on the effect noise can have on health . <p> As there is currently no consensus on the relationship between heath and noise levels , it would be hard to make an argument for tighter regulations , reports the SCMP.
