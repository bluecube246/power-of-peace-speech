calls for action in hong kong after study finds traffic noise could be threatening health  it 's a common phenomenon to feel like traffic in hong kong is draining your life force .  whether you 're banging your head against a dashboard at gridlock , confused as to how a highway could possibly be crowded at 2pm on a tuesday , or wondering which pagan god you offended to deserve a five-minute wait to cross the road , traffic sucks , plain and simple .  but , apparently , traffic might not just be a nuisance -- it could very well be slowly killing you .  a british study published today links noise pollution caused by traffic to negative affects on physical or mental health .  the study cited a link between noise pollution and an increased risk of strokes and death .  among people aged 25 or older , death was four percent more common in areas with 60 decibels of traffic noise compared to areas with less than 55 decibels -- the standard set by the who as the according to results from hong kong 's environmental protection department from 2000 ( because they 've probably been too scared to measure since then ) , more than a million people in hong kong are exposed to noise levels higher than 70 decibels every day .  good to know . just imagine what those heavy-duty construction drills clock up in decibels .  government officials have stated that environmental impact assessments take noise into consideration , but are not focussed on the effect noise can have on health .  as there is currently no consensus on the relationship between heath and noise levels , it would be hard to make an argument for tighter regulations , reports the scmp.
