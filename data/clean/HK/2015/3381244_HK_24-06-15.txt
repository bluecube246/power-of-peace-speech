Hong Kong woman catches serial underwear thief neighbour with spy cam  A serial underwear thief has been uncovered in Hong Kong after his neighbour installed a spy camera following the mystery disappearance of several pairs of her drawers .

The knickers nicker was finally caught after his neighbour , surnamed Lee , asked her boyfriend to install a security camera outside her house which sent alerts to her mobile phone if any motion was detected .  She was at the police station reporting the theft of her underwear when the alarm went off again , showing Cheung coming back for a second helping .
