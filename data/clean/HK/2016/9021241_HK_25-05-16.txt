Among officials greeting him at the airport late today was U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy . Obama plans to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before joining his counterparts for a summit of the Group of Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Abe would raise the recent arrest of a former U.S. Marine in connection with the murder of a Japanese woman on the southern island of Okinawa . Obama also plans an historic visit Friday to Hiroshima , seven decades after the U.S. ushered in the nuclear age by dropping an atomic bomb to end World War II . Obama will be the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima . In Vietnam , Obama praised the next generation of leaders for being more conscious of the environment than previous ones and urged them to ? do something about ' ' climate change . During his final public event in Ho Chi Minh City , Obama basked in the admiration of hundreds of young leaders who participated in a town hall-style event and prefaced some of their questions to him with praise about his leadership and his ? inspiring speeches . ' ' In Ho Chi Minh City , Obama used a question about preserving a Vietnamese cave from development to pivot to climate change . He said Vietnam would be one of the countries seas . ? That could have a huge impact on Vietnam 's ability to feed its people , on fishermen , on farmers , and it could be a really big problem if we do n't do something about it , so it 's going to be up to you to start , ' ' he said . ? One of the great things about your generation is that you are already much more conscious about the environment than my generation was or previous generations were. ? ? He had told a previous questioner that he ? fooled around a lot ' ' when he was young and was n't serious about school . ? I was more into basketball and girls . I was n't always that serious . You 're already way ahead of me . That 's good . ' ' Obama also promoted a 12-nation , trans-Pacific trade pact that includes Vietnam but is stalled in the U.S. Congress and opposed by the three leading U.S. presidential candidates . But he avoided wading too deeply into politics when asked where he sees himself in five years , Obama has said on previous occasions that world leaders ask him all the time about the unpredictable election . ? Sometimes , our politics does n't express all the goodness of the people , but usually , eventually , the voters make good decisions and democracy works , ' ' Obama said . ? So I 'm optimistic that we 'll get through this period . ' ' As for his future , Obama said he expects to stay involved with public policy issues and return to his roots as an organizer . ? I 'll be like a community organizer , except a little more famous than I used to be . ' ' Obama spent three days in the capital of Hanoi , in the north , and in Ho Chi Minh City , in the south. ? AP
