<h> Students demand unconditional loans <p> By Abela Msikula <p> 10th January 2016 <p> Email <p> Print <p> Tanzania Higher Learning Institutions Students ' Organization ( TAHLISO ) has confirmed receipt of loans for 53,000 students for 2015/16 academic year , but 17,000 applicants awaiting documentation formalities are yet to receive a cent about three months into the first semester . <p> TAHLISO President , Stanslaus Peter called upon the students who missed loans due to failure to submit the required academic documents to the Higher Education Students ' Loans Board ( HESLB ) to immediately do so as the Board was ready to issue the funds . <p> " We met with the Board this week and we were assured the government has issued part of the funds , " he said , pledging that TAHLISO would make sure that all the qualified students had an access to loans . <p> Commending the Board for adhering to Treasury directives , Peter said it has already set a schedule to hear the cases surrounding few students who were denied loans . <p> He urged the board to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to loans , amid the prevailing confusion over relevant merits . <p> He said plans were underway for the organization to meet with relevant government bodies to press , among others , for unconditional access to loans to students of higher learning institutions irrespective of their educational , financial and family background , courses they pursue or pass grades . <p> Vice President Juma Omary said they would wage nationwide campaign to court new universities into pressing for the new liberal terms of accessing the loans . <p> But the controversial loan board got a new boss , Moses Katabaro last week who pledged to do away with strikes in universities , saying the best way for settlement of scores was through negotiations .
