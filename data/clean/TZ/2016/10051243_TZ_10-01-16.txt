students demand unconditional loans  by abela msikula  10th january 2016  email  print  tanzania higher learning institutions students ' organization ( tahliso ) has confirmed receipt of loans for 53,000 students for 2015/16 academic year , but 17,000 applicants awaiting documentation formalities are yet to receive a cent about three months into the first semester .  tahliso president , stanslaus peter called upon the students who missed loans due to failure to submit the required academic documents to the higher education students ' loans board ( heslb ) to immediately do so as the board was ready to issue the funds .  " we met with the board this week and we were assured the government has issued part of the funds , " he said , pledging that tahliso would make sure that all the qualified students had an access to loans .  commending the board for adhering to treasury directives , peter said it has already set a schedule to hear the cases surrounding few students who were denied loans .  he urged the board to ease to loans , amid the prevailing confusion over relevant merits .  he said plans were underway for the organization to meet with relevant government bodies to press , among others , for unconditional access to loans to students of higher learning institutions irrespective of their educational , financial and family background , courses they pursue or pass grades .  vice president juma omary said they would wage nationwide campaign to court new universities into pressing for the new liberal terms of accessing the loans .  but the controversial loan board got a new boss , moses katabaro last week who pledged to do away with strikes in universities , saying the best way for settlement of scores was through negotiations .
