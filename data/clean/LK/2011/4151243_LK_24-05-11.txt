<h> A look at SLPL team names <p> The news has taken Sri Lanka by storm and it seems to be the subject that comes up in all cricket circles I know of . No , it 's not the all important England tour which starts in a few days , it 's our own SL(I)PL ! I did n't include that ' I ' there by accident , I put it there because it 's our own copy of IPL . <p> As the news broke out , most cricket lovers were off guard and when they tried to find more information , they found almost nothing . No official logo , website , fixtures , broadcasters and there are older mushrooms that popped up in our backyard after the rains than the company that won the rights to organize the event . <p> Let 's look at the positives , our domestic players will make some money , earn some experience and it 'll be an opportunity for them to show their talent to the World . SLPL will have less drama compared to the IPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take much time . Pakistani players will get to have some fun . The crowds will be - well Sri Lankan - far relaxed and musical . <p> The obvious negatives will be the small budget , limited international talent available , the weather ( will be very tricky ) and all the games are going to be in Colombo . There 's also a possibility of multiple Lalit Modis with the abundance of ego filled politicians and cricket officials in Sri Lanka . <p> Then , the confusion : The biggest of all , will there be cheerleaders ? <p> Will Somerset Entertainment Ventures bring in Channa Wijewardena 's dancing troupe to cheer , or will it be the trio from the latest BnS cricket video ? <p> And the question that 's been bothering my light hearted friends , ' What the hell were they thinking when they came up with those team names ? ! ! ! ' <p> Basnahira Bears <p> As far as I know , the only place that you 'll come across a bear in the Western ( Basnahira ) Province is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I ca n't stop wondering if it would have been better if they picked something like ' Basnahira Bats ' or ' Basnahira Crows ' . Out of 91 species of mammals found in Sri Lanka , 11 are from the bat family plus it can also mean the cricket bat ( not an animal ) . About Crows , almost everyone in Sri Lanka knows about the cunning Colombo Crows so why not tell the world a few stories and promote a piece of our country ? <p> No need to be a zoologist to come up with these , but a good googlist . <p> Kadurata Kites <p> When one of my friends told me the names of the SLPL teams , I broke into laughter as I heard this one . I thought that ' Kites ' meant the type that kids fly at the Galle Face Green and I told my good friend to go fly a kite himself . But apparently , they named it after the type of birds , similar to Eagles . Why they did n't call the team ' Kadurata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name ' Kadurata Sambars ' would have sounded more exotic and most importantly made sense as Sri Lankan Sambars are endemic creatures . <p> Nagenahira Nagas <p> When the month of July comes , the word ' Nagas ' will be googled quite a lot . I do n't have much against this name , but they should have kept at least one part English . I 'm just glad that it did n't end up being something like ' Nagenahira Dugongs ' or ' Nagenahira Pandas ' . <p> Ruhuna Rhinos <p> Once again , anyone from the Southern Province needs to go to the national zoo to see a rhino or they can drink a few pots of toddy from Matara and go take a nap . A name like ' Ruhuna Blue Whales ' would have made more sense and also could have helped advertise Whale watching in Sri Lanka . <p> Uthura Oryxes <p> Antelopes ? I do n't know what the animal reflects about the Northern Province , but one thing I can tell is that the person who suggested these names went on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here comes the mythological creature ! I guess little girls of Uva province will be happy with their team name . I 'm sure that the players will feel quite special too ! A name like ' Uva Leopards ' would have fit in just fine . <p> Wayamba Wolves <p> This team went to the Champion 's League wearing a sponsors logo of a brand of condoms and lost all their matches and came back home in a hurry . They must have expected something like ' Wayamba Sperm Whales ' . Wayamba boys must be relieved , should n't get too comfortable though , organizers have n't picked the sponsors yet ! <p> Those are the teams and the names and what they could have been or even what they should have been . <p> Clearly , they just wanted the names to sound ' interesting ' , but they have failed miserably , in most cases . Instead , Somerset Entertainment Ventures should have aimed at uniqueness . <p> After all , Sri Lanka is a country that produced freaks to the cricketing world , who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotates so fast that you need thousand frames per second to catch it , small fiery fast bowlers with blonde curls that send in more accurate Yorkers than a bowling machine and batsmen with forearms of steel who could square cut sixes at will , or ones who were bold enough to wait for the ball until milliseconds before it hit their head and scoop it right over the wicket keeper . If I ever expected a world class league from Sri Lanka , I 'd have wanted it to be unique not a copy of the IPL rubbish . <p> A knock-out league with day-night , four-day cricket matches played with a pink ball would have been more Sri Lankan , because that 's what Sri Lanka has brought into the arena over decades , things that are original , true and absolutely amazing ! <p> Like the IPL , this tournament 's primary aim is not to showcase the world 's cricketing talent and provide entertainment , it is to generate money . I do n't particularly have a problem with that as the BCCSL could use the income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they did n't , it would add a sense of integrity to it , which like the IPL , it does n't deserve .
