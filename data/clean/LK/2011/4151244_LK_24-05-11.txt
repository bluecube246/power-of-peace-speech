dressed in a contrasting turquoise barbara tfank dress and pink bolero , mrs. obama stood out while standing alongside the queen , who wore a matching floral dress suit with a light blue hat and camilla , the duchess of cornwall , who donned a cream dress and jacket with a matching hat by philip treacy , during the official welcoming ceremony at buckingham palace .  while headpieces are not by any means required when meeting the queen , wearing one could be interpreted as a sign of respect to the british monarch . samantha cameron , wife of the bristish prime minister , was severely criticized in the uk for not wearing a hat to the royal wedding last month .  france 's first lady carla bruni-sarkozy wore an understated , grey pillbox hat when she and husband french president nicolas sarkoz , arrived for their state visit to britain back in 2008 .  hat or no hat , mrs. obama 's choice outfit was consistent with her personal style : cheerful with bold mix-and-match elements .
