<p> Dressed in a contrasting turquoise Barbara Tfank dress and pink bolero , Mrs. Obama stood out while standing alongside the Queen , who wore a matching floral dress suit with a light blue hat and Camilla , the Duchess of Cornwall , who donned a cream dress and jacket with a matching hat by Philip Treacy , during the official welcoming ceremony at Buckingham Palace . <p> While headpieces are not by any means required when meeting the Queen , wearing one could be interpreted as a sign of respect to the British monarch . Samantha Cameron , wife of the Bristish prime minister , was severely criticized in the UK for not wearing a hat to the royal wedding last month . <p> France 's first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy wore an understated , grey pillbox hat when she and husband French president Nicolas Sarkoz , arrived for their state visit to Britain back in 2008 . <p> Hat or no hat , Mrs. Obama 's choice outfit was consistent with her personal style : cheerful with bold mix-and-match elements .
