Editorial Courtesy The Island  April 27 , 2016 , 8:27 pm Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader and Joint Opposition firebrand Udaya Gammanpila has challenged newly appointed IGP Pujith Jayasundara to arrest Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for ' forcibly entering ' an army camp in Kilinochchi on April 16 . Gammanpila is being very na ? ve . The IGP can not do so for obvious reasons .  Sampanthan is a member of the Constitutional Council ( CC ) which selected Jayasundara as the IGP without following any procedure or rules , which , to begin with , are conspicuous by their absence . How can the new IGP act against any of the CC members who voted for him ? Second , arresting the Opposition Leader is a tall order for an IGP who has even failed to nab those who recently demolished a multi-million-rupee walking track near the Wattala police station .  The Opposition Leader and other TNA politicians have denied that they forced themselves into the army camp concerned . They insist that the barrier at the entrance to the military facility was denied by the army . However , the fact remains that nobody must enter a military camp without obtaining permission for two reasons . First , they must abide by the law . Second , they must not run the risk of being shot dead .  There are times when the TNA 's reaction to certain issues assumes a theatrical hue . It behoves Tamil politicians representing democratic parties to act responsibly without resorting to anything that might serve the purpose of sinister elements now in suspended animation .  TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran has told this newspaper that he , Sampanthan and others entered the camp premises because some houses therein had not been returned to their owners . Why the army continues to occupy houses belonging to civilians some of whom are said to be languishing in temporary shelters defies comprehension . It is nearly seven years since the war ended and those houses must be returned to their original owners without further delay .  There is a positive side to the Kilinochchi incident . TNA politicians did not dare go anywhere near LTTE camps without relations with the Tigers . But , they have driven into an army camp without fear of being shot while demonising the military !  One may not try to question Gammanpila 's right to demand police action against those involved in the Kilinochchi incident . But , the question is why there were no such strident calls for arrests when a bunch of savage fanatics unleashed violence against the Muslims in Aluthgama in 2014 . If Gammanpila and others of his ilk had campaigned for arresting the perpetrators of Aluthgama violence , perhaps they would not have had to run around like headless chickens today in a bid to re-enthrone Mahinda Rajapaksa , who lost the last presidential election mainly because he had alienated the Muslim voters .  Meanwhile , Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has rhetorically asked the media whether arrests help solve problems . Paradoxical as it may sound the answer is both ' yes ' and ' no ' . Arrests may not help solve the problems people are faced with , but they do certainly enable politicians to tackle issues that trouble them .  the last presidential election that the leaders of the previous government had helped themselves to public funds to the tune of USD 18 bn . If this staggering amount of forex said to be stashed away overseas could be brought back the country 's economic woes would disappear in no time . Several politicians and their bureaucratic lackeys were arrested and detained , but not a single stolen dollar has so far been recovered . Instead , the government is squeezing the public dry to raise funds to tide it over .  However , arrests have helped the government neutralise some of its political enemies . After being detained for many moons , an ex-MP described by the champions of good governance as the former ruling clan 's collector has switched his allegiance to the government ; he is said to be singing like a canary now . Moreover , he has been appointed one of the organisers of the SLFP 's May Day rally in Galle . One problem less for the government !
