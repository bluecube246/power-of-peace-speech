<h> Dedicated to the Girl Child <p> October 6 , 2016 , 9:19 pm <p> October is a special month for children . It dawns with the World Children 's Day ( which falls on October 1 ) . It is also the national reading month , back to back the national literary month ( which is September ) , encourage children to " read to conquer the world " all the books they were gifted with the previous month . And since 2012 , world celebrates the International Day of the Girl Child on October 11 , thus bringing the special needs of the girl child to the forefront . <p> Background <p> On December 19 , 2011 , United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/170 to declare October 11 as the International Day of the Girl Child , to recognize girls ' rights and the unique challenges girls face around the world . <p> The International Day of the Girl Child focuses attention on the need to address the challenges girls face and to promote girls ' empowerment and the fulfillment of their human rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's International Day of the Girl ( 11 October ) is Girls ' Progress = Goals ' Progress : A Global Girl Data Movement . <p> Adolescent girls have the right to a safe , educated , and healthy life , not only during these critical formative years , but also as they mature into women . If effectively supported during the adolescent years , girls have the potential to change the world -- both as the empowered girls of today and as tomorrow 's workers , mothers , entrepreneurs , mentors , household heads , and political leaders . An investment in realizing the power of adolescent girls upholds their rights today and promises a more equitable and prosperous future , one in which half of humanity is an equal partner in solving the problems of climate change , political conflict , economic growth , disease prevention , and global sustainability . <p> As the global community launches the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) for implementation over the next 15 years , it is a good time to recognize the achievements made in supporting young girls , while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of adolescent girls , to truly fulfill their potential as key actors in achieving a sustainable and equitable world . ( UN communiqu ? ) <h> Maithree Bawana -- for the safety of all <p> By Darshi ( via email ) <p> It is with interest I read the article on " In-flight mindfulness : Meditation while travelling " that appeared in the " Health &amp; Society " of 23.09.2016 . This is a very helpful article for those who are stressed while travelling . <p> I practice Maithree Bawana and thought I would share my story with you . This form of meditation is very soothing and can even transform your personality in a positive way . <p> The background to Maithree Bawana pursued by me is as follows . I used to think about how people were so engrossed in themselves , their children etc. to the extent that the well being of others just simply did n't count . For example close to the exams of your child , you will go and make vows and seek blessings for your children to pass , or pray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is away on a trip or is late coming home in the night . What about the safety of the children of your friends , colleagues and others all over the world ? Children are the most innocent and beautiful , but what about their well being and safety ? Is it only your child that has to be safe and do well ? <p> Having this in mind , I started meditating for the happiness , health and well being of all humans , that there will be peace among all human beings , that all human beings will be blessed . These are the vibrations I send , while travelling in heavy traffic , before going to sleep etc. for example while I go to work or when returning from work ( driven by my driver ) when I see a couple on a motor bike with a child , or I see a boy recklessly riding a motor bike , I sent positive thoughts for the safety and well being of the family in case of the former and also safety of the latter adding that he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so recklessly . In this manner , when I see people on the road , I close my mind and send positive vibrations of health safety and well being to them . <p> When I hear of a patient who is seriously ill , I send these positive vibrations for his or her well being , I 've done it through the night while awake and semi awake . I do n't claim to have magical powers but I have seen that all those times the patients have come out of it . Maybe it was a coincidence.It has also made a stress free , calm and peaceful atmosphere for me . So I like to believe that not only me but all the living beings the world over have benefited by my positive thoughts sent to the universe . <h> Reducing the Ages of Marriage and Consent -- To be or Not to be <p> While Sri Lanka celebrates the International Day of the Girl Child on October 11 , a matter concerning the girl child hinges on policy level , with a possible undertone of U-turning the achievements hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the existing ages of marriage and consent . <p> According to Sri Lankan law , the legal age of marriage stands at 18 for both girls and boys . The age for consent for girls is 16 , thus indulging in sexual intercourse with a girl less than 16 years , even with her consent amounts to statutory rape in Sri Lanka , for which the liability is a jail term amounting up to 10 years . <p> Commenting on the issue Dr. Deepika Udagama , Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka ( HRCSL ) , recalled the history behind the move to increase the ages of marriage and consent from 16 to 18 years and from 14 to 16 years , respectively . <p> " It was in 1995 that the laws pertaining to these ages were increased via amendments to the penal code . At that time there were lot of concerns about issues like teenage pregnancies and child abuse . Lot of consultations were made with medical professionals , child psychologists etc. prior to this move . This whole issue was about increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her own life . In my opinion this is an issue not to be settled by lawyers or policy makers in isolation , but by medical professionals . This is a medical issue and involves understanding child 's health , wellbeing and psychology " , Dr. Udagama who was an ardent proponent of the issue since way back in the early 90s captured the antecedent factors that led to the 1995 law amendment succinctly . <p> Dr. Udagama remarking on the capacity of a girl child to make correct decisions about sexuality . " What is the right age a child can make a decision about sexual activity ? She would fully appreciate the consequences of having sexual relations ? Consequences on one 's own life , education , burden of bringing up a child " , thus reiterating the importance of a girl being able to make correct decisions about her life . <p> She further highlighted the importance " reproductive health " for adolescents . <p> " We do n't talk about sexual relations in open . We do n't have proper reproductive health education for our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large , teachers were reluctant to talk about " sex " . There were interventions by parents . They did n't like this subject being discussed in schools . The point is , this is about life , to prepare these youngsters to face complex situations in life " . <p> Commenting on children 's eagerness to " learn about the secrets of life " in sly , Dr. Udagama noted , " Yet the children are constantly communicating about these things in facebook , mobiles etc . Even in the most remote places in the country , the modes of communication are readily available , accessible and instantaneous " . <p> Marriage is no solution <p> Surfacing laxity of present law and the tendency to see marriage as the only way out for an underage girl once pregnant , Dr. Udagama identifying the " hazy area " between the ages of 16 and 18 commented , " If the girl is less than 16 it is statutory rape and carries a minimum penalty of 10 year imprisonment under the penal code . Here the consent is irrelevant as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the girl is between 16 and 18 , then the parents face a difficulty in giving the daughter in marriage to the " rapist " as the minimum age of marriage is 18 . This is one reason for the " push " to bring the age of marriage down " . <p> Bringing research experience to good use Dr. Udagama commented , " Here I 'm speaking in the capacity of an academic who have studied this issue for years . The problem arises because we envisage marriage to be the solution to this problem . The salvation for parents and everybody lies in marrying off the girl . But the question is to whom ? He could be a man who is not ready to marry . He may have just wanted to have fun . He could be already a married man . He could be a very young boy himself . So , how can marriage be the solution ? " <p> Reproductive health -- the solution <p> Dr. Udagama further elaborated , " In my opinion , the solution to the problem is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant about this issue . People do n't know the difference between the age of consent and the age of marriage . That is because our traditional understanding that one would have sexual relations when once married only . But obviously the reality is far from that . These laws were brought in not to preserve any cultural norms or whatever , but to address the reality and protect the girl child " . <p> She further added , " You should try to regulate it through law to protect those who are ignorant about it and to bring in a sense of responsibility about the issue " . <p> Dr. Udagama emphasized , " There should be a good public campaign to educate the parents and the community at large , about the consequence of teenage pregnancies and other social consequences . That might not prevent people from having sex . But they will understand the consequences . It will tell young people to be responsible about themselves , and to protect themselves . <p> Elaborating on the need of good support systems to address the issue , " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how we are going to look after her in the society . Can she continue to have education ? What are the support systems available for her ? In fact two children in this case - the new born child and the child mother . What would be the available system to support the girl if she gives up education in favour of marriage ? What are the vocational training possibilities available for her ? These are the things now we have to look at as a compassionate society . Not in a manner blinded by ancient traditions " . <p> The need of a monitoring system <p> Counting on her wealth of experience Dr. Udagama brought in another hitherto less talked about dimension of the problem to the fore , " On the other hand , who will monitor whether the support systems will continue , even after the girl is given in marriage her ability to fulfill her life ? Thus we need a good monitoring system to ensure that the support systems will continue " . <p> Putting the icing on the cake Dr. Udagama was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a problem with these ages 16 and 18 . Both should remain as they are . I do n't see any contradiction there " . <p> So much so that on the same lines Dr. Natasha Balendra , chairperson National Child Protection Authority ( NCPA ) opined the need to maintain the law related to minimum age of marriage and consent as they are at present . Already shouldering the burden of protecting the children from all forms of harm , from verbal , physical to sexual along a long continuum , Dr. Balendra tended to see the ground realities . " There could be certain difficulties at the ground level due to teenage pregnancies and girls between the ages of 16 and 18 eloping with men . With regard to the girls between the ages of 16 and 18 , as they can not get married legally , there are many social issues they face in terms of financial security and social repercussions of having an illegitimate child " . <p> Yet Dr. Balendra opined , " Bringing the age of marriage down will have a very negative impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on girl 's education prospects , career prospects , on her associations with peers . And also our research has shown that these early marriages do n't last long . They tend to break early . Also there is a greater incidence of violence , both sexual and physical " . <p> With regard to the age of consent Dr. Balendra stressed the importance of recognizing the evolving capacity of children , and specially the girls . Thus , she saw it as , " A case of empowering the girls to make the right decisions " . She added that , " A large majority of child abuse cases that are prosecuted are in fact statutory rape cases . So when we talk about delays and backlog of cases , and if we increase the age of consent we could see that the number of these cases increasing exponentially . Thus , we should have legal changes that address the issues people face at the ground level " . <p> Also stressing on the importance of adhering to bright line rule with regard to statutory rape Dr. Balendra observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , it is of paramount importance sticking to the bright line rule without any discretion . In the case of underage children , attempts to bringing down the age of marriage and marrying off the " victimized " child will be futile as marriage is not the panacea for this complex social problem " . <p> Empower the girl child <p> Dr. Balendra reiterating the importance of education and empowerment of the girl child , " What we suggest really are the things like educating on reproductive and sexual health and contraception . We need to educate the young people to make their own choices without succumbing to pressures , pressures to engage in sex . The girls need to be empowered on matters relating to their sexuality " . <p> Even Dr. Balendra saw that " early marriage " is not the answer to the problem of a girl of 16 to 18 year age group becoming pregnant . " Sri Lanka , among the South Asian countries , has one of the lowest rates of early marriage . Therefore bringing the minimum age of marriage down will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have gained in terms of social and health development . Even in the cases where the girl is pregnant , bringing the age of marriage down will not solve the problem as marriage is not the solution to this problem . There are number of negative consequences of marriage these girls could face . These include the loss of their capacity to have education , in formal schools or in vocational training " . <p> Advocating an attitudinal change in society , she stressed the need of " educating the society not to treat these girls and their children as " pariahs " . <p> Social interventions <p> Stressing the need for social intervention Dr. Balendra envisaged the need to focus on the parents and the less privileged segments of the society . " Many of these children could be from low income families . Their parents could be from low education backgrounds thus triggering a vicious cycle . So , awareness generation among these parents about the closeness and intimacy with their children too need to be inculcated " . <p> On one last note Dr. Balendra identified opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention , sans laying hands on the current benchmarks relating to age of marriage and consent , as the viable options for addressing the " unmet needs " of adolescent health in Sri Lanka .
