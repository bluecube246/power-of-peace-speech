Significant evidence that the flavored tobacco products sales ban successful in New York City  A study conducted by Dr. Shannon M. Farley , New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention and Tobacco Control , reveals that flavoured tobacco product sales and odds of ever using flavoured tobacco products or using any tobacco products among teens have declined significantly after ban enforcement began .  Collectively these findings demonstrate significant evidence that the flavoured tobacco products sales ban was successful in New York City and could succeed elsewhere .  The availability of flavoured tobacco products is associated with increased initiation and youth smoking . New York City prohibited all sales of flavoured cigars , cigarillos , little cigars , chew , snuff , tobacco , pipe tobacco , roll-your-own tobacco , and dissolvable , excluding menthol , in October , 2009 . The enforcement began in November 2010 .  This paper describes the sales ban evaluation .  Data on retail tobacco sales of cigars , smokeless and other tobacco products such as pipe tobacco and roll-your-own changes in flavoured and non-flavoured tobacco product inflation-adjusted dollar sales overall , and by product type . Changes in ever use of flavoured tobacco products , any tobacco product use , and smoking prevalence among adolescents were estimated using multivariable logistic regression .
