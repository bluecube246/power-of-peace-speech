<h> Relevance of surgical strikes <p> October 6 , 2016 , 9:14 pm <p> Indian troops in action <p> By Kuldip Nayar <p> I opposed the surgical strikes across the Line of Control in retaliation to the terror strike at the Army camp in Uri because I thought it would escalate matters and get to a point of no return . But now that the strikes have been conducted , I back the government . Do n't forget , George Bernard Shaw , who called himself the worst critic of the British government , supported it when it was in the midst of war . <p> India , in all likelihood , had no option . The terrorists taking shelter on Pakistan 's soil and operating from there had to be punished as Islamabad has not done anything to foil their activities . In the aftermath of the surgical strikes and India 's public acknowledgement of them , Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said his country would retaliate . The attack near Baramulla area was maybe what he meant by revenge . <p> India 's Chief of Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the response to the Uri attack that has claimed 20 Indian soldiers is not yet over and the situation " is still live " , while remaining mum on the surgical strikes . I do n't think either India or Pakistan , both nuclear powers , will cross the red line . However , escalation on the border can be controlled only up to a point and if the situation snowballs it is difficult to say what will happen on the war theatre . <p> The National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan , Ajit Doval and Nasser Janjua , respectively , have spoken and agreed to bring down tension . Why could n't they have done it before the surgical strikes took place ? Janjua must have gauged the depth of anger in India with all political parties backing the Narendra Modi government . Nawaz Sharif , who had convened a special meeting to apprise the Opposition of the situation , too , has got sanction from all political parties in Pakistan to respond appropriately . Opinion among the movers and shakers in both countries has become hawkish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear war if it comes to that . However , common people on both sides want an end to the daily tension and hope their governments will ensure that they do not live in constant fear . <p> The SAARC summit would have been an occasion to hammer out things across the table . But most of the regional bloc 's members have pulled out of the meeting at Islamabad , saying that the climate is not conducive for SAARC to meet . And there is no other venue where all countries in the region could have met and discussed the situation threadbare . <p> Pakistan should realise that countries in the region are increasingly wary of the carte blanche given to terrorists like Hafiz Sayeed who are openly operating from Pakistani soil . In the case of the Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar , supposed mastermind of the Pathankot attack , India took the case to the UN but China , Pakistan 's ally , used its veto power to extend its technical hold on New Delhi 's move to get him designated a terrorist . It was an unfortunate use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand by its ally . <p> As a result , the deadlock continues . The situation can escalate to dangerous proportions because Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif can at any time be overridden by the Army which is directing operations from its headquarters at Rawalpindi . <p> Pakistan also has to deal with the uprising in Balochistan and the attacks from Afghanistan . Since both do not have a full-fledged army to back them , the war would be a limited one . No doubt , the Americans have withdrawn their troops from Afghanistan but a small contingent has stayed back at the specific request of Kabul . New Delhi is now openly supporting Baloch leader Brahamdagh Bugti , who has sought asylum in India . Following his example , many Balochis who are residing in Europe and elsewhere will seek to come to India . This will open another front against Pakistan which India can utilise to tell the world that the uprising in Balochistan was like the one in East Pakistan , which liberated itself to become Bangladesh in 1971 . The Baloch rebellion is a warning to Islamabad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Frontier Gandhi , was from the Pushto region . When I met him years ago his complaint was that Jawaharlal Nehru had not kept his promise to establish an independent country for the Pushto-speaking people . Nehru was helpless because Balochistan was part of Pakistan and he had accepted the establishment of Pakistan at the time of Partition . Badshah Khan , as Frontier Gandhi was called , was now a citizen of Pakistan . Any step from Nehru would have amounted to war and he naturally was not prepared for it . <p> Prime Minister Modi is a different kettle of fish . Yet , his policy so far has been give-and-take . He invited leaders of all SAARC countries for his swearing-in ceremony . Modi also stopped over at Lahore while returning from Afghanistan to wish Sharif on his birthday and attend a family wedding despite the furore at home . However , now the situation on the ground is different and may force Modi to look at things from another perspective . <p> The surgical strikes are one option which he has exercised . Sharif 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Modi may not be able to control things when events take over . It 's time that Pakistan pulls itself back from the abyss . <p> After all , Pakistan should know by now that after having fought three wars -- in 1948 , 1965 and 1971Rs its loss was far greater than what it inflicted on India . It had to seek the good offices of President Clinton to get the Pakistani soldiers , who had infiltrated India Territory , back from the Kargil heights in the 1990s.
