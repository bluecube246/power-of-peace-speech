mar 22 , colombo : sri lanka plans to increase the production of ethanol in the country to reduce the amount of ethanol imported for the manufacture of alcohol and pharmaceuticals .  the cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal put forward by the president in his capacity as the minister of finance and planning to submit a gazette notification to parliament under the imports and exports ( control ) act for approval to increase production and reduce imports of ethanol .  the government says following the take-over of the pelawatte sugar industries and sevenagala sugar industries by the government , the production of sugar and sugar related products such as ethanol has increased .  sri lanka earlier this month banned ethanol imports since the country has an excess production of ethanol and also due to the decline of demand for locally produced ethanol .  the government in 2011 acquired the privately-owned pelawatte and sevenagala sugar factories that were not performing up to government 's expectations under the expropriation act enacted in november 2011.
