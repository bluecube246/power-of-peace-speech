<p> Mar 22 , Colombo : Sri Lanka plans to increase the production of ethanol in the country to reduce the amount of ethanol imported for the manufacture of alcohol and pharmaceuticals . <p> The cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal put forward by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning to submit a gazette notification to Parliament under the Imports and Exports ( Control ) Act for approval to increase production and reduce imports of ethanol . <p> The government says following the take-over of the Pelawatte Sugar Industries and Sevenagala Sugar Industries by the government , the production of sugar and sugar related products such as ethanol has increased . <p> Sri Lanka earlier this month banned ethanol imports since the country has an excess production of ethanol and also due to the decline of demand for locally produced ethanol . <p> The government in 2011 acquired the privately-owned Pelawatte and Sevenagala sugar factories that were not performing up to government 's expectations under the Expropriation Act enacted in November 2011.
