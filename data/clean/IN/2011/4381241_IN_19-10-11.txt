7,000 people in queue from 3 am to get swimming pool membership form  mumbai : the early bird catches the worm . an overwhelming 7,000 people lined up as early as 3 am yesterday , in order to buy membership forms that would give them access to dips in the newly renovated , state-of-the-art mahatma gandhi smarak municipal swimming pool complex in dadar .  the unprecedented turnout baffled officials . of the 10,000 available forms , 6,000 have already been sold .  the serpentine queue began in front of the pool gate , and stretched on as far as the eye could see .  the 6,000 water babies who managed to procure membership forms have thus staked their claim to use of the 10-lane olympic-size swimming pool , and the neighbouring cluster of three more pools -- one being a 16-ft deep pool built exclusively for diving , the second being a recreational pool , and the third a shallow one for kids to dip and wade in .  the pool complex is also equipped with a spectator 's gallery which has under renovation for the past two years .  this means that in the next four days of form-selling process , only 4,000 more forms can be sold . deputy municipal commissioner ( gardens and security ) s karavande said , " keeping the capacity of the pool in mind , we had decided to give out 10,000 new memberships. 6,000 forms have already been sold . we expect all the forms to be sold off on the second day itself . we can not release more forms .
