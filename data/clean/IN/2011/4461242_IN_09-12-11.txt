<p> It is clear in the first 10 minutes of the film that in terms of acting you 're not getting anything at all from anyone . So you settle down for a good laugh and whatever little else that the movie will throw your way . But Ye stupid Pyar is not kind to anyone , it is bad throughout and leaves you emotionally scarred . <p> Now before we get into anything else let 's get the " story " out of the way ( it has to be done ) . Abhishek ( Jatin Khurana ) back from his high profile MNC job in US for two weeks meets salsa instructor Neha ( Noopur Patwardhan ) at a gym . It 's love at first sight for him . They soon get married and plan to move to America . But Neha emotionally blackmails him into moving to Bangkok instead . Once they reach Bangkok Neha leaves Abhishek for her boyfriend ( at this point you cross your fingers and wish " Oh lord let this be it . Let the movie end here " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his college best friend Simran ( Akansha Shivhare ) to find the run-away bride . <p> The biggest question here is , why did she need to marry someone at all in order to get to Bangkok ? If the plan was to run away all along then why not straight from home ? <p> Bollywood has gone back to the dark ages if such films are still being made . As far as casting is concerned , Jatin and Noopur have no acting skills to speak of and the only person who shows even an ounce of potential is Akansha . Sahil Vaid as Multiplex ... well let 's just say the whole tradition of bringing in a character to just provide the audience with some comic relief went out of fashion some time ago , and for a reason . <p> The dialogues and the dialogue delivery , both , are laughable and can be best described as " cheesy " . Every time Jatin goes " oh mom " with love and emotion you want to hit yourself on the head with something heavy because even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple gets " drunk " is worth a mention . Their slurred speech and drunken talk is fake to the point of being sad . Clearly neither of them has ever even touched alcohol . <p> The film also fails cinematographically . There are too many shots that are out of focus and grainy to be allowed . Even the dubbing is inconsistent . <p> This film 's sole aim was to launch Jatin and Noopur as actors but this specific enterprise will hardly do much for their careers . The failure of Ye Stupid Pyar can not be blamed on just the lead pair , which would be a wee bit unfair . It was a team effort . <p> Final verdict , watch Ye Stupid Pyar at your own risk , or do n't watch it at all .
