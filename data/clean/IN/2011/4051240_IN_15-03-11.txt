<p> Grumpy aged men now have a good reason to cheer up -- they 'll outlive optimists , says a study . <p> Researchers have found that being cantankerous is the key to reaching old age -- this is because happier characters are likely to take more risks through their lives including eating unhealthy foods , drinking and smoking . <p> The findings , part of a 90-year study , cast doubt on reports that loving marriages , active social lives , raising children or owning a pet help people to live longer , the ' Daily Express ' reported . <p> Researcher Leslie Martin said : " We came to a new understanding about happiness and health . One of the findings that astounded us was that participants who were the most cheerful and had the best sense of humour as children lived shorter lives , on average , than those who were less cheerful . <p> " The prudent and persistent individuals stayed healthiest and lived longest .
