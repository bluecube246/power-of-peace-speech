Photo : Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint  Since the launch of her brand Rachana Reddy Accessories in 2010 , Rachana Reddy and her signature wooden clutch , with splashes of texture and colours , have become easily recognizable across Bangalore . With a debut at the Lakme Fashion Week , Summer/Resort 2011 in Mumbai and her products , a mix of samples from her best-selling lines The Lotus Sutra and The Global Gypsy , being called for possible retail out of three Paul Smith stores , two in London and one in Paris , it has been an exciting year for this young Bangalore designer . We peeked into her closet to see what defines her personal style . Edited excerpts from an interview :  What dominates your wardrobe ?  A bracelet she bought in the US .

Sadly , I have to wait for occasions to wear dresses and they do n't usually constitute daily wear . I enjoy wearing block-coloured shift dresses . They are versatile , look elegant and make a great canvas for me to experiment with accessorizing . I pick them in all kinds of cuts but currently I like the high-neck structured shift dresses . Mango and Asos.com have some great ones . If you look away from the dresses , you 'd find pants that I team with a variety of tops and shirts in my wardrobe . Then there are shoes . I have n't really counted , but I 'd guess there are a hundred pairs .  What do you wear on a regular day ?  I am mostly in the workshop designing things , so I wear pants and a top . Mostly cotton pants or some regular denims that are comfortable . When I get out My signature would be to wear something in a block colour and then dress it up with a loud accessory , like some big earrings or a loud neck piece . I tend to experiment with Indian jewellery and Western wear .  I hardly ever shop in Bangalore . There are new malls coming up that are looking good , but in the past year I have become a compulsive , impulsive online shopper . I have shopped a bit on Indian websites , their customer service can be a misery . I do n't really like Fashionandyou.com because their delivery is unreliable , but am addicted to this UK website called Asos.com . It 's a good collection and they have free shipping worldwide . I like Pret-amoda.com in India , which is more focused on designer wear . But since I love High Street brands , I am eagerly waiting for a good site that offers the best ones on one platform . I also get some dresses made by this tailor down the road . I like Charles &amp; Keith for bags . My D&amp;G shoes are those as a gift .  But do you find the right sizes online ?  Since I lived in London for a year when I studied at the London College of Fashion , I know my UK sizes . The fit of these dresses is often not perfect but then we are blessed with local tailors who will fix anything with a tuck here and there .  You job requires networking , so you must attend a lot of social events ? How do you dress for a night out ?  She pairs these earrings with Western wear . Photo : Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint  That 's where I end up wearing all the dresses . I keep them simple so I can accessorize . Bangaloreans do n't usually experiment too much but they dress smart . If I am at a party where I am just standing around or dancing , I 'd wear a short dress . For a more business-like social event , I 'd wear something that is more comfortable , like a pair of pants with a tube top . In Bangalore I am so I leave all my experimentation to when I am travelling to other cities such as Mumbai or Delhi .
