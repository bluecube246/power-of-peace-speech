<h> Bangalore : Nursery seats for Rs 4 lakh ? <p> Bangalore : It is that time of year when parents can be seen running from pillar to post , with creased brows , in the endeavour to secure a seat for their child at a good school . <p> However , a seat in a good school these days comes with a hefty price tag . <p> While a parent would likely have had to pay less than Rs 5,000 to get their ward into a good school a decade ago , the ongoing rate is anywhere between a whopping Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh . <p> Parents continue to bear the brunt as schools continue to ' fleece ' them of their hard earned money . One of them , requesting anonymity , alleged that she had paid to get her child admitted in a well-known school in the heart of the city . <p> She said , " Agents have a commission arrangement with school authorities and they sold nursery class seats for Rs 4 lakh this academic year . " When contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The want for seats in good schools has created a market for agents , who work on commission basis for each seat sold . <p> MiD-DAY contacted one such agent who agreed to sell this reporter a seat for nothing less than Rs 5 lakh at a premium international school . Explaining his business , he said , " We earn all year round as people drop out of school midway and our maximum income comes from NRI families and families who 've just moved to the city . " <p> These agents usually target online forums where parents address their problems about school admissions and donations . <p> Commenting on the matter , Primary and Secondary Education Minister , Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri clarified , " There are rules in place and schools have to adhere to them . In case parents have complaints , they should address it through the right channel . " <p> Even though one approaches through the right channel , it 's money that matters the most . A parent said that they are all too aware that the answer to the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very decisive in securing a seat for their child . <p> " School interviews always include a simple question - how much donation can we pay , " said the parent . This was a point that most parents agreed to . Many claim that an interview for a seat at almost every school , invariably ended if they quoted less that Rs 50,000 as donation . <p> We first headed to a school on St Marks Road to investigate whether this was true . Over the years , this school has been the centre point of the donation controversy , always skirting the topic . This reporter spoke to some hopeful parents waiting to attend the second round of the admission interview . <p> " If you can pay anything above Rs 1 lakh , then your admission process would be smooth . They charge only Rs 30,000 on paper , but ask for a huge sum under different categories , " said K R Ramamurthy , a parent . <p> When contacted , the school authorities refuted the allegations . <p> Some parents informed that the so-called categories include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were part of the donation . <p> Educationist M S Sridhar explains , " The situation has worsened in the last few years . I strongly believe that if a school has been built on a government land , like Bishop Cottons Boys School , then there is no need to collect donations . Yet amounts ranging between Rs 1 lakh and to Rs 3 lakh are still being collected , which middle class families can not afford . " <p> When contacted , principal of Bishop Cottons Boys School , John K Zachariah denied all allegations and said , " We do n't charge any donation at all . We just ask for infrastructure development fees and that is completely legal . The ISCE board permits schools under their purview to demand any amount from the students . " <p> Next , we headed to the Sophia High School where a group of parents awaited the fate of their respective wards outside the school . <p> " They do n't ask for it openly , but subtly slip it in during the interview process . I had to pay Rs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have to pay around Rs 1.25 lakh to get my second child into kindergarten now , " claimed one parent requesting anonymity .
