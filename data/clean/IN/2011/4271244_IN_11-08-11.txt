<p> www.enguide.in guides students to their required courses offered at different institutions Mukesh Venu <p> On Aug 11 , 2011 <p> After completing his +2 course , Adhun wanted to join the Computer Science ( CS ) stream for his B.Tech . But based on a mere assumption , he thought it was unlikely to get a seat for that particular stream in the college he wanted to . So Adhun had do with another course that was offered , only to find out later , that he could very well have got a seat in CS , in the college of his choice . Four years on , that memory is still fresh in Adhun 's mind . <p> " I did n't want anyone else to go through the dilemma that I had to after my +2 . That made me develop this concept of allotment predictor , " says Adhun Anand . The new site ' www.enguide.in ' , was thus conceived and created by Adhun Anand , and Kiran Lal , his classmate at college . It guides students to their required courses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Adhun 's brother Arjun , a software professional . <p> " At present , the site offers course details , college details , and of course the allotment predictor , " explains Adhun . " Regarding the colleges , contact details including phone numbers , email , website the courses offered in that particular college and the university to which it is affiliated can be obtained through ' enguide ' . A short summary about the nature of a particular course , the topics covered , the job opportunities that could be had by learning that course , etc. , are also given . " <p> But what makes ' enguide ' unique is the allotment predictor . " To gain access to this site the student has to complete and submit the registration form . His personal details , including the rank he has scored in the entrance tests are required to be filled . Based on the student 's rank , and the last rank to which the seat aspired by the student was allotted to in the previous year is compared , and the probability of obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite accurately with all colleges , except for the top two or three , because the fluctuation rate there is comparatively high . " <p> Adhun with ' enguide ' team <p> It is for the first time that an aspiring student gets to know about the chances he or she has in obtaining the seat they desire in a particular college . No wonder the site is a big hit among students with over 20,000 page views in less than a month since the site was launched . It also has about 1,000+ registered members from Trivandrum alone . <p> " Currently our focus is on Trivandrum city alone . But we will soon be expanding to other cities and towns as well , " adds Adhun . And this young man has no plans to slow down in any manner . " This is just the beginning . We plan to include more information that students would find useful . " <p> Till now the team has shied away from earning revenues from the site . But offers are coming knocking at their doors . " Various colleges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " reveals Adhun " But we are planning on having a different sort of advertising in our site ; we are trying to do it region-centric . " <p> The response to www.enguide.in has been overwhelming . With the kind of vision that these young minds have , in all probability , this website could be the most uttered name on the lips of every aspiring B.Tech student in the state soon .
