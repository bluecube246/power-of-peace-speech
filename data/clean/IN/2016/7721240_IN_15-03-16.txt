Mar 16 , 2016 , 05.24 AM IST  NEW DELHI : The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it could not judicially examine the Air Service Agreement ( ASA ) between India and the UAE , an agreement which BJP member Subramnian Swamy has claimed conferred undue and unfair concessions to Jet-Etihad at the cost of national carrier Air India .  Appearing for the Centre , additional solicitor general P S Narasimha told a bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justice U U Lalit that the ASA was akin to a bilateral treaty and hence beyond the ambit of judicial scrutiny . However , the bench found during the hearing that Swamy had challenged the April 24 , the ASA on September 3 , 2013 .  Appearing for Jet Airways , senior advocate A M Singhvi said the pact had helped AI , Jet and Indigo increase their passenger capacity but Swamy had not made any other airline a party except Jet . The bench asked Swamy to amend his petition in three weeks to challenge the September 3 pact and include other airlines which would be affected by the outcome of the plea . It also asked the Centre to respond to the amended plea in four weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on July 19 .  Swamy had sought quashing of the April 24 pact claiming that it gave unfair concessions to Etihad Airways and Jet Airways .
