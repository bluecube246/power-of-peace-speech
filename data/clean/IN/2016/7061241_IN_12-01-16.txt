Then one day we had their unapproachable majesty tested and even occasionally trammelled by the politics of aluminium smelters that came with hydrocarbon flares . <p> A by-product was desalinated water and a regressive religious cult whose practitioners could wilfully endorse the slitting of throats of innocents and accept mass rape as divine retribution . The tallest of skyscrapers that petrodollars could conjure up in these stricken parts must continue to make seawater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need dire . <p> The inescapable absurdity of Ashraf 's exiled life in Dubai , where the twin sister of the Shah died at 96 on Thursday , ought to have come early . I was visiting Iran for my Dubai newspaper in September 1980 to cover the turn of events in her country . The immigration officer at Tehran 's Mehrabad airport scratched his head to figure out where Dubai might be before he could also accept that it had a robust English newspaper where Indian , Pakistani and British expatriates published news stories of quality . It is a hamlet south of Bandar Abbas , perhaps , across the Khaleej Fars , a junior custom officer had concluded . Lord Curzon had referred to the Gulf as a British lake . <p> Before Iran 's 1979 turbulence , it was safe to believe that Ashraf served as the true power behind her brother , the Shah . It was she who pushed him into taking power in a 1953 coup engineered by the CIA . <p> Ashraf 's past had an organic link with high society in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia 's cultural alcoves . <p> She had her share of tragedy too . Assassins killed her son on a Paris street just after the Islamic Revolution , her twin brother died of cancer shortly after , while a niece died of a 2001 drug overdose in London and a nephew killed himself in Boston 10 years later . <p> Yet , she always defended her brother 's rule and held on to her royal past . <p> Ashraf 's past had an organic link with high society in Europe but her presence was just as socially pervasive in South Asia 's cultural alcoves . For the ' cultured ' men , to have a Persian wife was a status to aspire to -- one that could only be challenged with a deeper knowledge of Persian literature . Everyone said ' Khudahafiz ' for goodbye , and reference to Allah was administered in its proper Arabic context -- Fi amaan Allah . The Shia-Sunni identity existed but without today 's toxic subtext . Persian was as much a Sunni language as it was flaunted for its Shia mystical lineage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorces , and her penchant for gambling was toasted even among the orthodox milieu of old Lucknow . Her legend intertwined with the flavour of the kings and queens of the era -- the Wallis Simpson affair , King Hussein 's love for Queen Alia and her tragic death in a helicopter crash , and , of course , the grand arrival of Farah Diba as the empress of Iran . These were all part of a tradition in which Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten too found a bit role . <p> There was no context better or more enticing than the fact that these giant , larger-than-life figures strode the planet in our vicinity . It was n't entirely in the realm of exaggeration that sometimes these apparitions mingled with ordinary mortals . Princess Ashraf is credited with helping Indian movie mogul Raj Kapoor get his 1960s magnum opus Sangam run in Iran for close to two years . Indian distributors who won the contract through the princess call their London headquarters ' Sangam ' . <p> Born in October 1919 , Princess Ashraf was the daughter of the monarch Reza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered by Britain and later was forced to abdicate the throne after a 1941 invasion by Britain and Russia . By 1953 , the CIA and British intelligence helped orchestrate the coup that overthrew Iran 's popularly elected prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh over fears he was tilting towards the Soviet Union . <p> But the Shah was " a man of indecision " , says a CIA account of the coup first published by The New York Times in 2000 . To push the coup along , the plotters reached out to " the Shah 's dynamic and forceful twin sister " who had reportedly already been in touch with US and British agents . After " considerable pressure " by her , the Shah reportedly agreed . <p> While her brother 's government ruled in opulence and its secret police tortured political activists , the question that comes to mind is this : how have we fared with the clerical regime that followed the fall of the Pahlavis ? <p> Think of Ayatollah Khalkhali , " the laughing executioner " of Tehran , who self-confessedly relished his daily turnover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he not fill in with aplomb for the Shah 's Savak secret police ? There must have been more to Iran than the repression of the Shia clergy . There is evidence that the two future rivals often colluded to target Tudeh communists and the Bahai minority . <p> The Shah 's liberal veneer drew even his critics to his charmed circle , of which Princess Ashraf was the presiding deity . On one occasion , ignoring the orders of his own Communist Party of India , renowned Urdu scholar and poet Ali Sardar Jafri accepted a significant award from the Shah of Iran . And though in the tradition of communist parties Jafri was forced return the prize , Iran 's civilisational links continued to explore ideals that enticed him . That could not be said of a worldview nourished by desalinated water .
