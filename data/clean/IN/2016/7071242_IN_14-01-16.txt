indian jews are genetically more subcontinental than west asian  1923-2016 lieutenant general ( retd ) jfr jacob , a decorated military man and jew who was the indian army 's eastern commander during the 1971 bangladesh liberation war , passed away in new delhi on wednesday pti  hyderabad , january 14 :  did you know that the first migrant jew arrived in the indian sub-continent about 1,500 years ago in cochin ( now kochi ) ?  further , the indian jewish population is a unique blend of indian and west asian genetic ancestry , with a majority of its genes coming from south asian ancestors . these findings have been published by an international scientific group led by indians in nature 's online journal scientific reports .  there are three main distinct jewish groups living in india -- the jews of cochin in kerala , the bene israel in mumbai and the baghdadi jews in kolkata . each of these communities is socially linked more to their neighbours than one another .  there are several stories about their migration to india records and inscriptions have ensured their origin remains shrouded in legends .  using genetic data , an international team of scientists led by kumarasamy thangaraj from the centre for cellular and molecular biology hyderabad ; and scientists from estonian biocentre , tratu , estonia ; amala institute of medical sciences , thrissur , university of kolkata , india and genome foundation , hyderabad have now traced the founder of the indian jewish populations .  the analysis suggests that the indian jew possesses traces of west asian ancestry , together with a more likely unidirectional gene-flow from their contemporary indian populations . " to trace the origin and mixture of indian jewish populations , extensive dna analysis of indian jewish was conducted using high-resolution genetic markers and compared them with native indian populations and people from rest of the world , " said ccmb 's director ch mohan rao .  " the expansion of the indian jews from west asia was followed by extensive admixture and assimilation with local populations ; nevertheless the rooted ancestry to their ancestral place can be testified because of a higher proportion of genetic .  global scenario  jewish communities are distributed throughout the world . however , of all the jewish diaspora , indian jews are the least studied . although genetic studies on european jews have traced their links to west asia , the exact parental population group and time of dispersal of indian jewish has remained disputed .  " the initial admixture with local indian populations followed by strict endogamy has made the indian jewish a unique populations and studying their genomes will be useful in disease mapping , " said gyaneshwer chaubey , a member of the research team .  the ccmb has been conducting path-breaking research in unearthing genetic links of several populations under its population genetics research programme .  get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox  1 . comments will be moderated by the hindu business line editorial team . 2 . comments that are abusive , personal , incendiary or irrelevant can not be published . 3 . please write complete sentences . do not type comments in all capital letters , or in all lower case letters , or substitute for you , d is not ' the ' , n is not ' and ' ) . 4 . we may remove hyperlinks within comments . 5 . please use a genuine email id and provide your name , to avoid rejection .
