spl cell arrests gunrunner , seizes .32 bore pistols  new delhi : the .32 bore gun seems to have become the weapon of choice for delhi 's gangsters these days .  the special cell of delhi police busted a consignment of 20 such semi-automatic pistols and arrested a firozabad-based gunrunner a week after a policeman was brutally beaten and gunned down by criminals armed with .32 bore pistols .  sources said that targets have a higher chance of surviving when shot with a weapon of this calibre than 9mm and others like .22 bore .  this gives the criminals a lesser chance of being booked in a case of murder . cops said that this calibre is preferred by robbers and street criminals who do n't intend to kill .  the gunrunner , ajay bhardwaj , got a licence to run a liquor shop at the age of 26 in firozabad , but he took to his " family business " of supplying arms after getting shot at six times by his rivals , said dcp ( special cell ) pramod kushwaha . he is married with two children .  " ajay 's brother , prashant , runs an arms syndicate in up and procures weapons from madhya pradesh-based modules . the suspect delivered 5-6 consignments in the last few months to delhi 's gangsters . ajay got rs 1,000 for each weapon delivered , " kushwaha added .  on august 26 , inspectors manoj dixit and shiv kumar got a tip-off that ajay bhardwaj would be coming to a gurdwara in vinod nagar of east delhi to deliver a huge cache of weapons to his contact .
