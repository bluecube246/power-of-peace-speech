India wastes 15-20% of its renewable energy due to lack of storage : Panasonic Energy head  The variations in wind and solar energy , and the lack of adequate electricity storage facilities , result in about 15-20 per cent of all renewable energy generated in India going to waste , according to a top official in Panasonic India 's energy division .  Grid management  " On average , if 24 hours is the potential of electricity generation , then you can easily say that 15-20 per cent is wasted because the grid ca n't manage the kind of variation in the electricity sourced from wind and solar generation , " Atul Arya , Head , Energy Systems , Panasonic India told The Hindu in an interview .  The variability of generation from renewable sources -- where wind changes direction and speed on an hourly basis and solar intensity can vary by the minute -- is not that big a problem if renewable energy forms a small proportion of the overall grid , as it does currently in the national grid , Mr Arya India at the moment , Mr Arya said , is to simply discard the unstable power without it ever entering the grid .  That 's where storage technology comes in . Storage technology can ensure that no matter the wind or solar generation , what you get out of the generation-cum-storage unit is a uniform output , " which is great for the grid " , according to Mr Arya .  As far as battery technology goes , lithium-ion batteries -- the kind used in cellphones -- have emerged as the technology of choice since they outperform all the other competing technologies in terms of size , capacity , efficiency , and environmental impact .  Sector Incentives  The Central government has been pushing renewable energy hard since it came to power , but there it is still moving relatively slowly on storage technologies , something that a few policy decisions could rectify , according to Mr Arya .  Viability-gap funding  Apart from announcing tax incentives for storage technology manufacturing , such as is being done for the IT sector , other steps like viability-gap funding @ @ @ @ @ @
