<h> All you need is one <p> Admit it ! Life 's no cakewalk and running around or getting about while getting things done on the fly is a huge part of modern-day lifestyle . <p> If you feel that this , is in fact , one of the main features , you would n't be mistaken . Makes sense , then , to have gadgets that are excellent at multi-tasking . And hence the barrage of smartwatches , tablets and a host of other paraphernalia which defines and enhances your own little ecosystem of gadgetry . More often than not , things do n't live up to their tag of being a swiss army knife of functionality . For starters , you 've got to have a good pair of headphones , because enveloping oneself in a sonic cocoon of one 's choice is a lot better than listening to the symphony of cacophony , also know as , ' the daily commute ' . And amidst this beautiful experience , the joys of handling calls , should you need to , are just indescribable . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jabra claims to be thy saviour , at least for the scenario mentioned above .

From handling calls to controlling your playlist , you can get it all done via the one-touch control buttons found on the neckband .
