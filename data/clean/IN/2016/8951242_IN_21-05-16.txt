india sent its first hockey contingent to the olympics in 1928 , but that was only the final step of a historic journey .  when the topic of indian hockey comes up , talk veers inevitably towards the golden age . the period between 1928 and 1956 , when indian hockey conquered all that came in front of it , when it won six consecutive gold medals in the olympics and basked in the adulation of the world . but the story behind how indian hockey as an entity first came into existence is no less fascinating and not without its share of red herrings .  it is widely believed that india 's journey in hockey can be traced back to 1885 when the calcutta hockey club came into existence . but nikhilesh bhattacharya , a phd fellow who has researched the origins of indian hockey at the olympic studies centre in switzerland and the hockey museum in the united kingdom , is not so sure . according to him , there is no conclusive evidence to establish the year .  polo as hockey silver tankard that was presented to captain joseph ford sherer of the 49th bengal native infantry by the calcutta hockey club in february 1864 . the date is significant , because that would mean the existence of the sport in india before the foundation of the teddington hockey club in england in 1871 , which formulated the rules of modern field hockey .  but before one gets too excited , it is important to hear bhattacharya 's clarification : what was mentioned as hockey at that time was not field hockey as we know it , but polo .  " it is important to remember that in india in the 19th century , hockey often referred to a game played on horseback . hence , it would be naive to assume that all the so-called ' hockey ' clubs at that time played the game as we know it now . we do have proof of a field hockey tournament called the beighton cup coming into existence in calcutta in 1895 , followed by the aga khan cup in bombay in 1896 . the launch of tournaments would suggest , at least , but for how many years , it is difficult to say . "  an archival photo of polo being played in manipur . image credit : wikimedia commons  the beighton cup is the oldest running hockey tournament in the world . organised each year faithfully even now by the bengal hockey association , it is a tournament which shaped the growth of hockey in the country , giving it context and adding to the popularity of it . hockey legend dhyan chand said it was his life 's ambition to win the beighton cup , which he did with his team , the jhansi heroes , in 1933 .  the jhansi heroes , with dhyan chand front row , third from right . taken from dhyan chand 's autobiography , ' goal ! ' published by sport and pastime from madras in 1952 .  humble beginnings  the year 1908 saw the foundation of the bengal hockey association , an indicator that hockey was spreading widely in the province , with enough clubs to warrant the formation of a governing body . but was the publication of a book titled hockey in india and how to play it with rules of the game and explanatory notes , written by an englishman named walter troup . in the book , troup mentions the names of various clubs playing hockey around northern and western india , including the bombay gymkhana club , united provinces police team , the naini tal volunteers and the jhansi railway institute hockey team . in fact , a look at the winners of the first few beighton cups also disproves the predominant notion that hockey was strictly a sport restricted to the army -- teams from civilian clubs , educational institutions , the police , railways and other departments were also actively involved .  the other interesting fact about troup 's book is that there is a small footnote on the title page which says it is also available in hindi and urdu . that is quite significant , according to bhattacharya . " i have not seen extant copies of the book in those languages , but the very fact that troup was looking at readership in the regional people beyond the english-speaking classes . "  the title page of walter troup 's book .  there was also a typically english rant about the quality of refereeing in india , which in troup 's view was abysmal .  before entering into details of the game of hockey , i should like to touch on one regrettable feature of the game as played in india . i refer to those reprehensible methods of play , against which umpires as a body do not set their faces as they should . as a result of foul play and incompetent umpiring i have myself been on the injured list for months at a time . to give an instance . i was playing for the bombay gymkhana in 1909 in the aga khan hockey tournament , when on no less than four occasions i was badly fouled by the same player . it is true that he was warned and finally turned off the ground , but that was poor compensation for me , or to my side . i fell on the wrong side of my wrist , and . i was unable to play for 8 months . i would add that the offender , though known as the foulest of foul players , is still allowed on the ground . no improvement can be hoped for , till a recognised " indian hockey association " is formed , and definite rules are framed dealing with such offenders who disgrace the game .  ( hockey in india , ii )  the story then moves to 1919 when the indian olympic association was founded and , with the help of the philanthropic dorabji tata , the first indian contingent was sent to the 1920 in antwerp . since then , india 's first foray into the olympics has been seen as a nationalistic endeavour but bhattacharya begs to disagree .  the six indians selected to represent india at the 1920 antwerp games by the indian olympic association , a precursor to the organisation with the same name that still runs olympic sport in india . it seems hd kaikadi did not appear in any event .  " there were various people involved in sending an indian the governor of bombay george lloyd , the secretary of state for india , edwin montagu , and even the secretary of the british olympic association , the reverend robert stuart de courcy laffan , " noted bhattacharya . " in fact , the british government provided full support to the endeavour as they looked at it as way to channelise nationalistic sentiments . "  glory on the world stage  it was in 1928 that an indian hockey team first entered the olympics , but india had conquered the world even before that . in 1926 , an indian army team , containing dhyan chand , toured new zealand and won almost every game they played on that tour . the eyes of the hockey world were fixed on them -- for all talk and purpose , india had left its imprint on the hockey world .  coverage of the indian army hockey team 's 1926 tour from hockey world .  there is one last interesting footnote to this story . india were the undisputed champions of men 's hockey , conquering all that came before them 1928 , 1932 and 1936 . the 1936 triumph has gone down in folkore where one of the finest indian teams , led by dhyan chand in his prime , humbled mighty germany 8-1 in the final .  play  no team from great britain or its constituent parts ( i.e. england , scotland , ireland and wales ) took part in the olympics between 1928 and 1936 . it remained one of chand 's biggest regrets in life that he did not get the opportunity to beat the rulers at their own game .  but there was a sense of poetic justice to it as well . when india reached the final of the 1948 olympics hockey tournament , their opponents were great britain , making a comeback to the world event . and revenge was sweet , one year after they achieved independence from their former colonial rulers , india thrashed britain 4-0.
