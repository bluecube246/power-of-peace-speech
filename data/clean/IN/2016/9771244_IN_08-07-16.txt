the nostalgic coming-of-age story of india post  we all are tuned to cope up with the delays and defaults of government services . yes , in india , approaching a government office is generally perceived as " the job of the jobless ; " and if anyone dares to do that , he/she should be prepared to buy " thousand pairs of sandals " before getting the task done ( courtesy : a commercial from a footwear company ) . for the same reason i had developed an aversion towards india post services when i was living in metros , far away from my family in kerala . the indefinite wait for receiving a registered post or a letter from my family had often made me vent my anger on the lifeless bricks of my house . it was when i fell prey to the ' lightning speed ' promises of the private courier companies . .  surprisingly , the story has a different twist now . india post has evolved to a tech-savvy , people friendly service ; on the other side , the totally unhappy with the way private courier companies are handling the service ; and trust me , now i am in deep love with india post speed post service ! yes , india post has transformed a lot ; they are no more the slowpoke , but are the people-friendly mail delivery service of the new-age indian .  the process is simple , but highly professional . i book the post at a post office at a minimum price ; it costs less than half of private courier service . my mobile number is attached to the packet . the moment the party receives the packet , i get an sms . in case someone sends me a packet where my number is mentioned i get the message as soon as it reaches my post office . what 's more impressive is that you can track the packet , bit by bit -- done in a superb way -- much more professional than the so-called professional couriers ! ( see the image below ) .  have you ever approached a private courier helpline and have you ever succeeded in you are lucky ! i have had enough bad experience from them . the numbers given in the website never get on their way . in case i succeed in connecting one of them , the executives play smarter by re-directing our calls to the next agent or asking us to contact the next branch office , and so on . frustrated , i have also filed a legal case against a courier firm that failed to deliver a cheque to my old mother . they asked her to travel a long 25 km to collect the packet . the reason : they do n't have the service in that remote village .  yes , here 's the success of our own india post that has 154,866 post offices , ( 89.8% of which belong to rural india ) . hats off to the visionaries of this postal system ; now we are able to connect anyone in any corner of india- even in places where telephone , cable tv and electricity are distant dreams . i was sad when the department of posts announced the " demise " of same will happen to the inland letter , post card , post cover and those sticky stamps , all of which still sleep in the treasure box of my romantic days ! indeed , they arouse the nostalgic at the same time exciting memories of those days when i eagerly waited for the postman carrying the letter/ greetings from my boyfriend !  memories will fade away , so are the materials on earth that build those memories . in this age of e-mail , whatsapp and 123greetings.com , there is no point in worrying about the fate of inland , post cards , and the like ; but i still feel we should preserve our postal network without any damage to it , and uphold its integrity of serving the people in a democratic way . i am optimistic seeing the evolution of our age-old post-office to a banking center , a pension/pf shelter for elderly , an e-commerce collection center , and much more in offing .  yes , there is no substitute for india post . it 's the heart of the country , circulating its pulses it die .
