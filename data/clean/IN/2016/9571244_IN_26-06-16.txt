<h> ? Today 's Paper ? KARNATAKA <h> Fishing harbour stage III likely to be completed by next monsoon <p> New facility:Stage III was conceived after finding that the existing facilities at Stage I and Stage II were inadequate to the growing number of fishing vessels even as they lacked basic infrastructure . -- File photo : H.S. Manjunath <h> National Green Tribunal disposes of petitions challenging the project <p> With the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) disposing of applications challenging the environment clearance accorded to Mangaluru Fishing Harbour Stage III , the department of fisheries is hopeful of completing the project before the onset of next monsoon . It should have been completed by 2015 . <p> The Rs. 57.6-crore project ( initial estimation in 2010 ) ran into rough weather after Hoige Bazar residents Octavia Albuquerque and six others approached the Karnataka High Court in 2012 challenging the environment clearance given to the project , particularly for the improvement of the Felix Creek closer to the Albuquerque Tile Factory . The matter was transferred to NGT in 2013 . <p> Inadequate facilities <p> Stage III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ( 1984 ) and Stage II ( 2003 ) were inadequate to the growing number of fishing vessels even as they lacked basic infrastructure like toilets , rest rooms , canteens etc . <p> Stage III was planned on about 1.3 lakh sq mts of land to the South of existing harbour ( towards Hoige Bazar ) as well as in Bengre ( for idle berthing and repair of vessels ) . It involved dredging , levelling of land , repairs to existing wharf , developing traffic area , setting up of fish auction centre , gear shed for fishermen , net mending shed , rest house , boat repair shop , restaurant , installation of radio communication tower , shelters for the security personnel , electricity and water supply system , RCC box bridges , and rainwater harvesting system . <p> Funding constraint <p> Director of Fisheries Veerappa Gowda said that the project was undertaken on 75:25 funding by Central and State governments and so far Rs. 42 crore have been spent . <p> Though the Central government has released about Rs. 11 crore so far , the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly , he told The Hindu . The government would also persuade the Centre to share 75 per cent of the revised estimated cost ( Rs. 82.5 crore ) as against the original estimated cost . <p> Executive Engineer of Public Works Department ( Ports and Fisheries Division ) , Udupi , T.S . Rathod said about 70 per cent of the work on Stage III is already complete . <p> Except for portions of work involving construction of RCC slab for the bridge connecting Stage II and III , widening and deepening of the Felix Creek , construction of three RCC sloping and a giving finishing touch to a few buildings on Bengre-side , the work is almost complete , he said . If the funds are released on time , the project should be in place by May next , Mr. Rathod hoped .
