gandhiji 's request to my grandmother , ms subbulakshmi  email  print  comments  that voice .  my best memory of her is of her practicing her singing during long summer afternoons at home . not a day went by when she did not practice . she would gently tune the tanpura , her graceful fingers running over the strings . she had the most beautiful hands , and the way she would move them or bring them together while singing was a wonderful sight in itself . she would close her eyes and almost seem to resonate with the vibrating strings of the tanpura . only after that would she hand it over to the person behind her , and begin .  that voice .  it would fill the heavy afternoon air and wrap itself around you and in you . in that moment , she was ms subbulakshmi , a legend , an icon . when she would finish , it would be like she had woken up from another plane of existence and returned to the reality that included she would be my grandmother once again .  my father was by blood the grand-nephew of sadashivam , my thatha or grandfather and subbulakshmi or patti . while he moved into their household when he was a baby , he was formally adopted when he turned 13 . there was a huge-inter generational gap between her and me , which forbade a more informal relationship . but she was very affectionate and always a wonderful presence to be around . there was something about her that seemed so pure and so childlike that i always enjoyed meeting her . we would go over for either lunch or tiffin , and on entering , i would greet her with a hug ; just before leaving , i would have to go to the puja room with her and my grandfather , offer a prayer and a formal namaskar by touching their feet for their blessings ; then i would leave with the prasadam .  on getting older , i witnessed much discourse among adults of the family and outside that was about deconstructing her mystique . she was a young voice . born to the devadasi tradition , she was determined to not live as one with her patronage dependent on the whims of a man . on coming to madras as a teenager , she performed and acted in movies , had a full life and was establishing herself as a woman of great talent . when she met and married my grandfather , she took on a mantle of brahminrespectability that she had perhaps craved all her life . india , while in the throes of flux with the independence movement , was still entrenched in a certain patriarchy of gender and caste that restricted agency to women . this was really strong in the field of the arts . carnatic music at the time was the domain ofbrahminmen , and her sheer talent and presence transcended that in a way never seen before .  kishori amonkar called her the " aathvaan sur " , lata mangeshkar called her " tapaswini " , bade ghulam ali khan called her " surswaralakshmi subbulakshmi " and sarojini naidu conferred upon her the title of " the nightingale of india . to national fame in 1947 . the hindi version was released in delhi by sarojini naidu and it moved nehru to say , " who am i , a mere prime minister , before the queen of song ? " both my grandparents were active in the freedom movement . my grandfather more so than my grandmother , even having been arrested and thrown in jail by the british for a while . my grandmother 's performances would generate money that would go towards the freedom movement and the kasturba foundation . in 1947 , just a few months post-independence , my grandfather received a call asking for my grandmother to sing one of gandhiji 's favourite bhajans and send it to delhi . my grandfather said that they were unfamiliar with the bhajan and would not be able to do it justice , and could perhaps another singer sing it . they promptly got a call back from gandhiji , who said he would rather have subbulakshmi speak the bhajan than have anyone else sing it . so overnight they recorded " hari tum haro " and sent it to new year , while listening to all india radio for the news , as she did all her life , she heard the announcement of gandhiji 's assassination , after which she heard her own voice singing hari tum haro - distraught , she fainted . even years later , she would always choke up and cry when narrating the story . in her lifetime , she would hear that bhajan played twice more after assassinations - after indira gandhi 's and rajiv gandhi 's deaths , right after the announcements on all india radio .  she was the first asian musician to receive the ramon magsaysay award for charity work . all her life , she and my grandfather gave away all their money earned from concerts to various charitable organisations . both of them believed that her musical ability was divine and could not be monetised . she believed herself to be just a tool of god channeling blessings through her songs . the wonder of it was when she sang , she could take us , her listeners , into a plane so divine it made us , her picture hangs with pictures of various gods and goddesses in puja rooms .  she was also the first indian musician to perform at the un general assembly and one of the first to take carnatic music abroad .  but through all of that , she remained a shy simple person , still excited when anyone went up to her and told her how much they loved her music . i remember her as someone who disliked any kind of rude behavior . injustice and violence hurt her personally , and she hated anger and confrontations .  in the years that i was a dancer , she came for every single one of my performances and would sit in the front row and keep rhythm . i would try and block out the fact that she was there because my nerves would be shot . i had the honour of escorting her to rashtrapati bhavan when she was awarded the bharat ratna , and i remember her as both happy and sad as by then my grandfather had passed away .  my last picture of her a hospital bed giving my hand a slight squeeze the day before she died . the picture i prefer is the one with of her with her great smile and the flashing diamond nose rings , one of which i received after she died . with her music that i still listen to almost on a daily basis , i feel her presence strongly .  in every generation , they say , comes a person who shakes everything that was held true up until then and fills imaginations in a way they have never been inspired before . my grandmother subbulakshmi was one such person .  my first birthday blessings ceremony  my mom , brother and me with my gran  me ( on left ) with my grandparents and cousins  ( swati thiyagarajan is an environment editor with ndtv )  disclaimer : the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author . the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same .
