<p> There is sheer lack of awareness of a simple diatom test that can be of great help in forensic investigations , especially in cases of death due to drowning , said forensic pathologist Dr TD Dogra , while inaugurating a national workshop on the role of diatoms in forensics at MACS Agharkar Research Institute on Monday . <p> Diatoms are aquatic plants which play an important role in investigations , especially in cases of drowning . They help in locating the place of drowning , said Dogra , former director of AIIMS , New Delhi , citing instances where a simple diatom test had proved effective and the forensic team could establish in court that certain murder cases were actually deaths due to drowning . <p> Dogra gave the instance of the ' rape and murder ' case of Neelofar Jan and her 17-year-old sister-in-law in Shopian . " We used the diatom test that attributed the death to accidental drowning , " he said . <p> Diatoms found inside the body of a drowned victim may serve as corroborative evidence in diagnosing the cause of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on diatoms at ARI , said . Diatoms are diverse microscopic algae with silica cell walls that are found in almost every aquatic environment including fresh and marine waters . <p> If the person is still alive when entering the water , diatoms will enter the lungs if the person inhales water and drowns . The diatoms are then carried to distant parts of the body such as brain , kidneys and bone marrow by circulation . If the person is dead when entering the water , then there is no circulation and the diatoms can not enter the body . <p> Diatoms do not occur naturally in the body . If laboratory tests show diatoms in the corpse that are of the same species found in the water where the body was recovered , then it may be good evidence of drowning as the cause of death , the scientist explained . <p> Earlier Dr K M Paknikar , Director of ARI , said the institute is creating a database of diatoms in Maharashtra for preserving biodiversity . <p> While Dogra urged more awareness about the role of diatoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars and students in the field of forensic science on their role in crime investigations and overcoming shortcomings associated with diatom analysis .
