<h> Tribal remnants in Meiteis/Meeteis <p> I am neither an ethnographer nor a sociologist but certainly a student of history specialized in ancient history . We have studied the tribal ways of life in ancient period particularly of this sub-continent . Some of the prominent features of tribal ways of living are -- nature-worship , ancestor-worship , dead burial , hunting-gathering , fishing , group dinning and wine(ing) , **26;352;TOOLONG , egalitaria- nism , ethnic drinks , peculiar diets , dances and attires etc . After a certain stage of development and advancement the tribal features do disappear slowly and steadily in almost all the societies . In some places the pace of development is so rapid and so massive that the old traditional ways of living completely wither away . It will be extremely difficult to trace the ancient tribal tradition and practices in the cosmopolitan and metropolitan cities . However in the villages and under-developed areas we can still find ancient traditions and practices even today . In remote places or in the hills where the light and sound or the meal and material of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in vogue . For instance , some of the ethnic people of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are still continuing with their traditional style of living . Likewise in far flung areas in Chhotanagpur or Arunachal Pradesh many ethnic groups are still living with their tribal traits and culture . The Meiteis/ Meeteis are the largest ethnic group in Manipur . Their way of living is very similar if not identical with other ethnic groups in the State . If we segregate the Hindu way of life from the Meiteis , their culture is as good as other ethnic tribal groups ; the way they dine , drink and dance are not different from other indigenous groups in the State . Before the arrival of Hinduism in the State there was hardly any distinction between the hill people and valley people or in other words amongst the indigenous people . They mixed up without any hindrances and hesitation . There were innumerable matrimonial alliances amongst all the ethnic groups and communities in the State . It is not my imagination ; these are part of our recorded history . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meiteis and other ethnic communities . The implantation of the practice of holy and unholiness , concept of pure and polluted and the idea of Verna system made our world up-side-down . Gradually the other ethnic groups started distancing themselves from the Meiteis . The gap between the Meiteis and other ethnic groups was further widened when they started accepting Christianity in the 19th and 20th century . Sometimes I feel that religions have destroyed our brotherhood/sisterhood and fraternity . Otherwise we could have continued to gather as an egalitarian society like the Shinto society in Japan and Tao society in China . DISTINCTIVE CULTURE : Meiteis have continued with some of their old tradition and practices despite Hinduisation and Sanskritization . They continue with Lai Haraoba ( invoking and worshipping of local gods and goddesses ) in almost all the localities . It is also a fact that during Lai Haraoba all forms of ethnic dances ( wearing traditional costumes ) are performed before the deity . Even today Meiteis are also worshipping their forefathers and ancestors in the form of Chaklon Katpa and Apokpa Khoirumba . In every Meitei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progenitor god ) . A strong tradition of ancestral worship is present in every tribal society . In addition our Sagolkangjei ( polo ) , Mukna ( wrestling ) , Jagoi ( dances ) , Huyen-lalong ( martial- arts ) etc. are part of our inherent distinctive culture . PRIMITIVE WAY OF LIFE : Some of the primitive habits still linger on among the Meiteis . For instance the habit of eating snails , eels , insects ( nousek , koujeng , watin etc ) are still continuing with many of them . Again ' Yu ' ( local rice brew ) which is as old as their culture , is still a popular drink among the Meiteis . As other tribal groups do , Meiteis are very fond of fermented bamboo- soot , beans , fry ( fish ) etc . In terms of attire , Meitei women have been wearing phanek since time immemorial and at the same time Meitei men are wearing Khudei and Ningri ( without underwear ) . These traditional attires are more or less the same for all the ethnic groups of Manipur ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and texture ; otherwise the traditional dresses of all the ethnic people of Manipur are similar . SHYNESS OF CONTACT : Another significant tribal feature of the Meiteis is their shyness to interact and mixing-up with the outsiders . The present ILPS movement is perhaps an apt example of their shyness and xenophobia . GENERAL BACKWARDNESS : Meiteis are lagging far behind in education , employment , health-care , **26;380;TOOLONG , science and technology , trade and commerce , industrial development etc. as compared to other advanced communities of the developed areas . GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION : Meiteis are living in geographical isolation ; they are the inhabitants of the valley of Manipur , which is surrounded by ranges of hills and mountains and it is completely land locked . The means of transport and communication with the outside world is through the erratic and unsafe National highways and airlines . Quite often they are cut off from the outside world as a result of frequent blockades and bandhs affecting the National highways and even the Airport . Instead of futile squabbles and arguments among ourselves to decide whether we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and for all . I believe our legislators are listening. -
