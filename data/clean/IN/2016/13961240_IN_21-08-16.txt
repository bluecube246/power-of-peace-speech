Sedition rumours had plagued ' Saraswatichandra '  AHMEDABAD : It proved to be one of the most agonizing moments in the life of Govardhanram Tripathi , when the third part of his magnum opus ' Saraswatichandra ' was being published in Bombay in 1898 .  Rumours of his arrest for writing seditious material in this part of the novel spread like wildfire . The third part of the original 2,200 page and four-part novel dealt with statecraft in which Tripathi displays tremendous courage deliberating on the impact of British rule on native states in the light of the 1857 revolution .  This fact was brought to light for the first time from Tripathi 's personal ' scrap book ' , which was researched by Sabarmati Ashram director Tridip Suhrud . He has already translated three of the four parts of Tripathi 's novel into English , 128 years after the publication of the original . The fourth part of the novel will be out shortly .  Soon after rumours of his arrest began , Tripathi 's wife , mother and sister spent two him . In his scrap book Tripathi asked , " Was it a mistake to have written a book which has so disturbed the peace and happiness of my family ? What is my duty ? To boldly write such a book for my people , or secure the peace of my family against such contingency . "  " A large section of this part of the novel described British policy and questioned whether to support such a rule , said Suhrud . " The British through their ' petty ' officials especially in Saurashtra were arbitrating disputes between various princely states and practically governing the ruling class . "  " Tripathi had critically analysed the treatise that the British signed with different states and also projected its possible fallout - that of depreciation of native states , " said Suhrud . " There was a public perception that the novel exposed the ulterior design behind British policies . "  Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App .
