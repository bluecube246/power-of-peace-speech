"  devotees need to place an order seven months in advance to get an alum ganpati idol . speaking about the size and weight of the idol , kamble , said , " the size of the idol depends upon the size of the alum stone . maximum size is approximately 1 to 1.5 kg depending upon the carving done on the alum . food colour is used for decoration and beautification of idols . since alum does not come in a particular design , it is one of the uniqueness of alum idols . "  kamble takes about eight days to carve a single idol . talking about difficulties , kamble said , " alum has different layers , so if i carve one wrong step and since i am the only one sculpting the idols , i have to start all over again with on another alum.
