Concerned about environment , many people have been doing their bit for its conservation . As the trend of eco-friendly ganpati is catching up in various cities , few years ago , Pune-based friends Ramesh Kher and Vivek Kamble came up with an idea to sculpt an idol out of alum .  Alum is majorly used for the purification of water . According to the duo , their aim is to help with the water pollution during immersions . Vivek Kamble , Pune-based sculptor who carves alum to transform it into an idol , said , " It is a brainchild of my friend . As a trail , he asked for my help in carving a few idols . As alum easily dissolves in water , this initiative will reduce the pollution level . "  Devotees need to place an order seven months in advance to get an alum ganpati idol . Speaking about the size and weight of the idol , Kamble , said , " The size of the idol depends upon the size of the alum stone . Maximum size is approximately 1 to 1.5 kg depending upon the carving done on the alum . Food colour is used for decoration and beautification of idols . Since alum does not come in a particular design , it is one of the uniqueness of alum idols . "  Kamble takes about eight days to carve a single idol . Talking about difficulties , Kamble said , " Alum has different layers , so if I carve one wrong step and since I am the only one sculpting the idols , I have to start all over again with on another alum.
