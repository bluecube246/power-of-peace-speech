<h> Jakarta bombings : here 's what we know about ISIS in Indonesia <p> A series of bombings hit a shopping area in Jakarta , Indonesia 's capital , late on Wednesday night . At least two civilians and five of the attackers were killed , according to the BBC . <p> An ISIS-affiliated news outlet claims the group was responsible for the attacks ; Indonesian police have n't fully confirmed it but suspect it to be true . Jakarta Police Chief Tito Karnavian told the BBC that Bahrun Naim , an Indonesian militant who is believed to be in Syria , had been " planning this for a while . " <p> The attack raises a very serious question : How much of a presence does ISIS have in the world 's largest Muslim-majority country ? What follows is brief guide to what we know about ISIS radicalism in Indonesia -- and what 's concerning about it . <h> ISIS 's role in Indonesia <p> Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority country -- about 210 million of its 250 million people are Muslim . Estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion , but a concerning number on its own -- have left Indonesia to go fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq . <p> " There are at least 600 Southeast Asians fighting in Syria , " the Soufan Group , a private firm focusing on terrorism analysis , wrote in a December 2015 report . " The vast majority are from Indonesia . " <p> This is n't for lack of trying on ISIS 's part : According to the Soufan Group , ISIS has been posting propaganda videos aimed at recruiting Indonesians since July 2014 . Yet , perhaps owing to Indonesia 's historically moderate brand of Islam , they have n't succeeded . Sidney Jones , the director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict , told the Nikkei Asian Review that as a percentage of total population , Belgians have been 20 times as likely as Indonesians to join ISIS . <p> Still , even the small number of Indonesian recruits pose a threat if some of them were to come home from Syria or Iraq to plan attacks . It 's possible that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . <p> Another possibility , perhaps more concerning , is that ISIS has linked up with a homegrown Indonesian militant group . Indonesia is home to a number of Islamist extremist groups , most notably Jemaah Islamiyah , which has links to al-Qaeda . JI has pulled off far more devastating attacks than Wednesday 's : A 2002 JI attack in Bali killed 202 people , and a 2009 attack in Jakarta killed nine . <p> JI has condemned ISIS as apostates , but it 's not obvious that all Indonesian militant groups feel the same way . Luke Hunt lists off a few that are thought to be friendly to ISIS in the Diplomat : <p> There are also fears that the Abu Sayyaf -- whose specialty remains kidnapping and ransom -- in the Southern Philippines is also tying-up with the Daesh , resurrecting JI demands for an Islamic caliphate across Southeast Asia . <p> A separate report quoted national police spokesman Anton Charliyan as saying the East Indonesian Mujahidin terrorist group , known by its Indonesian acronym MIT and led by Santoso , one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from ISIS , which is also calling for attacks on Western targets . <p> He said ISIS was spreading its propaganda across five Indonesian provinces -- East Java , Lampung , Central Sulawesi , South Sulawesi , and West Sulawesi . <p> " The Santoso group is part of the ISIS network . You can see that the Poso terror group even has anti-tank weapons , " he said . " It 's not easy to break into the terrorist lair , but we keep on trying . " <p> It 's worth being cautious about linking any one of these groups to Wednesday 's Jakarta attacks . Take MIT , for example : An IHS Jane 's 360 assessment from November cautioned that " there is no indication that Santoso 's group has the capacity to carry out attacks in the capital , especially against well-protected state targets . " Just because terrorist groups exist domestically in Indonesia does n't mean they were responsible for particular attacks . <p> But if any of these groups were to begin functioning as an ISIS affiliate in Indonesia , and launch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a serious concern -- especially if they linked up with Indonesians who got training from ISIS headquarters in Syria . The ISIS threat to Indonesia may not be huge , but it is real . <h> Forgot username ? <h> Almost done , <p> By becoming a registered user , you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that you have read our Privacy Policy . <h> Authenticating <h> Great ! <p> Choose an available username to complete sign up . <p> In order to provide our users with a better overall experience , we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience .
