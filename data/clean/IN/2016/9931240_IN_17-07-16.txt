ask any start-up founder and ceo how big her company is and she is bound to rattle off revenue , cash-flows and projected profits . but ask her if her founding team includes a finance expert , chances are that the answer is ' no ' .  " given the emphasis on finance , valuations and million-dollar dreams that entrepreneurs set out with , it is ironical that too few start-ups actually have finance as an in-house function , " said sachin sancheti , chief technology officer and founder at the 18-month old cloud-service provider scalable solutions . " i have not yet met or heard of a technology start-up that has a finance expert as one of the co-founders . " this , he attributes to the fact that business ideas , which go on to become business offerings , typically emerge from technologists and business folks . " before we start out on our own , we tend to meet with and ideate with those like ourselves in technology or project management teams . and rarely does a finance person participate in those sessions relative , a qualified accountant , was willing to bet his all on scalable and wanted to be part of the founding team . " you need a co-founder you trust and with a close relative , trust comes first . "  for the now 20-strong team that his business is , mr. sancheti said , " we did not need to outsource processes such as salary payment and filing of tax returns . we knew exactly what laws to comply with . " all this , he said , helped him focus on servicing his customers very early in the business . but now that he is ready to grow and seek investment , he feels the need for a financial ' strategist ' even if only outsourced . " i want someone to tell me how to account for the numbers and how to present my finances to an investor . "  here 's where the concept of the outsourced cfo comes in .  alok subudhi , who founded thinkways , a company in the area of mobile apps and software as a service , said in his early days as entrepreneur . according to him , having a cfo , in-house or outsourced , is priceless . thinkways started in 2005 , and was sold to vattikutti ventures in 2011 , mr. subudhi said that if he started up all over again , he would rope in a finance person as partner from day one . " we too started off thinking that an accountant would do to take care of our vouchers . only as we grew and sought investor money , did we feel the need to better present our balance sheet and did we realise the importance of a finance person . "  financial strategy  in mr. subudhi 's case , the finance expert happened to be jayant tiwari who calls himself the outsourced cfo . mr. tiwari , was financial consultant , investment banker and legal advisor all rolled into one , according to mr. subudhi .  " from categorising the money you put into the company between expenses and investments , to tax-law compliance to saving for a rainy day , all of these were brought home to of diktats that mr. tiwari had for thinkways was to set apart 10 per cent of net profits for an unforeseen expenditure . " he ensured that a separate bank account was created for this amount . in time , this became a matter of discipline for us . " mr. subudhi realised the value of this discipline when unexpected emergencies cropped up . " imagine being able to lend a lumpsum to a colleague in dire need of finances during a medical emergency . in a small team , these things matter a great deal . "  the strategy part came later , for mr. subudhi . thinkways ' client vattikutti ventures was interested in a buy-out . " we went back and forth a bit . at one point it seemed like the deal would not go through . " differences cropped up on whether the deal would be an outright acquisition or what is now called an ' aqui-hire ' -- ie , the business , brand and employees alone would shift to the buyer . " our outsourced cfo represented us to the buyer in all , the transaction would have fallen through , said mr. subudhi .  the ocfo  mr. tiwari , whose email id includes ' ocfo ' ( for outsourced cfo ) , said , " it 's easy to do the accounting -- the recording of a company 's history in rupees . " a cfo should be able to tell the management team how to look at its finances , as a tool to where it wants to go , as well as an accurate reflection of the context of events it records , he said . " routine accounting captures the events but rarely the context . "  business strategy is easy to understand . but how exactly does mr. tiwari contribute to financial strategy ? " if an entrepreneur has spent rs.60 lakh in his first year of operations , a first-timer would categorise this as an expense , in all probability . " he explained that for an entrepreneur , a majority of that amount would have gone into developing a proof-of-concept , integrating pieces of software and creating a platform . all that , emphasised both revenues and returns over time , well beyond the financial year .  " the amount spent on rentals and peripheral infrastructure , would be current operating expenditure . " this may sound basic , but many entrepreneurs fail to draw the distinction in their financials , as they busy themselves with building a product or finding customers . according to him , there are clear , statutory guidelines to draw such distinctions . " with a little thought , the company accurately reflect the loss in the first year to be rs.10 lakh or less , instead of rs.60 lakh ! " the financials will then reflect the investment in its future , accurately at the rs.50 lakh level . could not agree more , said b sriram , founder of 8-year old software services company contus . he said , " even though i am a commerce graduate , i was focused on developing my business . " the first time he felt the need to better present his finances was when contus was setting up its office in the u.s. once the cfo function was outsourced , key for contus . " merely understanding debit and credit did not help us . our finance partner mentoris was able to identify where our money was going . " mr. sriram also said that capitalisation of product development expenses was something his finance partner guided him on .  this is where , said mr. tiwari , financial strategist is irreplaceable . imagine , he urges , the impact on the financials , profitability and balance-sheet of a company if as much structured thought is applied to these areas as is applied to prospects and operations .  but that does not mean to say that daily accounting does not have its place . typically , accounting service providers take on the duty of filing tax returns for the company , offering company secretary-ship through an associate firm , deduction of tax at source for their clients ' employees and even hr services such as salary payments .  accounting services  this also helps them spot opportunities to offer financial ' strategy ' when needed . this combination of offerings has helped popular chartered accountants ' place ' people the outsourced manpower concept in software services , these accounting firms charge per month per head . and should an opportunity arise , step in for financial strategy consulting as well , according to mr. k.g. suresh , " it is difficult for a company to retain a cfo full-time . we have seen it so many times -- where a young cfo is crucial to the organisation , but leaves for greener pastures , for the very reason -- that he is good . "  with the ability to attract and retain talent by offering young minds the opportunity to shift roles quickly in their career , mr. suresh 's accounting firm keeps a client 's boat steady . ask for a few numbers and you get a ball-park . " if it costs a client rs.10 lakh for outsourced accounting services , placing a couple of skilled accountants in their office costs them only rs.12 lakh a year . add to this the benefit of the top minds in the accountants ' firm being at hand for financial strategy consulting . " for instance , he and his . " a client of ours wished to get listed on the stock exchanges . the initial public offering , or ipo , was their first thought . it requires going through quite a few processes before your shares finally list on the exchanges . we spotted , and helped facilitate the merger with another firm that was listed but was in financially bad shape . " acquiring the listed company allowed the aspirant to meet its goal of having its shares traded on the stock exchange . suresh 's accounting firm services between 12 and 15 clients at any given time .  corporate services  some have scaled up even further to offer outsourced cfo services . mycfo offers services in strategy and governance , formulating business plans , participating in annual budgets , fund-raising through stake sale or raising loans and business process improvements . this allows them to tap clients across various sizes , from early-stage to mid-sized companies . according to murali r , vice-president , mycfo , " customers could even include listed companies that come to us as an interim measure . the decision size , stage at which the company is or a timeline . if the company derives value out of the outsourcing arrangement , the relationship could continue for long . " with 150 full-time people , experience of accountants ranging from 3 to 30 years , mycfo sees what it calls a ' massive ' opportunity in the indian market .  " we are talking of 60,000 companies in india with a turnover of rs.100 crore and above . " add to the mix multinationals , start-ups and private-equity backed companies . " the availability and quality of finance manpower is just not adequate . this gap is not going to go away for the next 20 years . " in effect , he said , even with " 10-15 high-quality cfo services firms , the demand will still be left unmet . "  global opportunity  some service providers have identified niche opportunities to offer services in specific geographies beyond india . sundaram business services works with accounting firms to offer business process services to clients . according to rajesh venkat , ceo , sbs , " id-sized over time , they want to move into consulting and be positioned as cutting-edge experts in the accounting space . " this , he said , offered players like sbs an opportunity to offer adjunct bpo services . he cited sbs 's domain knowledge as critical to its work with accounting firms in australia . " in accounts finalisation , not everything is template-based . there could be quirks and nuances in an industry that is specific to that sector . in an industry , marketing spends are spread over a period and revenues happen only in short bursts . one would know this unique aspect only if you are clued in to the industry . "  according to him , " this is the start of a trend . along with accounting firms , bpos offer total finance functions to small and mid-sized firms especially where they can not afford a full-fledged cfo . it is a smarter model . "  outsourcing the finance function is a smart model for small firms . which is one of the reasons why , despite being the sole founder , sancheti his company . " ceo or cfo , one can not ' recruit ' a co-founder . minds have to click and there should be chemistry . " till then , it is opportunities galore for the outsourced cfo .  1 . comments will be moderated by the hindu editorial team . 2 . comments that are abusive , personal , incendiary or irrelevant can not be published . 3 . please write complete sentences . do not type comments in all capital letters , or in all lower case letters , or using abbreviated text .
