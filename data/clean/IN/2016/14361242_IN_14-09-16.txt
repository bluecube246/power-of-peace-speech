raskar , 46 , is the co-inventor of radical imaging solutions including femto-photography -- an ultra-fast imaging system that can see around corners -- low-cost eye-care solutions for the developing world , and a camera that allows users to read pages of a book without opening the cover .  " we are thrilled to honour ramesh raskar , whose breakthrough research is impacting how we see the world , " said dorothy lemelson , chair of the lemelson foundation , in a statement .  the technology , currently in development for commercialisation , uses ultrafast imaging to capture light at 1 trillion frames per second , allowing the camera to create slow motion videos of light in motion .  " ramesh 's femto-photography work not only has the potential to transform industries ranging from internal medicine to transportation safety , it is also helping to inspire a new generation of inventors to tackle the biggest problems of our time , " lemelson added .  " everyone has the power to solve problems and through peer-to-peer co-invention and purposeful collaboration , we can solve raskar , who is also associate professor at mit .  he plans to use a portion of the lemelson-mit prize money to launch a new effort using peer-to-peer invention platforms that offer new approaches for helping young people in multiple countries to co-invent in a collaborative way , the statement read .  bharadia , 28 , a doctorate from stanford university and an alumnus of the indian institute of technology ( iit ) at kanpur , uttar pradesh , has been awarded for his contribution to radio waves .  " bharadia has been chosen for the 2016 paul baran young scholar award for his contribution to send and receive radio ( wireless ) signals , including mobile telephony and data on the same channel ( wave ) , " the marconi society said in a statement .  " bharadia 's research disproved a long-held assumption that it is not possible for a radio to receive and transmit on the same frequency band because of the resulting interference , " the statement said .  the marconi young scholar award includes $4,000 ( rs. 2,67,870 ) prize and will receive the award at a ceremony in mountain view , california , on november 2 .  bharadia 's technology can be used in india to build relays which can listen to signals from a cellular tower , transmit them instantly and extend the range across the country .
