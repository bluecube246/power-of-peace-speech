<p> Swedish researchers have found that obesity might not increase the risk of heart attack or premature death , in a finding that goes against accepted belief . <p> In the study which involved identical twins , researchers looked at cases where one twin was overweight or obese and the other was trimmer . <p> " The heavier twin had a lower risk of heart attack or death than the leaner twin . However , as expected , the heavier twin had a higher risk of diabetes , " said lead researcher Peter Nordstrom , chief physician in the department of community medicine and rehabilitation at Umea University . <p> " Lifestyle factors that decrease the amount of fatness may not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or death , although it will reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes , " Nordstrom added . <p> He added , as identical twins were genetically the same , they provided a unique tool for evaluating risks associated with obesity independent of genetics . <p> According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , obesity was linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of cancer . <p> According to the CDC , obesity-related illness cost the US about $147 billion annually . <p> Around 5 per cent of the twins in the study group reported a heart attack during 12 years of follow-up . <p> Among twins with lower BMI , about 16 per cent died as against 14 per cent of twins with higher BMI . However , heavier twins were around twice as likely to develop diabetes over the study 's length . <p> " What the study does show is that there 's a strong association between obesity and diabetes , which leads us to conclude that weight reduction interventions can be more effective against diabetes than when it comes to reducing the risk of heart attack and mortality , " said Nordstr ? m in a statement . <p> Researchers looked at medical records of more than 4,000 identical twin pairs previously enrolled in a long-running population study . The middle-aged pairs who were tracked for 12 years , had one twin with a higher body mass index ( BMI ) than the other . <p> The researchers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attacks or premature death between the group of twins with higher BMI and the group with lower BMI , even when only obese individuals or twin pairs where the weight difference were considered . <p> They did find a sustained link between Type 2 diabetes risk and higher BMI which supported earlier research .
