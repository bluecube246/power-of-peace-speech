<h> DC Debate : Kanhaiya 's ' spirit of freedom ' speech <p> DECCAN CHRONICLE . <p> Published Mar 6 , 2016 , 1:55 am IST <p> Updated Mar 6 , 2016 , 1:55 am IST <p> Mr Modi came to power riding piggyback , in part , on a social media wave created by the BJP . <p> JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar with the union Vice President Shehla Rashid ( L ) and Rama Naga ( R ) who is facing sedition charges , addresses a news conference at the JNU campus in New Delhi . ( Photo : PTI ) <p> Struggle for azaadi in India <p> Bipin Sebastian <p> On Thursday midnight , amid calls for azaadi reverberating on the campus , JNU had its tryst with Kanhaiya Kumar , the unlikely rustic youth from Bihar who has become the pivot of the Opposition to what PM Narendra Modi represents . Never before , probably since the days of Independence , has the term azaadi caught the imagination and attention of so many in the country . <p> Mr Kumar and his friends have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Indian nation state , as the bhakts would want others to believe . It also means freedom from injustice and discrimination meted out by the state , especially towards the marginalised sections of society , be it a Dalit , a woman , or someone belonging to the LGBTQ community . <p> Mr Modi and his bhakts have been caught on the wrong foot in unc-harted territory , ever since his government started muzzling the voice of students . From FTII in Pune to UoH to JNU , his government has failed to deal with opposition in acceptable ways . <p> Several student pro-tests have rocked autho-ritarian governments in many parts of the world . The first prominent challenge that the communist state of China faced was from students at the Tiananmen Square , which unfortunately led to mass massacre by the military . <p> Mr Modi came to power riding piggyback , in part , on a social media wave created by the BJP . For now , Mr Kumar and his campus crowd seem to be turning the tables on Mr Modi . <p> Mr Kumar used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegations made against him and sounded " politically correct " . From the " doctored " video used to frame him , to accusations of being anti-national , to calling the bluff in invoking the image of the selfless jawan to spread malice against student protesters , he tore into the arguments of the rival side . Mr Kumar 's speech contained the voice of those who do not exactly fall within the boundaries set by the narrow narrative of an ideal nationalist citizen , mou-lded in the image of a north Indian upper-caste Hindu male . Branding someone as anti-national is turning into a manifestation of caste discrimination in a neo-casteist society . The dominant sections of society used it to fervently defend the existing power structures that are very much in their favour . No wonder they easily used it to brand and dismiss Rohit Vemula and the Ambedkarite politics as being anti-national . <p> UoH and JNU are different issues . Still , than-ks to Mr Kumar and his friends , azaadi has come to embody the voice of the " other " within the Indian state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want freedom in India , " said the JNUSU president . <p> Speech shows azaadi exists <p> Dr Y.L. Srinivas <p> Dr B.R. Ambedkar 's Writings and Spee-ches in its Volume III , has an interesting piece titled ' Buddha or Karl Marx ' , in which he ends the presentation with the following words . " ( That ) society has been aiming to lay a new foundation was summarised by the French Revolution in three words , ' Fraternity , Liberty and Equality ' . We welcome the Rus-sian Revolution because it aims to produce equality . Equality will be of no value without fraternity or liberty . It seems that the three can coexist only if one follows the way of the Buddha . Communism can give one but not all . " <p> Kanhaiya Kumar 's call for " azaadi within India " after his release from bail thus reflects the yawning gap between rhetoric and reality based on Dr Ambedkar 's own observations . Furthermore , Mr Kumar 's call for uniting the " blue " of Dr Ambedkar and the " red " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an ideology can only go so far . In fact , Dr Ambedkar felt that humanity wants not only the economic values but also the spiritual values to be retained . The ideology of communism paid no attention to spiritual values . The idea of a nation and especially of India is one of the largest and most enduring spiritual values and the celebration of the event at JNU on February 9 was nothing but an attempt to trample on this idea . Thus the call for azaadi from hunger , capitalism and Brahmanism , that Kan-haiya made after his return from jail , was a well-crafted attempt to obfuscate discussion from the core issue . <p> As a student union president , Mr Kumar should have shown zero tolerance to the raising of slogans against India and the attempt to make a hero out of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhat . Instead , he chose to waffle on it . In interviews , he dodged questions on Afzal Guru and the anti-India slogans , and was elusive when questions were posed on Afzal Guru . The slogans are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others the right to free speech . When overt attempts are being made to destabilise the Indian Union , it is the responsibility of every individual and the JNU fraternity to condemn it rather than condone it . <p> The issues which Mr Kumar is seeking freedom from are not specific to India . For a nation to fight socio-economic-cultural disparities , a prerequisite is that it has to survive as a nation . We will not be able to fight disparities by lending credence to the arguments being put forth by those indulging in a proxy war against India from within and without . Freedom within India exists and Mr Kumar 's speech is a standing testimony to that . The imperative before us is to free universities from fissiparous tendencies .
