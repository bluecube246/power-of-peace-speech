The lower the score , the less the hunger . Photo : Indranil Bhoumik/Mint  The International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) brings out a report called the Global Hunger Index every year . It is what its name implies -- an index that captures the extent of hunger in the world . How does India fare on this index ? More specifically , how has India done after it liberalized its economy ?  The hunger index for India , says the IFPRI , fell from 46.4 in 1992 to 28.5 in 2016 . The lower the score , the less the hunger . How good is that performance ? Let 's compare it better than Zambia . Zambia had a score of 47.1 in 1992 , only a bit higher than India 's . But its score is 39 in 2016 , much worse than India 's . Pakistan 's score was 43.4 in 1992 and it is 33.4 now , so we 've done better than Pakistan . But should we be scrounging cold crumbs of comfort by comparing ourselves to Zambia or Pakistan or for that matter North Korea and Ethiopia , other countries whose performance on the hunger index is worse than ours ?  Instead , let 's look at some of the countries that have done better than us . Take Mali , a country that contains large expanses of the Sahara . Its score was 50.2 in 1992 , well above India 's . By 2016 , its hunger index was at 28.1 , a bit better than India 's .  Take Malawi , a landlocked country in the south-eastern Africa . In 1992 , its hunger index was 57.6 , far above India 's . By 2016 , it was at 26.9 , much better than which too has a better score on the hunger index than India 's , are much poorer than us . In 2015 , Mali 's GDP per capita , in purchasing power parity terms , in constant 2011 international dollars , was $2,285 , according to World Bank indicators . Malawi 's was $1,113 . Uganda 's was $1,717 . India 's was $5,730 . Let 's also not forget that we have had some of the highest growth rates in the world . Was n't it supposed to trickle down and eliminate hunger ? Countries that are far from being the toast of international investors have done a much better job of feeding their people .  What about countries nearer home ? Look away from China , because even in 1992 its score in the hunger index was better than India 's score in 2016 .  Vietnam 's hunger index was 41.5 in 1992 , compared to India 's 46.4 , while it 's 14.5 now , against India 's 28.5 . They 've beaten us easily , although Vietnam 's per capita income is lower than India , more commonly known as Laos , improved its score on the hunger index from 52.2 in 1992 to 28.1 in 2016 . Laos 's per capita income is also lower than India 's . Cambodia saw its hunger index improve from 45.3 in 1992 to 21.7 in 2016 . That too is a much better performance than India 's .  Next door , we have the examples of Bangladesh and Nepal , both countries much poorer than India , which have better scores and ranks on the hunger index . And these countries have done a commendable job without the benefit of record growth rates , without billions of dollars of capital flowing into their stock markets , without any hype . The chart with this article should make us hang our heads in shame .  In the chart , India with a per capita GDP in PPP constant 2011 international dollars of $5,730 in 2015 is placed between Guinea , with a per capita income of $1,135 and Liberia , with a per capita income of $786 . The original chart in the Global Hunger Index report When did we see the most improvement in India 's hunger index ? In the eight years between 1992 and 2000 , it went down by 8.2 points .  Between 2000 and 2008 , it fell by a mere 2.2 points . And in the eight years between 2008 and 2016 , it went down by 7.5 points . It is strange that it fell the least during a time when we had an economic and stock market boom . That raises the heretical question : could there be something wrong with what we mean by development ? India 's place in the hunger index shows that economic growth alone is far from enough .  Will we soon see as much attention focused on improving our position on the hunger index as on the ease of doing business index ? Since he has just won the Nobel Prize for Literature , I ca n't resist quoting Bob Dylan : How many ears must one man have/Before he can hear people cry ? /Yes , how many deaths will it take till he knows/That too many people have died ? financial markets .
