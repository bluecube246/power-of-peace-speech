<h> Microsoft signed a big deal that shows there 's still plenty of life left in MSN yet <p> MSN , Microsoft 's web portal and the default homepage for the Internet Explorer browser , announced on Tuesday it has signed a multi-year deal with content recommendation platform Taboola . <p> Neither company would comment on the size of the deal , but it will see Taboola take over the content recommendations on MSN in the 50 markets in which it operates . If you browse MSN.com today , you 'll see Taboola content recommendations from publishers and advertisers right at the top of the homepage , and within articles . They 're tailored to each user , so it 's unlikely any two users would see the same homepage . <p> MSN has also taken on Taboola 's " audience exchange product , " which will see its technology used to predict which Microsoft services should be promoted to users . So a user browsing MSN on a Windows 8 device might be served an ad prompting them to upgrade , whereas an Android user might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of an app recommendation powered by Taboola on MSN . <p> In addition , MSN 's editors will be taking up Taboola 's Newsroom product , which allows them to live-test different content , creative , and placements to different sets of users to see which performs best ( known as A/B testing . ) <p> In June last year , Microsoft announced it was handing over all the direct-sales of ads on MSN to AOL , while ad tech company AppNexus would sell the programmatic ads on the site . <p> Taboola has now become the main source of content recommendation and personalization on MSN ( Microsoft still has smaller deals with other partners like Outbrain , but Taboola will power the majority of content recommendations on MSN , plus offering the additional personalization and exchange products . ) Microsoft is handing off more responsibility for revenue generation on MSN to a third-party in order to concentrate on using the website to promote its products . <p> Microsoft is using every web asset it can ( through partnerships if needs be ) to promote Windows products . MSN still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , according to Millward Brown 's Compete.com analytics service ( see chart below ) - that it can market Microsoft products to . <p> The priority with MSN has shifted from making money from selling other people 's ads ( which it still does via AOL and AppNexus , ) to making money by promoting its own assets . <h> It could help drive MSN 's profitability <p> Speaking to Business Insider , Joe Cepollina , Microsoft principal program management lead for the Windows Universal Store , said MSN has increasingly become a " strategic product " for Microsoft because it drives users its other products and services . <p> Cepollina said : " Over the last 12 months MSN has been a profitable offering , since we turned over the product strategy and it became part of a broader organization known as the Windows Universal Store . It 's in a very strategic place at this point in time and doing a great job in helping drive the Microsoft brand . We probably , definitely , could n't have said the same 18 months ago . " <p> Cepollina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's clear that the decision not to focus on original content and to outsource advertising to third-parties will have led to some efficiencies . <h> This is huge for Taboola <p> This partnership marks one of the biggest ( if not the biggest ) deal in 9-year-old Taboola 's history . The size of MSN 's audience means Taboola will now become the number one syndicated advertising platform in the US in terms of reach , Taboola CEO Adam Singolda predicts . In November , Taboola was number two in terms of reach in the US , behind Google . <p> What 's also interesting for Taboola is that it won the bulk of the MSN business as the result of a competitive pitch , which Cepollina said had been ongoing for around five or six months . <p> While MSN will still continue using a number of other partners in this area - including Outbrain , which will continune its long-running deal to offer content recommendation on some areas of the MSN site - winning business from competitors will see Taboola boosting its market share . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful its new business pitch is to advertisers and future publisher partners . <p> In addition , Cepollina said the partnership also helped Taboola develop better products : " One of the core benefits of working with Taboola was their empathy and willingness to partner with us like part of the development team . They understand our business objectives and worked with us closely and iteratively to come up with solutions that did n't just play to their core product strengths , but really extended their product strengths .
