Earth is in the middle of a ' shooting gallery ' and a new NASA initiative is trying to protect us  Right now Earth is surrounded by over 13,500 chunks of space rock , and if one of them bumps into us , the damage could be enough to flatten cities , wipe countries off the map , or even cause global extinctions .  " We are in a shooting gallery , " Nahum Melamed , a project manager with the Aerospace Corporation , recently said during an event for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in California .  Now NASA is getting serious about the potential threat by creating the Planetary Defense Coordination Office ( PDCO ) . The office will track the potentially dangerous objects , warn us of any close passes , and continue working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) and the Department of Defense to figure out what we 'll do if one ever heads directly for Earth .  Right now NASA keeps tabs on these threats through its near-Earth object ( NEO ) other celestial rock passes within 1.3 astronomical units of the sun ( 1 au is 93 million miles , or the distance from the Earth to the sun ) , then NASA tags it as an NEO . If it comes within 0.05 astronomical units of Earth ( a little more than 4.5 million miles ) , then it 's labeled as a potentially hazardous NEO .  NASA has already recorded over 13,500 NEOs , and over 1,600 are potentially hazardous .  You can tell why Melamed says we 're in a shooting gallery in the map of near-Earth objects by the Armagh Observatory below . These NEOs are orbiting the sun , but they move faster than Earth and their orbits are less stable so could potentially come careening in our direction .  At the center of the yellow circled area is Earth ( the yellow dot in the center is the sun ) . All the green dots represent asteroids at a safe distance , while red and yellow dots represent a ring of potentially dangerous asteroids :  Luckily , all of the NEOs we Earth within the next century , according to NASA , and the next potentially dangerous ( though still not at all likely ) encounter wo n't happen until 2027 .  However , sometimes NASA misses an NEO , like the one that unexpectedly flew past Earth on Halloween in 2015 . And even though there 's a low likelihood that Earth will get hit , asteroids come hurtling toward Earth at hundreds of miles per hour , and the potential damage is not something to take lightly . ( Remember what happened to the dinosaurs ? )  We know that these impacts have happened regularly ( if not often ) throughout Earth 's history because there 's evidence buried in rock layers on the planet . But impacts are incredibly difficult to predict . They do n't happen in any kind of predictable pattern or strike in a predictable spot . And if one ever heads right for us , we do n't have a plan .  " While there are no known impact threats at this time , the 2013 Chelyabinsk super-fireball and the recent ' Halloween to remain vigilant and keep our eyes to the sky , " John Grunsfeld said in a NASA press release .  Most importantly , the newly formed PDCO will be working on a way to redirect a dangerous asteroid should one ever head for the Earth .  One potential plan NASA 's Asteroid Redirect Mission concept . This plan would use the gravity of another object to tug the incoming NEO slightly off its original orbital path . Other possible plans that PDCO will work in include involve a spacecraft that will fire at an NEO to deflect it .  If all else fails , then NASA will be in direct contact with FEMA to get us as prepared as possible .  " Even if intervention is not possible , NASA would provide expert input to FEMA about impact timing , location and effects to inform emergency response operations , " according to a NASA post . " In turn , FEMA would handle the preparations and response planning related to the consequences of atmospheric entry or impact to U.S. communities .
