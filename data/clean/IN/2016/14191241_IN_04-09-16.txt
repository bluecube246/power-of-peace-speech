Living in the Shadow of Guns

<h> Living in the Shadow of Guns <p> Back in 2013 , a lifelong wish of one of my friends came true . He finally landed in Srinagar at a time when the gun barrels were eerily silent and the Valley was passing through a period of fleeting peace . My friend spent his sojourn nestled in the comfortable refuge of the snow-capped mountains of Himalayas , overlooking the untroubled waters of a vast lake , fringed with lotus flowers and terraced Mughal-era gardens . However , before he bid adieu he stumbled on a familiar platitude , " At least , Kashmiris should be thankful to India for the development palpable at the ground level . I did n't feel any security threat here but attained peace of mind " . He further continued , " Look at my country , you will find only dilapidated buildings left after bomb blasts , the rubble yet untouched , ruins of the magnificent buildings of yore and what not " . Ever since I befriended him , I used to narrate him our version of paradise full of misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation in Kashmir , I too was born in the shadow of the guns . The saga of events under which I was brought up left a deep impression on the way I think , I behave , I conduct myself and on everything about my life . One incident which left the greatest mark on my psyche was the Sopore massacre . <p> It was the cold chilly morning of January 6 , 1993 . That morning the air of Sopore seemed restless . We had travelled to Sopore , 50 km away from my hometown to visit a doctor to get my grandmother examined . On our way to see the doctor we heard some gunshots . They were not uncommon in Kashmir at that time . As we started to dodge amidst the erratic trajectories of the bullets , we found ourselves trapped in this fury and swiftly we tried to run for safety . Suddenly , the BSF regiment started appearing towards us raining bullets from all sides . We leaned on the earth as bullets went past us . The verses of the holy book we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was thinking that death was only a moment away . My mother in desperation had come out of her parent 's home looking for us among the dead bodies in the graveyard . By some miracle , we all survived with minor injuries . She went into state of shock and never recovered from it completely . We later learnt that 55 civilians were allegedly killed by the BSF and 450 shops were burnt down to ashes after militants ambushed the BSF patrol . This is just my story . Every person in Kashmir can effectively relate to this incident . Some live to tell their stories while others die before they can narrate it . <p> Every house in my homeland is a portrait of loss and gloom . The mother of my next door neighbour used to eulogise her own strength in form of her bravest , eldest son . He was tall , handsome and dynamic personality of our locality . When he walked , all eyes used to be on him . In the din of morning in 90s , we heard a loud cry emanating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son had been killed in an encounter . When his body was brought back home , his mother lost her consciousness the moment she stared at the corpse of her fallen son . I was a kid back then , but the unfathomable tragedy of a mother got etched in my memory and even after so many years I can still feel pain every time I try to recollect the broken fragments of that moment . <p> When she recovered after some time , she smeared his blood over her whole body to preserve the last memory . Ladies showed flowers over him while mother kept singing songs of his bravery . His old father carried his coffin to the graveyard for his final farewell . Later his other son was interrogated to get the information of his eldest brother . He never got married . She now fights this arduous battle every day from last 20 years like other mothers who have faced similar misfortune . <p> The Pashtun tribe my friend belongs to has produced girls like Malala Yousafzai , the youngest noble laureate for standing up for girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constant fear . During the militancy years in 90s , we were instructed to turn lights off after break of dusk ( locally called night out ) . After the laborious day at school , many would spend around two hours of night to study with candle in one hand and books in the other hand . When going for school we constantly feared bomb blasts that could explode anytime . Now our education institutes are being converted into army camps . Our children have n't seen a glimpse of school for nearly two months due to curfew . The year of 2016 will be remembered in history books as the ' year of blinded eyes ' . While the world silently watches , the paradise is being turned into ' country of blind ' . How could anyone expect such blinded and traumatised children to hold books and computers in their hands ? <p> The date of my marriage was fixed a year ago . Two months ago , I got married on the strictest day of curfew . On this joyous event of my life , a pall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup outside as a barricade to thwart any civilian movement . From our college days the same friend had planned along with his wife to come from Afghanistan for my marriage . How could he have come when my close relatives two kilometers away from my home could n't see me leaving for the Baraat ? <p> More than the ruins of Kabul , he feels sadder about prevalent grief of paradise on earth ! He finally concluded that " Kashmir is as volatile as soap bubble and when external force acts the bubble bursts and its cosmetic peace dies . Kashmir is no longer a paradise now . " He understood only one dimension of Kashmir after visiting during the peaceful days , like most of the tourists do , thinking " All is well with Kashmir " . <p> We profess democracy but rule by force in Kashmir-unless we have auto-suggested ourselves into believing that the two general elections under Bakshi Sahib had expressed the will of the people or that Sadiq government is based on popular support , except for a minority of pro-Pakistan traitors .
