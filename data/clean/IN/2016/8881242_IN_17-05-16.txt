The ' why ' of elder woes , in a book  CHENNAI : India is changing -- jobs , family structures , longevity and globalisation are contributing to the fluctuations in the stereotypical image of elders in our society .  " Studies show that around 32% of elders in India are abused , " says Dr V S Natarajan , a geriatric specialist and Padmashree awardee.Here the question arises as to how this problem can be tackled with a sense of mutual cooperation between the elders and youngsters and not resort to abuse .  Dr Natarajan 's latest book Generation Gap examines the social problems faced by the elderly today , with case studies and solutions to support these problems .  " In the past 20 years , health problems were more common among the elderly . Today , there is more awareness about health , but social problems are becoming more strong with the disintegration of the joint family , " he says .  Money is often the biggest factor for most forms of abuse , says the specialist , who encountered as a house call doctor .  Once he was called to visit an elderly patient in Anna Nagar , who lived with his son and daughter-in-law . " When I went there , he was lying in a small room alone . On seeing me , the old man immediately spat at me . Before I could react , his son started beating him up violently , " he recalls .  After sending the son out , the old man apologised saying his mental state was not good because of being abused . " The man told me the son 's only reason for calling me was to check how long he would live and when he will inherit my property , not to help me get better , " he says .  Apart from the rare physical abuse cases , the other two forms -- psychological and verbal are far more common , says Natarajan , who feels that money has taken a toll on everything .  " With the IT boom , people are earning more and they want to spend more and enjoy money on elder care . Also , real estate value has become so high , that many elders are pressurised into selling their properties , and are abused if they do not do it , " he says .  The solutions are not easy , and youngsters too can not be blamed all the time , he adds . " Caregivers also have problems , especially if someone is living till 90 , it does become difficult . But it needs to be handled sensitively . "  He urges that people should take care of their health better in younger days while they simultaneously save money for their old age to avoid their dependency on their children.The book , co-authored by Hema Narasimhan , will be released today at 6 pm at Vani Mahal , T Nagar .
