<p> Many tourists routinely throng South Mumbai to witness the relics of Victorian architecture but Ballard Estate , the European style early twentieth century business district , is usually not on their list . They miss out on this commercial area on the eastern waterfront that has many treasures including the precinct with its uniform architectural style , especially the buildings on street corners , the cast-iron porches and the central open space after each row of buildings . The area is infamous for turning into a ' ghost town ' after office hours . The Mumbai Port Trust , which owns the Estate , has since January initiated a weekend street festival to open the area up for citizens and tourists to explore . <p> The ' ghost town ' tag to Ballard Estate has not always been there . The Estate was a bustling hub of activity , with a railway station called Ballard Pier , a passenger berth inside the port and many commercial establishments of big companies , mainly shipping and industries . <p> Under the British rule , in 1914 , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a dock along the seashore . <p> " To build Alexandra dock which is today known as Indira dock , a large amount of soil had to be excavated by the then Bombay Port Trust . At that point , the problem before the authorities was on where the large quantity of soil could be dumped . It was then dumped in the low-lying , marshy land which is today known as the Ballard Estate , " said Gautam Dey , a senior official at the Mumbai Port Trust . Around 22 acres of this reclaimed land , which was a site for dumping the excavated soil , was then flattened and developed into the Ballard Estate . <p> It gets its name after the first chairman of the Bombay Port Trust , Colonel John Archibald Ballard . It was the city 's first and the country 's second planned commercial area with land given on lease to companies for varied periods of time , extending up to 99 years . <p> Though the land was given to different companies , uniformity of architecture was ensured , recalls Dey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known for his contribution to other significant buildings including the Gateway of India and the Prince of Wales Museum , known today as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sangrahalaya . " Willet who developed a whole master plan for every building ensured that there was a uniformity in architecture . Each lease covenant laid down rules like how tall a building could be , which kind of stone could be used , where should the signage be placed . This ensured that the area remains the most visually homogenous Edwardian Neo-classical architecture in the city , " said renowned architect Abha Narain Lambah . The area was declared as a heritage sub-precinct of the Fort precinct in 1995 when the Heritage Regulations were notified in the city . <p> Another significant relic is the war memorial at a street junction close to the Indira docks . The memorial with winged lions at its base stands in commemoration of the contribution of the then Bombay Port Trust in the World War I , including its employees who lost their lives in the war . <p> A brass plaque on the memorial contextualizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war through stating among other things the 1,87,0000 troops and personnel who embarked and disembarked at the docks during the war . <p> Buildings including the Darabshaw House , the Grand Hotel , Mackinnon Mackenzie remain prime attractions . The offices of many shipping companies , the headquarters of the Mumbai Port Trust , Raymond and the Irani eatery , Caf ? Britannia , continue to remain housed in the Estate . <p> Old timers say that with the development of new business areas including Nariman Point and more recently Bandra-Kurla complex , many industries shifted when their lease was over . After office hours , the area still continues to be bereft of people , save for some who take shelter in its deserted streets at night . Today , a walk into the area on a quiet afternoon during the weekend would make one witness to ongoing cricket matches or film shoots and more recently the Mumbai Ballard Estate festival which is hosted in a few streets on Saturdays and Sundays . <p> Have a comment or suggestion for Once Upon A Time ?
