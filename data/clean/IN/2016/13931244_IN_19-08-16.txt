PV Sindhu's silver medal raises hopes of a golden future

It would be great disservice to a talent as promising as PV Sindhu to say that the 21-year-old has given her best at this Olympics , and recalibrate her own hopes from self by adding that she would be content with a silver . For a country that had nothing at the Olympics for the first 13 days , PV Sindhu 's commanding march into the final was as good as gold . Except , PV Sindhu is such a big contender for gold at Tokyo that every step she takes from here on -- including how she processes this silver -- will be seen against that mark .  Carolina Marin , for one , had decided as soon as London wound down , that Rio was to be her Games . Great players deserve a post-mortem of their silvers -- it 's what has brought perennial silver man Lee Chong Wei his best chance for an Olympic gold , beating Lin Dan .  So while India 's expectations might be satiated from Sindhu , the badminton world is expecting grander stuff from her now a stunning run to World No 1 .  For Sindhu , now an Olympic silver medallist , suddenly all that inconsistency of the last few years feels irrelevant and the lack of Super Series titles seems a hollow quibble -- the final against Marin was a match to file away and keep just like she had so many other defeats that helped chisel her game and experience going into Rio .  On Friday , against Marin , Sindhu failed to attack the Spaniard 's backhand -- a weakness that can be a little confusing since she 's a left-hander . Against Nozomi Okuhara in the semifinals , Sindhu had attacked the Japanese girl 's backhand and ended the challenge marching into the final . Today , Sindhu would keep hitting at Marin 's forehand -- giving her easy plum chances to put away .  There were crosscourt smashes -- the ones that she did n't use as kills that became easy for Marin to pick because they lobbed onto her ready , busy , hyper forehand . The down the line smashes though -- that could have troubled Sindhu 's first set 21-19 win could float on and end in a victory .  Marin was two notches better on the day -- prancing around the court in easy movement and with a better shot selection and tactical nous at all times . Marin has that effect on players : she can cause panic by just being left-handed even before she starts her celebrating , yowling routine that actually gets her into a lot of perception trouble with the chair umpire .  But maybe it was Sindhu 's angle of shots -- that 's always been this -- going on the backhand of the right-hander , leaving a ferocious player like Marin free to run riot on her forehand .  The Spaniard would take the lead , and then even if she lost a few in a bunch , she always seemed to know she was capable of finishing it off . The first set was almost gifted to a pugnacious Sindhu who was there to pounce onto it as soon as it appeared . Marin 's errors and some high-risk stubborn badminton at the net meant in fact has been throughout this Olympic . Not many would guess she was at her first .  Yet she will kick herself for not exploiting Marin 's backhand chinks enough . Marin fundamentally has always found it comfortable to play Sindhu because the attack does n't dent her too much , though Gopi and Sindhu had some effective plans to stay in the long rallies and plant doubts in Marin 's mind .  Sindhu would retrieve well , but her smash -- whether opening or the kill -- found a wall in Marin 's dogged defense , even as her backhand side was n't tested .  Looking back , a silver for Sindhu , a dark horse this Olympics seems extra-ordinary . Yet looking ahead , the next rung of bigger titles will be expected to show up in succession now .  Yet , Sindhu 's left a mark on the world . Affable and conducting herself with a lot of grace , Sindhu is a popular figure on the circuit and wears her achievements lightly . She 's buddies with some of the Chinese and from a Chinese masseuse .  It has helped that Saina Nehwal has left her a clutch of goals to chase , and she has shown she can outdo India 's best -- Padukone , Gopichand or Nehwal -- for she has the talent and the flair and the physique .  Technically there 's much to learn that will make her an even bigger player . Taking time between points , managing her centre of gravity and her speed . And the inconsistency is expected to be shrugged off .  Yet India will not forget her long , hard paced rallies , the power with which she played and that dipping smash . The smash of a champ . Worthy of a gold medal .
