The pain of ignorance  -- By Sadhguru Apr 14 , 2016 06:32 pm  Most people do n't know the pain of ignorance because they cover themselves up with their belief systems . Belief systems never liberate you but they will give you solace for today . " Oh ! God is looking after me , my father 's atman is looking after me . " Such beliefs will make you sleep well but they will not liberate you . They will only entangle you .  If you are seeking liberation , then you must see everything stark , the way it is . The reality is , you do n't know a damn thing about yourself . If you come to that reality and you understand the pain of not knowing who you are , where you come from or where you will go , but still go on as if everything is ok , it is a terrible thing to do . If that terrible thing sinks into you and really torments you , then you are willing to do anything to know right here .  If it was sitting on the mountain , then the issue of whether you can climb the mountain or not would arise . When it is sitting right here , the question of whether you can get it or not is not the issue . Whether you want it and how much you want it is the only issue .  When you keep on lying to yourself with your belief systems about God , soul , atman and paramataman -- things that you have never seen or experienced -- then the longing to know is not there . That is why it is not known .  ( Sadhguru is a yogi , mystic and visionary , and a prominent spiritual leader .
