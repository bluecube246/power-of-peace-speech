Straddling indie and mainstream

<p> Bejoy Nambiar has always had intriguing music in his films , his signature being an ensemble of exciting indie music talent and their sexy picturisations . The Mani Ratnam prot ? g ? won more fans for the way he used a re-imagined version of the Mohammad Rafi classic ' Khoya Khoya Chaand ' in Shaitan than for the film itself . <p> His next , David , followed suit . Nambiar can be credited to have ushered in the indie world into Hindi film music . Now , with Wazir , he is put somewhat outside his personal space . Wazir , being produced and written by Vidhu Vinod Chopra , has brought in his own favourite Bollywood regulars such as Shantanu Moitra . <p> It 's not that Nambiar has n't shown affinity towards popular film composers ; he worked with Anirudh Ravichander , the man behind ' Kolaveri Di ' in David . But when you hear ' Tere Bin ' , you find the imprint of Chopra 's previous collaborations with Moitra . <p> Moitra has the tendency to repeat himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will straightaway remind you of ' Ferari Mon ' , a song from one of Moitra 's best works , the Bengali film Antaheen . But the intention is pure and the song has its own identity . It is rendered with warmth and depth by Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghosal <p> Ankit Tiwary seems like a rather odd fit for a film by Nambiar . But a T-series favourite , with a knack for delivering hit sufi-rock style ballads , Tiwary thankfully does a pretty good job with ' Tu Mere Paas ' . Yes , he needs to experiment before his style reaches its expiry date , but he composes a likable , if slightly sentimental , song of love and melancholy . <p> It 's unfortunate that overuse of the word ' maula ' in songs has made it into a clich ? in the Hindi film music lexicon . ' Maula ' , a standard qawwali , thankfully sounds clutter-free because of some fresh arrangement by Moitra , and the chord changes are particularly effective . <p> My favourite is ' Khel Khel Mein ' , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best tracks of Delhi-based fusion band Advaita with a monologue by Bachchan ( first heard in the trailer of the film ) seems to be the kind of juxtaposition Nambiar enjoys . It makes for a very addictive , on-loop listen . <p> ' Tere Liye Mera Kareem ' , composed by Prashant Pillai , sounds grim , raw and powerful . Pillai makes great use of vocal harmony with the electric guitar riffs to compelling effect . The Wazir theme by Gaurav Godkhindi captures the pulse of a thriller . Expect it to underline crucial scenes and to certainly grow on you . <p> Overall , Wazir is a good album , one that has imagination , relevance for its narrative and that does n't seem to insult the tastes of listeners .
