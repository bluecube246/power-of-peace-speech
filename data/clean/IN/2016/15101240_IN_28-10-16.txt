<p> Raising three issues , IiAS said , " the first is the legality of the process , the second the decision itself , and finally , what happens now that Cyrus Mistry has been ousted ? For investors , while the third is more fundamental , for the group the first two also matter . " <p> While Tata Sons is an unlisted company and therefore accountable to a limited set of stakeholders , its actions affect the entire Tata group of companies , and in a sense the whole of corporate India , making it imperative for Tata Sons to disclose more than it has , proxy advisory firms said . In replacing Cyrus Mistry , the Tata Sons board has asserted its rights and exercised its privilege of appointing and sacking its CEO , but the board has failed to recognise their need to communicate . This absence of clear communication has prompted excessive speculation , they said . <p> " The Tata group , given its stature and its century-old presence , is responsible and accountable to a much wider set of stakeholders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and begins to proactively communicate , " Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Limited ( IiAS ) has said . " The abruptness of developments at the Tata group has left stakeholders bewildered . " <p> Raising three issues , IiAS said , " the first is the legality of the process , the second the decision itself , and finally , what happens now that Cyrus Mistry has been ousted ? For investors , while the third is more fundamental , for the group the first two also matter . " <p> J N Gupta , managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services ( SES ) , said that governance issues raised by Mistry if true , will not only impact the shareholders but will also hit the Tata brand . He said Mistry 's letter has raised important questions on the independence of the independent directors and their conduct on all the boards of Tata firms . " Sebi may have to examine the allegations of insider trading in his ( Cyrus Mistry 's ) letter . Governance at present is lip service be it in India or the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation . And independence is a character that the law can not infuse . Law can only infuse fear , " said Gupta . <p> Tata Sons has stated that " the tenure of the former Chairman was marked by repeated departures from the culture and ethos of the group . " But , it is not enough to say that there were departures . Tata Sons needs to explain what these transgressions were and what are their implications , especially for the listed companies , IiAS said . <p> How will the dual power structure work , going forward ? Independent of whether the Tata Sons ' Articles of Association ( AoA ) " were modified , changing the rules of engagement between the Trusts , the Board of Tata Sons , the Chairman , and the operating companies , " with Ratan Tata remaining Chairperson of the Tata Trusts and Cyrus Mistry chairing Tata Sons , there was a dual power structure . Such duality blurs the lines of accountability and creates confusion in the rank and file . Going forward , the group needs to communicate how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leading the trusts and Tata Sons ) . <p> The group must put in places well-articulated roles , responsibilities , and rights , for the structure to work seamlessly . The Tata group must recognize its engagement rules have now changed In making an almost cursory statement that the Chairperson of Tata Sons has been ' replaced ' , and a generic response to Cyrus Mistry 's email leak , the Tata group is taking an extremely narrow and legal view of Tata Sons -- as an unlisted company -- with only a limited set of shareholders needing to know . But , developments including the leaked Cyrus Mistry letter , may have put events beyond their control . How the group flies through this turbulence , will determine the way the group is perceived and its terms of engagement with its stakeholders , IiAS said . <p> Another issue raised by the proxy firms is performance metrics for the Chairperson of Tata Sons . One of the reasons cited for Cyrus Mistry 's departure was non-performance . However , shareholders remain unclear on what were the performance metrics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cyrus Mistry 's attempts at reducing debt and getting rid of bleeding parts of the business appear to be rather obvious and practical decisions , given the debt overhang . This is reflected in the increased market capitalization . " If this strategic re-orientation is not acceptable to the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons , then the Tata 's must clearly articulate the deliverables of the Chairperson and the timelines within which the goals are to be achieved . This will not only help Cyrus Mistry 's successor , and prevent incidents of sudden departure in the future , but also provide guidance for investors in the listed Tata group companies , " IiAS said . <p> Will Cyrus Mistry continue as Chairman of Tata companies ? <p> The Chairman of Tata Sons is the de facto Chairman of the major listed Tata group companies . The Tata group needs to articulate if Cyrus Mistry will continue as Chairperson of Tata Motors , Tata Steel , Indian Hotels , TCS and other Tata companies , and if not , the market will have to be explained how these transitions will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet separately to initiate the process of removing Mistry . This will be a time-consuming process . How will Tata Sons tackle this issue remains a question mark .
