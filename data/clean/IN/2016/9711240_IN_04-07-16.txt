the jaish-e-muhammad is soliciting funds from congregated karachi mosques to send jihadists to fight in india and afghanistan , footage obtained by the indian express reveals .  the footage , shot on friday night and saturday -- counted by believers as the most sacred of the holy month of ramzan -- shows the jaish 's fund collectors operating with impunity , even though the organisation is officially proscribed in pakistan .  " help the mujahideen of the jaish-e-muhammad , the mujahideen of islam , fight jihad in kashmir against india , and in afghanistan against the americans , " one man can be heard saying in footage shot friday night , outside a mosque in karachi 's jacob lines area .  described as the " fountainhead of jihad " , the seminary is famous for having produced several top jihadist leaders , including jaish chief maulana masood azhar , qari saifullah akhtar , who headed the **25;227;toolong , and fazl-ur-rehman khalil , the leader of harkat-ul-mujahideen .  the jamia uloom-e-islam seminary was also alma mater to sami-ul-haq , the uttar pradesh-born head of indian intelligence believes to be operating out of karachi . sami-ul-haq , who uses the pseudonym asim umar , was designated a terrorist by the united states last week .  in an eid message posted online on friday , the aqis chief called on indian muslims to " pick up their daggers , and start attacking the indian administrative service and indian police service officers who protect hindus during communal riots " .  " when your daggers reach the necks of the hindus who now call for your blood , you see how their words change , " he said .  even though jaish-e-muhammad was banned by pakistan in 2002 , following its attack on parliament house in new delhi , it continues to operate military facilities in several parts of pakistan . earlier this year , this newspaper had obtained satellite images showing that the terrorist group had set up new military facilities in the shadows of the historic maujgarh fort , in pakistan 's cholistan desert .  following january 's attack on the indian air force base in pathankot , pakistan prime minister 's foreign one of the attackers had been traced to the jaish 's headquarters in bahawalpur .  however , the findings of a team of pakistani investigators who visited pathankot are yet to be shared with new delhi , and islamabad has yet to accept that terrorists killed during the attack were its citizens .  masood azhar , who aziz had said was being held in " protective custody " , has continued to write in jaish 's in-house magazine , rang-o-noor .  in recent months , indian security sources say , the jaish-e-muhammad 's operations have seen a significant uptick in kashmir , with the group seeking to expand the strength of its cadre in the hills around srinagar , as well as in northern kashmir .
