' pava ' stands for pelargonic acid vanillylamide , also called nonivamide , and is an organic compound found in natural chilli pepper .  on the scoville scale ( to measure the power of chilli ) , pava is categorised as " above peak " , meaning it will " severely irritate and paralyse " humans , but the irritation and paralysis will remain " temporary " in nature . it is also used as a food additive to add pungency , flavouring and the spicy effect to eatables.
