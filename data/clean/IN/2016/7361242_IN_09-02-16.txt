<p> As a result , it seems like everyone who 's anyone wants to be seen at Finovate . Pretty much every imaginable bank is here to scope out the competition and keep their finger on the pulse - Dutch bank ABN Amro alone has sent 11 people - and I 've spotted attendees as esoteric as representatives from both the Government of Ontario and Kenya . <p> The conference has been running around the world since 2007 and this week 's event in London is the second biggest , just pipped by last September 's conference in New York . Everyone I 've spoken to is surprised at just how busy it is . <p> Clearly , fintech is not just hot - it 's steaming . But is the market overheating ? <p> A venture capitalist bumped into shortly after arriving mentioned without prompting that they were keen to see how " frothy " the market is right now . Less than half an hour later I overheard an employee of a European banking software company saying : " Anyone with a bright idea is starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems like there 's a creeping feeling that every man and his dog is piling into the fintech market right now , chasing the bountiful cash flooding into the sector . But just how viable or sustainable many of the businesses popping up remains to be seen . <p> Meniga was founded back in 2008 and so has seen the hype around fintech build . Ludviksson is bullish on fintech , believing there are plenty of startups out there that will change the market . But even he admits : " There 's a lot of investment but I do n't know how much of it will come to something . " <p> A senior banker at a US investment bank who has worked on several private fintech investment deals over the last year told me at the conference that there 's a growing skepticism among investors . <p> He 's seeing increasing value adjustment in the market as investors do stricter due diligence and reassess how much fintech companies are really worth . Revenues and market share are becoming a lot more important than just smart ideas and potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services at Silicon Valley Bank , says that there 's actually less froth in fintech that there have been in many other tech markets in the past , such as e-commerce for example . <p> " The hurdles of getting into growth stage in fintech are higher because there are regulatory and compliance hurdles , " says McCracken . " It 's pretty obvious to spot the people who do know them , from those that do n't . It is easier to screen a team compared to any other digital area . " <p> Still , the funding tap that many aspiring fintech entrepreneurs are looking to drink from could be about to dry up . <p> McCracken says 2016 is a year of " sorting the wheat from the chaff " for tech investors , saying : " We just drew up some thoughts about what 2016 looks like for the tech market . There 's been a lot of early stage investing . But what saw in Q4 in California was seed and early stage investing halved in number compared to 12 months previous . But the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VCs are doing relatively fewer deals but supporting the ones they want to do quite well . <p> " This is doubly so in fintech because , although there was a lot of froth in terms of funding in lots of particular subsets , what 's become clear now is who are the one or two leaders in a particular subsector . It 's easy for the VCs to keep supporting those companies rather than finding ' new new ' . " <p> That means we 're likely to see a lot more follow-on rounds for more established companies such as TransferWise , Funding Circle , and Crowdcube . <h> TIMES GLOBAL PARTNERS <p> Times Global Partners is an initiative focused on partnering with Established and Emerging Global Digital Companies for growing their presence and business in India through growth in their Brand , audience , adoption , distribution and monetization.
