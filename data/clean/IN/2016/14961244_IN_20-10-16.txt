" it is not easy to become a ms. chef . from over 60 entries , we narrowed it down to 20 after several rounds of interviews , food and kitchen audits by food consultants . many women got rejected because of untidy kitchens , " explains sashikala sathiyamurthy , who runs an interior designing firm .  all the kitchens and chefs that come under ms. chef are approved by the quality standards set by fssai .  a clean kitchen is a prerequisite to become a ms.chef ,  the 20 chefs on the app make around five dishes each and update it on the app . the customers ' orders on the app directly reaches the chef 's kitchen . the tasya team helps with home delivery .  tasya curates and guides the chefs on the menu , taste , hygiene and food safety . the women whip up a variety from hyderabadi chicken biriyani , and kerala fish curry , to italian and mexican specialities . shifa arshad , a paediatric and preventive dentist says , " one of our chefs specialises in organic meals and the concept of food as medicine . then there are those who make amazing snacks . each chef decides on how many dishes she wants to make in a day . if she has time only to make a biriyani , she says so on the app . this helps the customers place orders accordingly , " explains shifa .  with deepavali around the corner , the app can be used to order traditional sweets , such as ellu urundai , saththu maavu urundai , and other sweets , older chefs making sweets the way our grandmothers did . as their children and grand children are settled abroad this gives them an opportunity to revisit traditions and they are happy with it , " says shifa . tara prasath who also has an interior designing firm adds that there are plans to include healthy nutritious meals for school going children through ms.chef . " working couples can place orders for lunch for their children and we will deliver , " she says .  another member of tasya , wedding planner reshma srijay says , " our objective is to have a meaningful dialogue with homemakers . " we are lucky we have the support of our families in our business , but there are many out there who are not . we want to reach out to them . "  the financial independence makes the women confident and artist madhu kannan gives her own example . " i was a homemaker for 18 years . when i got an opportunity to get back to work , it was liberating . i earned the respect of my family members many other women . "  the recently launched app has crossed over 500 downloads and devika says the plan is to take it pan india . " any start up works when you have focus , and invest time and energy into it . we want to tell the home makers to empower themselves with this opportunity . we urge them to take charge and work independently . men should involve women in financial decisions of the family . i never wanted to step out . my husband insisted i learn everything . because of that , when i lost him three years ago , i was able to manage , " says devika .  while sashikala and shifa recount how the journey exposed them to a variety of cuisines , rachel premnath , ceo of an it company , says they ensure junk food is out .
