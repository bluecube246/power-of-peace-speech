<p> The Reds kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League this season as a result in a game when chances were few and far between , and it 's something that everyone associated with the club will hope continues . <p> Clyne told the official Liverpool website : " We 've settled really well at the back and we 're trying our best to keep up good performances like United , when we were more solid and did n't give them many chances . If you can get a clean sheet , it gives you a chance of winning the game . " <p> The right-back , who has been impressive since his arrival from Southampton in the summer of 2015 , said that the new signings at the back in Joel Matip and Ragnar Klavan had settled in well , while everyone was contributing when they were called upon . <p> Matip has been the player that has stood out from the defenders since his arrival , and seems to have impressed Clyne too , who added : " He 's settled in like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's built a good partnership and has done really well defensively . <p> " He 's confident on the ball , you see him driving forward from defence and helping to set up attacks . He 's good and I like playing with him . <p> " He is not fazed by anything . He is putting in good performances and long may they continue . " <p> Liverpool 's Joel Matip in action <p> Matip certainly seems to be impressing many people , and the partnership with Dejan Lovren looks potentially as solid a partnership as the Reds have had at the heart of the defence for several years . <p> His presence at the back along with his calmness on the ball are both huge plus points that Liverpool seem to be benefiting from . <p> Set-pieces are still something of a problem for the defensive unit as a whole but their defending in open play does n't seem to have a lot wrong with it . They will be hoping to build on their recent clean sheet , and hope it 's the start of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolland <p> A journalism graduate of Liverpool John Moores University .
