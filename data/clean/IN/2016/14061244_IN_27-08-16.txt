<h> Sunday Interview : ' Poor women are exploited in the name of surrogacy ... It must end ' <p> The poor and vulnerable women are being exploited in the name of surrogacy and paid a very small amount for renting out their wombs . <p> Dr Soumya Swaminathan <p> The Surrogacy ( Regulation ) Bill 2016 , cleared by the Union Cabinet , has been criticised by doctors and gay rights activists as " anti-liberal " . DR Soumya Swaminathan , director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research , who had an important role in drafting the bill , in a candid talk with Teena Thacker justifies the new legislation citing how it will end exploitation of poor and vulnerable , and will actually help needy infertile Indian couples . <p> Why did the government decide to take up the issue of surrogacy , leaving behind all other assisted reproductive technologies , given the fact that the proposed Assisted Reproduc-tive Technology Bill was in making since 2008 ? <p> There were many parliamentary assurances and a PIL in the Supreme Court was also filed , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate this growing and booming industry . Now that the first stage has passed , we will soon put our minds on bringing a legislation to regulate other forms of ART , like IVF , sperm banks , embryo transfers , etc . <p> Since the surrogacy bill talks only about altruistic surrogacy , how would you define " close relatives " ? There is still a long process to go before the bill is finally passed by Parliament . There will be rules and the definition of " close relatives " that will be defined in the rules , will be framed soon . <p> Do n't you think that the law explicitly discriminates homosexuals ? <p> No , this is a side issue . There is a very small proportion of people needing surrogacy . Gay people have an option of adoption . So it 's not that all the doors are closed for them . <p> When a single man can adopt a child then why he is not allowed to go for surrogacy ? Do n't you think that both adoption rules and surrogacy bill contradict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man can only adopt a male child . However , in surrogacy it is not possible , as one can not predict in surrogacy whether the child will be a girl or a boy . <p> In many families , when a child is born out of surrogacy , not even immediate blood relatives of the couple get to know due to social ostracisation . How-ever , the proposed bill will make the identity of the surrogate mother open not only to the family , but to others as well . Do n't you think it 's giving too much information to everyone , and puts one 's privacy at stake ? <p> It is happening in India and many other countries where a close relative is a surrogate mother . There have not been any documented problems , so I do n't think it will affect relationships or privacy of any individual or a couple . <p> How did you come to the conclusion that the couple had to be married for five years before approaching for surrogacy ? Five years is a reasonable time for any couple to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to give time to a couple so that surrogacy can be used as a last option and five years is a pretty good time . <p> Do n't you think that altruistic surrogacy only through close relatives will lead to a complex situation later in life of both , the surrogate mother and the child born out of surrogacy ? <p> This has been a cultural practice in India for a long time -- family members giving birth to babies and handing over to infertile relatives . So far , there have been no problems documented from either side . Therefore , predicting or assuming such problems is too farfetched . <p> The draft bill also talks of establishing a National Surrogacy Board and state surrogacy boards and will designate authorities at the district level to review the eligibility of couples inten-ding to engage surrogates . How will it work ? <p> There will be rules that will be framed soon . The National Surrogacy Board will work under the chairmanship of the Union health minister and the state boards will have a DG level officer , a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The surrogacy clinics will have to be registered under these boards at both levels . <p> Infertility groups have criticised the proposed law saying it could lead to an illegal industry . Your comment . <p> Laws will need to be implemented properly , like any other rules or regulations in the country . Proper implementation of law is important to safeguard such apprehensions . <p> Various IVF experts have also been saying that the bill would end up denying millions of Indian women the opportunity to take advantage of advancements in medical science . What do you think ? <p> There are other reproductive technologies available and have not been banned yet . <p> For some women , surrogacy is a means to earn livelihood . When you decided to ban commercial surrogacy , did you take into consideration this aspect and such women ? Do n't you think it 's unfair as poor women were able to earn a good amount of money ? <p> There was an issue of exploitation of surrogate mother and the issue of abandonment of the child was another major concern . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surrogacy and paid a very small amount for renting out their wombs . A majority of these women do n't understand the legal documents being drawn up for their services . The new bill , once enacted , will abolish that practice . In any case , selling your body should not be a livelihood option and the new legislation will tighten the noose . <p> Whether a couple wants to go for surrogacy , first child , second child , disabled child , are individual decisions . Do n't you think restricting it seems like too much of dictating ? <p> Surrogacy is generally used as a last option . Through this legislation , the government is only trying to restrict surrogacy and not let it be an easy method for people who have other options .
