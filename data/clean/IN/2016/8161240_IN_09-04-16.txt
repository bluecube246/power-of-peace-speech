<h> The hindi dubbed version of ' The Jungle Book ' is a capsule of nostalgia for the 90 's kids <p> The era of 90 's is considered golden for many reasons , but for the Gen Y , 90 's will always remain the decade of Mowgli , at least for us Indians . Yes , that yellow fur wearing , human who lived in the jungle with his awesome friends Bagheera , Baloo ( Bhalu ) , Pappu and scary enemy Shere Khan . The week long wait for half an hour episode meant everything to a 3 year old me . <p> Jon Favreau , the director of the recently released live-action ' The Jungle Book ' , would 've never thought what territory he 's venturing into and what the story meant for all 80 's and 90 's kids in India ! <p> The Hindi version of ' The Jungle Book ' brings everything back on a bigger scale . <p> With popular Hollywood actors giving their voiceovers and a popular , successful director on board , ' The Jungle Book ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney India 's decision to include famous Bollywood names for the Hindi dubbed version made it a huge release in the home market as well ! <p> The authenticity might be in the English version but the Hindi dubbed version is and will remain closer to our hearts for reasons listed below : <p> The language connect <p> Let 's face it , most of us watched the Hindi dubbed version before the original Disney movie . Thus , Mowgli always seemed ' one of us ' . A desi boy living with his friends , using pure Hindi and urdu words . Even the names of the animals were our popular nicknames ! It was one foreign originated series which was based in an Indian set up . Hence it was more relatable . <p> Trip to nostalgia land <p> One can feel the excitement the moment ' Chaddhi Pehen Ke ' plays on TV or radio these days . It brings back a flood of memories and take us back to those lovely Sunday afternoon when homework used to be naming the animals or writing 5 colors . TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandad on one full trolley immediately come into our minds . ' The Jungle Book ' brings all that back and this time in 3D , for real ! <p> Familiar settings and recall factor <p> Yes , ' Water Truce ' is good but ' Jal Shanti Sandhi ' sounds like our very own Doordarshan ! Rudyard Kipling wrote his book after getting inspired from an Indian jungle . The name of every character is Indian . There is Indian-ness all over ' The Jungle Book ' . Jon Favreau kept the originality intact by choosing an Indian for the part of Mowgli . All this combined with the voices of Om Puri , Shefali Shah , Nana Patekar and Priyanka Chopra , gives us the much loved old wine in an even more wonderful new bottle ! <p> Our childhood legacy <p> For many people , including myself , ' Mowgli ' is probably the first TV show memory alongside Shaktimaan . Now is the time to show your legacy to the new generation of kids . The smart phone kids deserve to know all the hysteria around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to watch the ' tacky ' Hindi version , but ' Mowgli ' was , is and will remain the first friend , Gen Y is so proud of ! <p> The Hindi version of ' The Jungle Book ' brings everything back on a bigger scale . The happiness we felt with our friend ' Mowgli ' , the desperation we experienced when an episode was missed , the first song we learnt and recognised and the book our school teachers read to us often ! <p> Thank you Jon Favreau and Disney India for bringing our childhood back . You have no idea what scale of happiness you 've brought in our lives !
