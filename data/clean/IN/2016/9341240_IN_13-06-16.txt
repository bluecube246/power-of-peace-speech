<h> Nana Patekar fumes on the sets of Tadka <p> Nana Patekar is known as much for his sharp acting as his temper troubles . The senior actor of late has been particularly miffed on the sets of his romantic comedy film Tadka , directed by Prakash Raj . The film stars Ali Fazal , Taapsee Pannu and Shriya Saran apart from Nana and is extensively shot in Goa . <p> Says a source from the sets , " Nana comes to the set with his own to-do list and does n't get along well with the director . Just a few weeks ago , he walked out of the set because he was upset with the production team 's mismanagement . " <p> We repeatedly tried to get in touch with the actor and his son Malhar Patekar , but to no avail .
