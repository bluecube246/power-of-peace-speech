he was then a caretaker prime legacy of nehru is a significant departure from the traditional foreign policy approach of new delhi . indian policymakers ' fixation with non-alignment has remained a central component of indian identity in global politics that is manifest in continuities : since independence in 1947 , india has been in pursuit of strategic autonomy , a quest that in practice has led to semi-alliances fashioned under the cover of non-alignment and shaped by regional dynamics . in this setting , the rise of china now raises an interesting conundrum for indian policymakers as new delhi seeks to balance the benefits and risks of an increasingly assertive neighbour and a network of alliances with like-minded countries .  the decision to adopt non-alignment was not merely an idealistic dream of neutrality , but was , rather , based on a realistic assessment of india 's geopolitical situation . nehru intended to give india room to manoeuvre according to its own interests rather than allowing it to become confined within the limitations of a cold war alliance . hindsight reveals the consequences of this approach . although providing the benefits of flexibility , non-alignment credence only to pakistan as a threat .  finding an effective grand strategy inevitably requires a balancing act . non-alignment has been india 's answer to this challenge and an influential tenet of its foreign and security policy since its emergence from colonization . this approach has in the past enabled india to avoid many of the limitations and entanglements of formal alliances ; but it has also left the country in the position of shaping policy in a reactive manner .  india is now at a crossroads . china 's rise and assertiveness as a regional and global power and the simultaneous rise of middle powers in the region mean that this balancing act is increasing in both complexity and importance , simultaneously . china 's growth presents great opportunities for positive engagement , but territorial disputes and a forward policy in the region raise concerns for new delhi , particularly in the indian ocean and with pakistan . the region itself is riddled with rivalries ; a desire to balance china may push states together , while other issues divide them . the same applies on the in sino-us relations .  indian policymakers have continued to place emphasis on strategic autonomy , a relic of non-alignment , as a means of mitigating the potential costs of a strategic partnership with the us . this balancing act is evident in relations with china : despite interest in cooperation with the us , india stands to benefit from an economic partnership with china and wishes to avoid antagonizing its more powerful neighbour by serving as the lynchpin of the us pivot to asia , which the chinese broadly perceive as a measure of containment . there is also lingering concern over us reliability , not only owing to its relationship with pakistan but also because of its vulnerability to china during the financial crisis of 2008 -- 09 . likewise , india has balanced its still strong defence relationship with russia against its interests in cooperation with the us . new delhi has sided with russia , china and iran in avoiding interference in syria 's civil war and , despite voicing concern over the spread of the islamic state network , has continued to promote a syrian-led process in india that the country 's capabilities in the event of a conflict with pakistan may be limited by over-reliance on the us , which continues to extend defence aid to pakistan despite a drop after 2011 .  despite this hesitancy , india is facing a major shift in power dynamics with the rise of china that adds impetus to its pursuit of constructive relations with the us and america 's asian allies . india stands to benefit from being more assertive . already , cooperation with regional players is boosting its economy and defence capabilities , and as a pillar of the us pivot to asia , india is finding support for an increased role as a regional power-broker . these growing partnerships do not need to bar engagement with china . moreover , assertiveness in regional and global relations may actually carve out more room for india to pursue the strategic autonomy it values .  india 's rising global profile is reshaping new delhi 's approach to its major partnerships in the changing global order . though sections of the indian establishment still want to reinvent non-alignment of pursuing strategic autonomy separately from non-alignment under modi . this separation is overdue in india 's foreign policy , and the country stands to benefit from leveraging partnerships rather than shunning them . under the modi government , india is charting new territory in its foreign policy , predicated on the belief that , rather than proclaiming non-alignment as an end in itself , india needs deeper engagement with its friends and partners if it is to develop leverage in its dealings with its adversaries and competitors . india is today well positioned to define its bilateral relationships on its own terms without ideological crutches .  harsh v. pant is professor at king 's college , london , and head of strategic studies at the observer research foundation , new delhi .
