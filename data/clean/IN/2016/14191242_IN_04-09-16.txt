Climate of Hostility

<h> Climate of Hostility <p> It is a known fact of international politics that political contestations and divergent economic interests have morphed into military conflicts , if the general atmosphere of inter state interaction is based on hostility . In our world that is still largely based on inter-state interactions , and the final agency is a sovereign-territorial state , it is the responsibility of state leaders , and of the institutions of a state , that the inter-state interaction is guarded from any hostile atmosphere . It was for this purpose that transnational institutions were framed to make the interstate interaction qualitatively different . If earlier it was solely guided by the considerations of self-help , and a response to the anarchic nature of international politics , now the element of complex interdependence became a game changer . It was this change that brought peace to regions we know as developed zones of the world . But unfortunately our part of the world could not be a part of that changed atmosphere . For decades South Asia , with India and Pakistan its major states , remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Kashmir also bore its brunt . After the cold war was over and the global politics dictated by bipolarity changed for good , the region could have laid the path for a peaceful cooperation . But it did not happen , and the reason for this is again the Indo-Pak hostility . And now we are again seeing the region sliding into a worst kind of international power contest . The rise of China as an economic power , and an alliance of Russia and China on many international matters , like Syria , has resulted into a strenuous US-China competition , that can anytime slip into any form of active hostility . Unfortunately India and Pakistan are taking opposite routes in this contestation . Once again the reason that the two countries fit each other in an enemy frame is Kashmir . What does it mean to the people of this region except a looming threat of violence . In this scenario the two countries , India and Pakistan , must talk out the difference and make a forward movement on Kashmir possible . This time when an All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of Kashmir is looked through the prism of responsible sovereignly and not a jingoistic nationalism .
