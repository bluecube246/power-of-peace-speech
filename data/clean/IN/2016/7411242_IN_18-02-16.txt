<h> EPOS in Limbo , PDS Diversion Goes Unchecked <p> HYDERABAD : The diversion of rice and other essential commodities distributed through fair price shops ( FPS ) continues unabated in TS , especially Greater Hyderabad , and authorities have seized commodities worth Rs 11.5 lakh in the last three months . <p> In separate operations , vigilance &amp; enforcement , police and civil supplies officials seized these public distribution system ( PDS ) commodities and slapped 61 cases , 25 of which are criminal . <p> Officials of the civil supplies department believe that implementation of Electronic Point of Sale ( EPOS ) could have put a check on the diversion of essential commodities . EPOS is a system put in use on a pilot basis at 18 FPS in the last two years and was extremely successful . It utilises bio-metric identity of beneficiary whose Food Security Card is linked with Aadhaar card . " Only genuine beneficiary or his family members can avail the ration benefits . If the dealer tries to divert anything , it would show online , " said an official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departmental order issued on Nov 13 , 2015 directed the department against the implementation of EPOS . " The earlier order had put a stay on operationalising distribution of goods through EPOS . We are waiting for orders from the government to implement EPOS , " said another official on the condition of anonymity . According to him , the department had distributed EPOS machines to 1,545 FPS operating under GHMC limits . Training too had been imparted to FPS dealers as well as officials concerned . <p> As per the National Food Security Act ( NFSA ) , implementation of EPOS will also ensure that the dealers of PDS will get a commission of Rs 75 per quintal instead of the present Rs 25 per quintal . There are 859 FPS in the 9 circles of GHMC which fall under the jurisdiction of Hyderabad chief rationing officer . Similarly , there are 686 FPS in 3 circles which are part of Rangareddy district but fall under the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad chief rationing officer . <p> The distribution of cards per FPS is such that 9 circles have 8.23 lakh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making dealers in city outskirts overloaded with number of beneficiaries . <p> " Some of the FPS deal with only 600 card-holders whereas some others have up to 3,000 cards . We are also hoping to start rationalisation of FPS by distributing between 900 and 1,200 card-holders for each shop for their own economic viability . Main reason for possible diversion of essential commodities is non-viability of running an FPS , " a senior official pointed out . <p> At the current rate of commission , a dealer who distributes commodities to 900 card holders sell 150 quintals of rice , 9 quintals of wheat , 4.5 quintals of sugar , 9 quintals of pulses and 3000 litres of kerosene , earning himself a revenue of Rs 15 to Rs 17,000 per month . <p> Of the same , he pays up to Rs 7,000 and Rs 5,000 towards shop rent and salary of staff respectively , earning a net income of Rs 5,000 a month . <p> Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views !
