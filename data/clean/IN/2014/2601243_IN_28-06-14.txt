<h> Greece have developed a reputation over the years of being extremely hard to break down , particularly if they take the lead . Costa Rica , therefore , have their task cut out for the last 16 clash . <p> Recife , Brazil : Costa Rica are determined to score first when they tackle Greece in the World Cup last 16 in Recife on Sunday . ( Fixtures ) <p> Greece have developed a reputation over the years of being extremely hard to break down , particularly if they take the lead . <p> They have almost perfected the classic Italian system of catenaccio ( bolt-lock ) in which teams would play in an ultra defensive way and hope to score a single goal on the counter-attack to take a lead they would then defend . <p> And Los Ticos technical assistant Luis Marin said his team need to score early to prevent Greece from taking the lead and then shutting up shop . <p> " It 's crucial for us to score early in the game , especially as Greece are known to tighten up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But we know it 's going to be a tough game all round . Although they lost to Colombia ( 3-0 ) , the goals they conceded were down to simple mistakes . Greece are also potent on the counter-attack . " <p> He added : " Penalties could play a role at some point . They are a part of the game and although we hope it does n't happen , we have to prepare for every scenario . <p> " We 've been practising shooting from the penalty spot . " <p> Costa Rica emerged as one of the form teams of the group stages , stunning Uruguay and then Italy before drawing with England to finish top of Group D. <p> Greece only just squeezed into the knockout round by the skin of their teeth , Giorgios Samaras converting a late penalty to hand Fernando Santos 's men a decisive 2-1 win over Ivory Coast to book their first ever last 16 appearance . It was only Greece 's second goal in three matches . <p> Having steered Greece to their first ever appearance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force to be reckoned with . <p> " We have to pay a lot of attention to this game , they came out top in the ' Group of Death ' . As a result we ca n't afford to underestimate them , " said the Portuguese . <p> As well as their potent attack , Costa Rica can boast a tight defence -- having conceded just once , to an Edinson Cavani penalty during their 3-1 defeat of Uruguay , in the tournament so far . <p> " If we have a good point , it 's our defensive system , which is n't just the four or five defenders , " said coach Jorge Luis Pinto . <p> " Our defence is balanced , tough and very efficient . " <p> Given the flair with which Costa Rica sailed through Group D , they should start as favourites at the Arena Pernambuco -- where they stunned a lifeless Italy 1-0 last week . <p> But if Greece progress , the country 's federation bosses will need to look for a quick-fix solution to keep Santos on board for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the day after the last 16 clash , and the trained electrical engineer has no intention of having it renewed come what may .
