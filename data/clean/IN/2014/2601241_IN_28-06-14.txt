Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the bowler most likely to lead India 's bowling attack in England .  Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the bowler most likely to lead India 's bowling attack at the start of their five-match Test series against England . His abilities to swing the ball will be of utmost importance on friendly surfaces . But his returns were n't good in India 's tour match against Leicestershire . Shrikant Shankar believes if India are to achieve positive results in England , then Bhuvneshwar has to be in top form .  As India 's tour match against Leicestershire ended , one fact came out glaringly . India 's bowlers are not top class when it comes to Test cricket . Sure it was only a tour match , but these thoughts have been in the minds of the ones following the game for a while . It has been long since India won a Test series away from home . In fact , it has been almost an equal time before India won a Test away from home . Bowlers are supposed to win Test not seem like doing so .  Sri Lanka beat England 1-0 in the recent Test series . But a stronger Indian team on paper still does not give the impression of pulling off a similar heist . India have selected seven seam/swing bowlers in their enormous squad for the tour of England . All the seven bowled in the tour match against Leicestershire . Only three wickets fell to those bowlers . Ishant Sharma got two wickets , but received a pasting from Angus Robson and Greg Smith . Another bowler who proved to be expensive was Bhuvneshwar Kumar . The swing bowler gave away 46 runs off seven overs at an economy-rate of 6.57 .  While one could make out that the pitch at Grace Road was more suited to the batsmen , there was still enough in it for the bowlers . Bhuvneshwar is India 's attack leader and the conditions in England , according to history , favour his type of swing bowling . Bhuvneshwar could not get his length right throughout his seven-over spell . He bowled far too full in search of swing and deliveries . Bhuvneshwar conceded 10 fours in those seven overs -- that is far too many for an international bowler .  The spinners bail the swing/seam bowlers out in Indian conditions on a regular basis . But overseas , especially in England , the faster bowlers must be the ones taking the wickets . Ishant had a very good Test series away against New Zealand , but one really does n't know what to expect from him after all these years . Mohammed Shami and Varun Aaron are relatively new to international cricket , but they offer some pace . Bhuvneshwar , though , does n't bowl that quickly . His 80 mph deliveries are not going to trouble many batsmen , even if he does swing the ball .  Bhuvneshwar has to find the right lengths and surprise the batsmen with his ability to swing the ball both ways without much change in his bowling action . England lost the Test series against Sri Lanka , but many of their batsmen got in amongst the runs with some centuries . India are well capable of letting the likes , to score the big runs again . Bhuvneshwar has proved to be less useful when the ball becomes old , so , it is imperative for him to take the wickets upfront .  His form in Test cricket too has not been great . He did n't play a single Test match against South Africa and New Zealand away in the past one year . While one does not expect him to run through batting line-ups although that would be welcomed , Bhuvneshwar needs to do his bit by taking wickets at the top . If Bhuvneshwar is in form during the five-Test series against England , then India have a better chance of getting some positive results in the much-awaited Test series .
