" i love that top , but the neckline makes my face so long . these palazzos are so comfortable , but they make me look short and stout ... aargh ! " how often have you walked into a shop , tried on clothes , and thought , " if i could just change this one thing about the outfit , it would look perfect " ? similar experiences led 24-year-old jennifer mehta to start je couturier , to offer women clothes customised based on their taste and comfort . " i was always extremely thin and found it difficult to get the right fit . the few that fit were expensive . so i 'd cut off sleeves or tweak clothes to suit my body . eventually , my parents bought me a sewing machine and by the time i was 18 , i was making outfits for myself . friends started asking me to design for them too and in one year i made 20 outfits for others . " despite this she pursued a career as a marketing professional , until a year style of ready-made shirts , i also designed my own office-wear : shirts , skirts , blouses , dresses ... they reflected my personality , so i could carry them off with confidence . when clients noticed my clothes and asked me to design for them , i realised this is what i want to do and studied designing from modart in mumbai . " but mumbai has no dearth of good seamstresses , tailors and designers . so what makes je couturier different ? " while many customise indian clothes well , none do it minutely for western wear , especially in the daily-wear segment . and definitely not at our rates . besides giving customers fashionable outfits , i try to understand who they are and what they want . i explain the colours that suit their skin tone , necklines that match their facial structure and sleeves that suit their arms . i plan designs that give their bodies a balanced look . " although jennifer displays samples at her little shop in bandra , none are for sale . she takes each client through a detailed session concept , she models for her own designs and prices her apparels ( all kinds of western- wear ) reasonably . for instance , gowns cost ' 10,000-15,000 ' and tops ' 1,500-2,500 ' . given a budget , she also creates an entire office range for some clients . " office wear has to suit the client 's profession , but also has to be trendy and impressive . i use colours , styling and combine image consulting tools with design to give clients height , a powerful presence or anything else they require . " she does n't sell indian wear , but for her bridal package , she conceptualises the outfits and gets them made with her specifications . " i create a complete look , advising on jewellery , shoes and make-up too . the minimum budget of 50,000 , covers all the outfits and my fees . "  jennifer 's tips : ideal necklines to match your face  round face halter , cowl , narrow-long v and square necks work better for a round face , as they give it more structure , making oval face an oval face has a better balanced structure , so there 's no harm in highlighting the face . crew , boat , key-hole and turtle necks work best for oval faces and the off-shoulder style too .  heart-shaped face while crew , balanced v , boat and sweet-heart necks are the most suitable , persons with a heartshaped face can carry off almost any neckline without a problem .  square face you want necklines that will soften the more-defined facial features of persons with a square face ; turtle , balanced round and cowl necks do this by lending a feminine touch .  triangle face for the sharp jawline of a triangle face , you need a halter , scoop or sweetheart neck .  diamond face while the oval face looks best on a model 's figure , the diamond shaped face is the ideal for an average person . it 's best to opt for halter , crew , scoop and sweetheart necks .  while it is important to consider the structure of the face when choosing the neckline , the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
