Airlines in fare war again : SpiceJet , IndiGo roll out discounts for the peak travel season  MUMBAI : SpiceJet on Friday cut ticket prices for the peak travel season , from September till December , to induce travellers to book tickets in advance .  The offer included the eye-catching figure of Rs 1,999 for a trip between Delhi and Goa though tickets would have to be bought before 30 June . IndiGo responded with a similar offer .  " A popular route like Delhi-Goa is on offer at Rs 1,999 ( one way ) while the spot-fare for the same route is Rs 11,253 . These offers will not only help travellers to plan their Puja holidays but also post-October breaks , " said Rajesh Magow , co-founder and India CEO of Makemytrip .  " With fare-validity window falling in the winter holiday season , we expect travellers will use this opportunity to upgrade the transport-leg of their holiday to flight instead of rail or other land transport options , " he added .  For both airlines the low fare only ) . SpiceJet has been leading price wars throughout the year , forcing other low fare carriers to follow suit , often at the cost of their margins .  The Kalanithi Maran controlled airline in January slashed fares by 50% and later followed with a Rs1 fare ( excluding taxes ) . The DGCA cracked down on the latter offer calling it " predatory " pricing .  On June 10 , SpiceJet had announced a monsoon package but that offer was for those whose journeys originated from south Indian cities such as Bengaluru , Chennai and Coimbatore .  At the end of May , the Indian arm of Malaysian carrier AirAsia launched flights with all inclusive fares of Rs 990 . IndiGo followed with aRs1 base fare .  These fares could impact margins . SpiceJet posted record losses of Rs 1,003.24 crore in the year ended March 31 . Air India has quietly been following the fare cuts .  Jet , which has n't been as aggressive has steadily lost marketshare this year , declining from 19.9% in January to 17.1% in May . In April had occupancies of 76% . In June , SpiceJet load factors shot to 81% while Indigo 's was 82% .  However the period between October to December is the holiday period which sees a spurt in travel and loads for airlines . Cutting fares for that season shows airlines are expecting unutilised capacity .
