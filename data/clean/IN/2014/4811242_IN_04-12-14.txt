as the india international centre in new delhi holds a retrospective of ruth prawer jhabvala 's films , let 's look back at the life and times of the unassuming writer who made sense of a young , post colonial india , says anuj kumar  what can a writer do in a visual medium like cinema to make his/her presence felt ? disappear from the scene ? exactly , this is what ruth prawer jhabvala did . over and over again , she vanished from the scene even as we relished her nuanced study of cultures , particularly those on the verge of extinction captured through the perceptive lens of james ivory . together with producer ismail merchant , they became a three-headed deity , representing three cultures and continents , which merchant often used to call a three-headed monster in jest .  a year after she passed away in new york , as her family , friends and connoisseurs of her craft reflect on her contribution through a series of events this month , ruth is back in focus .  aruna chakravarti , empathy and exile : the novels of ruth prawer jhabvala " , says ruth smoothly straddled the worlds of literary and cinematic writing without any jarring notes . " she did n't indulge in any intellectual analysis of cultures . her works are inherently dialogue-based in nature . the issues come alive through human interactions . her mouthpieces were ordinary people . "  be it " the householder " , " heat and dust " , " a room with a view " or " the remains of the day " , ruth became the fly on the wall noting the interplay of class , identity and ethnicity . dislocation was a constant theme in her life and it reflected in her work . she was born in germany when being a jew was a curse . her family ran away to england , where she found a language to express herself and a parsi boy she could spend her life with .  married to eminent architect cyrus jhabvala , ruth spent the next two decades in india , and the country 's heat and dust effortlessly slipped into delights . like every westerner , chakravarti says , ruth went through three phases . " first she found everything good about india . the sun was warm , the air was mellow and the people were friendly . she was taken by the indian philosophy of live and let live . but gradually she discovered the economic and social disparity . the gurus who dupe westerners seeking peace found their way into her writing ( ' the guru ' ) and suddenly the warmth and mellowness became heat and dust . but gradually she came to terms with the truth that indian spirituality has a lot more to offer . one can sense it in ' heat and dust ' itself , when olivia wants her ashes to be sprinkled on the himalayas . "  she wrote about issues she herself grappled with . often her protagonists were a reflection of her , trying to fit into different cultures . salman rushdie called her a rootless intellectual , but chakravarti says her lack of a sense of belonging became her strength . her aspiration for assimilation spurred many a a refugee , always a refugee ' . " she was ruthlessly honest about it and many indian critics could not grasp her work in entirety , " holds chakravarti , adding she was no different when she was in new york . " there she was writing about beggars spending nights in the open and compared them with indian beggars , who she felt had something cheery about their disposition . she wrote about how taking care of old people was part of western culture . "  it reflected in the choices she made in adapting works of e.m . forster ( " a room with a view " , " howard 's end " ) , evan s. connell ( " mr. and mrs bridge " ) and kazio ishigurio ( " the remains of the day " ) . indeed there were no jarring notes as she made somebody else 's work hers .  was she born to write for cinema ? not quite . as a booker winner , she was supposed to revel in authorial ego . but she adapted literary works to the two academy awards . an unparalleled feat . what she once called just a hobby brought her fame , but she zealously guarded her privacy .  her eldest daughter renana , a social worker , who has been associated with sewa for a long time , describes her as a recluse who was constantly questioning herself . " she did n't even go to receive the academy awards . she preferred to watch the ceremony on television . " during her early years she was social but gradually became more observant . her husband 's partner was a punjabi and his gregarious family opened a window to the chaos and carnival that india was in the decades after independence . and the eminently perceptive ruth inhaled the complexities and breathed out simple everyday situations that entertained with their subtlety and nuances . " if you withdraw yourself from the conversation you can observe much more . she had an eagle eye , noticing the strengths and weakness of people around her . "  arranged marriage became a plot point in " the householder " where the mother-in-law was at was a social worker but as we know , mothers-in-law had a standard behaviour in india . she came into a family where there were four bahus . so there was enough material around her . but i am still curious where she found the householder . "  when she shifted to delhi , she first lived on pusa road and renana says the college in " the householder " is actually s. n. das gupta college , which she could see from the window of her room .  no wonder , the window has found its way to the invite renana is sending out to people who want to know more about ruth .  on her writing regimen , renana says , " our father used to leave for work early , and from 9 a.m. to noon nobody was allowed into her room .  this was the time when she used to write on her old typewriter ( a part of the exhibition ) with utmost discipline . once she was done with writing she would show the manuscript to our father but as far read them . she would only converse with james ivory through letters . and after noon she was like any other mother , fussing over our food , dresses and homework . "  her critics described her sensibility as ' antique shop ' , and when indian readers discovered her lineage they started seeing her work in a different light . renana calls it an " unfair criticism " , something that reflects a defensive nature towards one 's culture . she admits that ruth was upset but maintains that was not the reason for her shifting to new york . " she did feel that she did n't belong to the place in the cultural sense , but the point was that her collaborators were in new york and after she received the macarthur foundation fellowship she had the money to sustain a life in new york . but she did n't sever her links with india . she used to spend two months with us every year , " says renana .  putting things in perspective , chakravarti says , " ruth never put herself in the and anita desai . she maintained that if someone ever wanted to bracket her she belonged to the tradition of kipling and forster .
