Video : Phone bursts into flames in the hands of a girl in China  Share this :  We have been told a million times to be wary of the worn out batteries inside the mobile devices . A similar case was witnessed when a young-girl suffered burn injuries due to the bursting out of her phone . She was traveling in a bus when it all happened .  The CCTV footage showed that the passengers were frightened to the core and the girl ran up and down in the bus with hands of flame .  According to the onlookers , the girl somehow managed to get the phone away from her hand and the driver lets the terrified passengers out of the bus . This is a horrible incident and for a long time , something similar has not been reported .  The young girl did not suffer from any major injuries and there were only a few minor burns on her hand . The other passengers in the bus were left unhurt .  The moral of the story is that from reputed dealers . Some of the fake batteries tend to blast off due to extra load and other possible reasons .
