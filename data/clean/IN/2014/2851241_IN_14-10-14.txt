video : phone bursts into flames in the hands of a girl in china  share this :  we have been told a million times to be wary of the worn out batteries inside the mobile devices . a similar case was witnessed when a young-girl suffered burn injuries due to the bursting out of her phone . she was traveling in a bus when it all happened .  the cctv footage showed that the passengers were frightened to the core and the girl ran up and down in the bus with hands of flame .  according to the onlookers , the girl somehow managed to get the phone away from her hand and the driver lets the terrified passengers out of the bus . this is a horrible incident and for a long time , something similar has not been reported .  the young girl did not suffer from any major injuries and there were only a few minor burns on her hand . the other passengers in the bus were left unhurt .  the moral of the story is that from reputed dealers . some of the fake batteries tend to blast off due to extra load and other possible reasons .  watch the video footage of the incident below :  share this :  about david mayor  writer and editor of the next digit media , he takes care of ios , apple , mac and other gadgets . he worked at apple inc , before joining to tnd media . he was graduated in bachelor of journalism &amp; mass communication degree from cambridge university . all posts by david
