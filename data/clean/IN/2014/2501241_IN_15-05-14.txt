congress subtle acceptance of defeat ; moots mamata for pm  new delhi : contrary to congress vice-president rahul gandhi 's posturing , party leader rashid alvi on the eve of the lok sabha election results , on wednesday suggested that all regional secular parties should come together and elect west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee as the leader to keep bjp out of power .  even alvi unhesitatingly admitted that it may be difficult for congress to form the government  fully aware of mamata banerjees 's stand vis-a-vis the bjp and its leader narendra modi , alvi deftly mooted the name of west bengal chief minister , ignoring what his party vice-president rahul gandhi had said recently regarding the possibility of extending support to a third front government .  it may be recalled that during the course of electioneering , rahul gandhi had outrightly rejected the idea of his party supporting a secular front in case the upa falls short of the required numbers .  is alvi 's latest utterance a clear case of defiance or the congress after finally realising what effort to stop modi from taking over the reins from manmohan singh , is the big question doing rounds in the political circles . " it could be either , as someone within the congress is certainly going to throw the gauntlet and challenge the might of gandhi scion before things really take a turn for the worst , " feel political observers .  even alvi unhesitatingly admitted that it may be difficult for congress to form the government , he said , " it may be difficult for us to form the government , but all secular forces should come together to keep narendra modi at bay . "  he suggested that all regional secular parties should come together and elect their leader . " congress party will never hesitate to support a secular government , " asserted alvi .  " i suggest that regional parties should elect mamata banerjee , who is secular , competent and honest beyond doubt , as their leader , " added alvi .  erecting a firewall to save rahul after uttering somethings which was diametrically opposite to his stand , and truth will come out tomorrow , alvi said , " whether the congress conquers the electoral battle or loses it , we all shall be responsible for the credit or discredit . it will be injustice for anyone to only blame the leadership of congress . "  meanwhile , another congress leader sandeep dikshit conceded defeat before the declaration of results by stating that he was unlikely to win .  " i can speak for myself . i am unlikely to win . but i do n't speak for the party , " dikshit told an engligh news channel .
