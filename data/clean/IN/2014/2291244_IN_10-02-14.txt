The bridge was already 1 km longer and to accommodate the graveyard , it has further been extended by 200 kms . As a result , the slope of bridge is falling hardly 10 metre away from Lohiaya Chouraha . <p> This may increase chances of accidents as vehicles coming from bridges may bump into others moving around Chouraha . Similarly Puraniya bridge is coming in the way of Keshavnagar route . The 1100 metre long bridge 's construction started in June last year but local complain that corporation is repeating the same mistake it did in Raidas temple crossing . One end of bridge is falling towards the divider of Sitapur Road which may lead to accidents by people coming from Keshavnagar . <p> The 900 metre long Alamnagar railway over bridge whose construction started last year has left no space for residents of one end to move to the other end . The bridge is being constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge is posing problems to locals of Badshahkeda , Mayapuram and other adjoining localities as no space has been left for them to move towards the opposite side . A retaining wall has been made in between which would force people to move towards Rajajipuram and Alamnagar through the railway over bridge . <p> Though railway over bridge on mall avenue crossing is expected to reduce traffic burden on Kataiwala bridge but it would increase problems for people moving from cant area towards VIP road . <p> Currently , the vehicles easily pass Cant area and move towards VIP road in full speed . But once bridge comes into existence , the vehicles moving from Cant to Sultanpur Road will face traffic snarls whereas people driving on Mall Avenue bridge would have to carefully coke down while moving towards VIP road as they may hit other vehicles coming from Sultanpur Road and Kataiwala bridge . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .
