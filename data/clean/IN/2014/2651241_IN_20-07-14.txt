" we had n't done a play for children and we had n't worked with masks so this seemed very interesting to do . with children , the key is to keep them engaged . interesting images and action can engage them better than a barrage of words so it was exciting to use masks and puppets . "  he further explains that both plays have been devised by the team .  " while jujubee was completely written by us , how to skin a giraffe is inspired by leonce and lena , a play written by the iconic german playwright georg buchner . last year was the 200th year of buchner so the goette-institut asked us to work on this piece . the play was inspiring -- though buchner died at the age of 23 , he is regarded as the most outstanding german playwrights in history . the play has a . we took inspiration and reworked on it creating many new characters and approached the play very originally . it was a collaborative effort along with bangalore-based theatre group rafiki . "  both plays have a message about the world we live in , points out rajiv .  " how to skin a giraffe talks about the kind of automated life we lead without questioning how destiny or fate is steering us and how we are not really in control and locked in a kind of routine . we have reworked the play and changed our approach to the script . so it 's got a fresh vibe even for people who 've seen it earlier . "  looking ahead , rajiv says they will be taking jujubee to sri lanka next month and are keeping themselves busy with several plays and projects and will keep performing ms. meena , our longest running play since five years .  to summarise , how to skin a giraffe is about two dynasties ; a son , a daughter and a marriage of convenience . can fate be challenged or which will be performed from july 22 to 25at 7.30 p.m. and july 27 and 27 at 3.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m .  catch jujubee - a kingdom of rules with an evil king and an unlikely heroine -- with all its colour , music and puppets from july 25 to 27 at 11 a.m . call 9845602265 or visit www.perch.co.in for more details .
