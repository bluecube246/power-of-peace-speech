<h> Explore the wild side of Munnar- Online Exclusive <p> Planning a trip to Munnar ? There 's More to Munnar than tea gardens . Banu Solaiappan tells you what you can do there <p> My husband , being the spontaneous kind , whisked my brother and me on a two-day trip to Munnar . Driving down from Thrissur to Munnar , was uneventful for the first couple of hours of the four-hour drive , but the fun began at Angamaly -- where the ghat begins -- singing along to the music that the driver played and gawking at the lush greenery on either side of the road . After spending most part of my life in one concrete jungle or the other , the scent of the dense bushes and trees was refreshing . <p> We stayed in a two-bedroom cottage in the middle of a forest ; there is something about waking up to the chirping of birds . The place is a photographer 's paradise ! <p> Munnar has something for everyone . You can contact the DTPC office in the main town and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there . Adventure seekers can camp overnight , trek ( 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 hours ) , outdoor rock climbing , and river crossing . But we opted for a more relaxed holiday . Our first stop was by a tea estate . As I dressed up in a tea estate worker 's attire and had my picture taken I remembered why little girls like dressing up ! Next , we went to Elephant Park . Six tame elephants of the same height and size at one place and moving at the same pace , was a sight to behold . But feeling the giant creature 's muscles moving under you when it walked , was an unexplainable experience altogether . <p> Our next stop was the boat house at Maatuppatty dam . Wearing life jackets , we stepped onto the boat for a 20-minute ride in the lake surrounded by majestic eucalyptus trees . A few minutes into the ride , I let out a shriek as the boat driver maneuvered the boat to draw a figure eight . Apparently , all boat drivers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speciality of the boat ride ! <p> Our last stop was Kundala dam where we enjoyed a leisure walk and admired the birds and the lake . The temperature started dropping and a quick cup of hot tea later , we returned to our cottage . <p> Do n't miss : a night trek ; set up a tent , camp overnight and return the next day . If you are going to Munnar from Coimbatore , visit Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary , Thoovaanam waterfalls , and Eravikulam National Park . At Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary , you can go on a trek with a tribal guide to see 2000-year old rock paintings . From there , you can trek to Thoovaanam waterfalls.Laid-back tourists can try bird watching and a tour of a tea factory . <p> Do n't miss : a visit to the tour factory . Walk along with the tea estate workers and pluck tea leaves ; bring them back to the factory , and the workers will guide you on how to process tea . Process a kilo of your own tea leaves and take them home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film about Munnar.
