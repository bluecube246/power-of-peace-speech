<h> Google aims to bring half a million SMBs online in India by the end of 2015 <p> Google is working hard at getting more local businesses to sign up for its services in India . It aims to help bring around five lakh small and medium businesses ( SMB ) in India online by the end of next year and is already more than half way there . <p> The Internet giant already has three lakh SMBs in its kitty and aims to add two lakh more by the end of 2015 . Google 's VP and Global Head of SMBs , Allan Thygesen said that Google aims to increase the number of partners and support teams in the country to build its user base in India . " Helping SMBs succeed online is the key to our long-term success in India . There is a tremendous opportunity for small businesses to grow if they take advantage of online tools , and it will result in a better experience for users and for businesses , " Thygesen was quoted as saying by The Times of India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US to become the largest Internet market in the world , and it only makes sense for Google to woo SMBs in the country and bring them online . As of now , barely five percent of the 50 million SMBs in India have an online presence , a figure Google would be looking at changing soon . <p> K Suryanarayana , Google India 's SMB head said that it was affordable smartphones and the growth in the rate of its adoption which was bringing more users online . Indian SMBs , however , have been slow to adopt the online medium and strategise it because of lack of time and understanding of not just the Internet but also the self service model , he said . <p> Thygsen also pointed out to the fact that digital advertising spends form only 7 percent of the total ad spends for Indian enterprises , compared to 30 percent in the US . The e-commerce industry by itself which was at about $10 billion in 2013 is to touch $80-$100 billion marks by 2020.
