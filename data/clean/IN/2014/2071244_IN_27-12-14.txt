stranded , they dig up troves of antarctic data  rescued scientists bring back a warning about changes at the southern ice cap  the voyage was meant to retrace the steps of douglas mawson , the great polar explorer and scientist who led the australasian antarctic expedition of 1911 . what happened instead captured the world 's attention , something none of the scientists , journalists and paying public aboard could have foreseen .  the akademik shokalskiy got stuck in ice on christmas day 2013 only two weeks after leaving new zealand . a rescue mission swung into operation . chinese , french and australian icebreakers hurried to the scene only to be defeated by the ice floes .  with no icebreaker able to smash way through , a chinese helicopter , xue ying ( snow eagle ) , rose into the air for the first of five flights to ferry passengers from the stricken ship . a core crew remained behind to sail vessel home once conditions allowed .  media interest in the expedition faded after the rescue , but in the been busy . scientific samples and measurements from the voyage are being turned into research papers that reveal striking changes at the southern ice cap . and rather than feeling discouraged about expeditions that are funded by paying passengers , mr. turney is more enthusiastic than ever .  " once we got back home and made sure everyone was all right , we got on with working up the data and getting a whole load of papers ready for submission , " he said .  like the rescue mission , this involved plenty of waiting . " it took nearly six months to get all the samples through quarantine . " simple observations told unhappy stories . trawls of water reeled in hauls of plastic rubbish , now seemingly ubiquitous in the world 's oceans . on land , counts of adelie penguins revealed the population had slumped near mawson 's huts in commonwealth bay in east antarctica . the birds are now commuting 40 miles to get food for their young .  " another 10 years there probably wo n't be many left , " said mr. too .  commonwealth bay has experienced substantial changes in recent years . in summertime fierce katabatic winds blow off the continent and chill the surrounding surface water to freezing point . the freshly created ice blows out to sea , as if on a production line . but the freezing process leaves behind cold , dense water that sinks to the sea floor , forming part of an oceanic current that drives circulation on a global scale .  the ocean circulation at commonwealth bay was disrupted in 2010 after an enormous iceberg , b09b , arrived . the 30 mile -- long slab of ice smashed into the nearby mertz glacier tongue and grounded itself at the entrance to the bay . that blocked the exit for fresh sea ice . as the ice built up , the ocean conveyor system partially closed down .  such changes were bound to impact on life beneath the ice . scientists inspected ecosystems on the sea floor . " you see this remarkable transition with the expansion of sea ice . a lot of kelp and other life on the seabed of the deeper flora and fauna , as they come up from the deeper seabed because there 's an ecological niche to be filled , " said mr. turney . the shift in the ecosystem is expected to have impacts all the way up the food chain .
