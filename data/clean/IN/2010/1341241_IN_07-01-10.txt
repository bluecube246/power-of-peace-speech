priority in india is greenfield projects  creating roots : lafont says it 's important not to waste capital , and maximize efficiency to be able to earn higher returns . rajkumar/mint  updated : thu , jan 07 2010. 11 52 pm ist  new delhi : french cement maker lafarge sa has completed a decade of operations in the indian market , and reached an estimated $1 billion ( rs4,590 crore ) in annual revenue . the company is now looking at building cement plants in himachal pradesh , rajasthan , karnataka and meghalaya . bruno lafont , global chairman and ceo , lafarge , said in an interview that while the company 's focus is on new projects , it continues to keep an eye out for any acquisition opportunities in the cement market . edited excerpts :  i 'm coming regularly to india and what i 'm doing is , from time to time i spend almost half of my time in the operations and india is an important country for lafarge -- not only because it is large already , but to see how the strategy is developing and how the landscape is changing .  are you satisfied with the performance of the firm in india so far ?  i do not measure market share nationally . when you are talking about a ( sub ) continent , you have to look at it regionally . so market share is important regionally and it is even more true for us as we are in a local business . it 's a large country we are in , so we are looking at it regionally -- it 's true for the us , it 's true for russia , it 's true for china -- and if i look back , to 1999 , i think we have invested very wisely and we have continuously improved the operation and continuously invested . we are achieving the results which we were expecting , may be more , and we are looking at opportunities , i think , wisely . our goal is to be best building materials company in india . that requires a beginning and 10 years is not too much way to do business in the place is the right way and with that , having built strong teams and relying on strong and profitable assets then we can envisage growth with much more confidence .  tell us about your regional performance and strategy .  we are present in india with our three businesses . so when you look at cement , it is true that the selected region in the beginning was the north-east . our future developments will take us to other regions and we have selected one or two for the time being and we will grow through greenfield ( projects ) first . for ready-mix concrete , we made an acquisition last year and acquired the l&amp;t concrete business , which has a national coverage with 78 different ready-mix concrete plants . with this , we have a base to tap the construction market , and the last business we are in is plaster board . plaster board is a new product for india ; we are at the beginning of the penetration of the new product . it is lighter and offers more insulation to install . we have started off our plant last year , around delhi .  has n't there been a delay in your expansion to other regions ?  creating roots : lafont says it 's important not to waste capital , and maximize efficiency to be able to earn higher returns . rajkumar/mint  we are building our cement plants for 50 years , so we have to be careful and reasonable in computing growth . that is the first challenge . second , it 's good to be on time but it 's also good to be not too early . it 's not good to be too late , but you 've always some time to catch up if you 're delayed . what is important is really not to waste capital , to bring our operations to maximum efficiency , which we are doing , in order to be really able to maximize the return .  you have said that you expect consolidation in the indian cement industry -- are you looking at acquisitions yourself ?  lafarge , now worldwide , has a 70% is to serve those markets and to increase capacity when needed , and that is what we say an internal development programme on a very well diversified and well-balanced portfolio . our strategy is to give priority to cement in emerging markets so if we want to develop , we will use the money for cement in emerging markets . that means that for india we have selected to grow further through greenfields . why ? because consolidation was not happening or was not happening in the way that would make sense for us . but that does n't mean that we will never take part in consolidation . taking part in consolidation when you have a cement position somewhere is an opportunity because you can create synergies ; because you can have economies of scale ; you can optimise your network of production plants . you can spend more money to develop an efficient approach to customers and leverage also on innovation . that 's where it makes sense . i would say consolidation is always a quest . it does n't mean big acquisitions all the time but we , are acquisitions part of your growth plans in india ?  it 's not our priority today . our priority is greenfield ( projects ) , but it does n't mean that if consolidation opportunities happen , we will not look them and take part in them . what is important for us is to extend our position and that can be by all ways . what i look at in the end is " what type of asset do i get ? " . and an asset is one cement plant at least , with enough reserves with a potential to deliver ( to ) its market within a set cost and with a potential for us to improve the operations .  are there any offerings in the market which you are looking at ?  no , not right now . in fact , i do not expect a lot to happen very soon .
