washington , aug 18 : bad boys with aggressive nature and low parental monitoring are more likely to befriend people the same nature and become heavy drug users as teens , according to a new study .  the study by scientists from the universit ? de montr ? al and sainte-justine university hospital research center found that bad boys could be protected from heavy substance use as teenagers if they are highly monitored and befriend good boys as children .  parental monitoring was shown to have a protective effect on bad boys and reduce their affiliation with deviant peers , according to first author , jean-s ? bastien fallu , a universit ? de montr ? al psycho-education professor .  " disruptive boys typically show a proneness to act aggressively and impulsively -- these adolescents might need more external constraints from parents as compared to others who have stronger internal control , " fallu said .  co-author richard tremblay said that aggressive children are more inclined to misuse drugs than their non-aggressive counterparts and this risk increases substantially if they also affiliate with each other and mutually influence each other through deviancy training , " tremblay , who is also founding director of montreal 's centre of excellence for early childhood development said .  " another finding of our study was that disruptive boys who were highly monitored -- yet poorly attached to parents -- were heavier drug users , " he added .  " well monitored disruptive boys are more prone to affiliate with conventional peers . when such boys affiliate with conventional peers , they might benefit from a positive socializing influence or conformity training , " dr. fallu conversely said .
