<p> Washington , Aug 18 : Bad boys with aggressive nature and low parental monitoring are more likely to befriend people the same nature and become heavy drug users as teens , according to a new study . <p> The study by scientists from the Universit ? de Montr ? al and Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center found that bad boys could be protected from heavy substance use as teenagers if they are highly monitored and befriend good boys as children . <p> Parental monitoring was shown to have a protective effect on bad boys and reduce their affiliation with deviant peers , according to first author , Jean-S ? bastien Fallu , a Universit ? de Montr ? al psycho-education professor . <p> " Disruptive boys typically show a proneness to act aggressively and impulsively -- these adolescents might need more external constraints from parents as compared to others who have stronger internal control , " Fallu said . <p> Co-author Richard Tremblay said that aggressive children are more inclined to misuse drugs than their non-aggressive counterparts and this risk increases substantially if they also affiliate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and mutually influence each other through deviancy training , " Tremblay , who is also founding director of Montreal 's Centre of Excellence for Early Childhood Development said . <p> " Another finding of our study was that disruptive boys who were highly monitored -- yet poorly attached to parents -- were heavier drug users , " he added . <p> " Well monitored disruptive boys are more prone to affiliate with conventional peers . When such boys affiliate with conventional peers , they might benefit from a positive socializing influence or conformity training , " Dr. Fallu conversely said .
