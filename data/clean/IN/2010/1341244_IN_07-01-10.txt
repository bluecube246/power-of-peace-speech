nothing new about kutty 's music  january 07 , 2010 14:55 ist  director mithran r jawahar proved himself competent at remaking the hugely successful adavari matalaku arthale verule into tamil 's yaaradi nee mohini and this time , he 's returned to remake-land with gemini film circuit 's kutti ( originally arya , in telugu ) with dhanush in the lead and shriya saran providing the romantic angle .  music is tuned by devisri prasad , while vivega and thamarai share credit for the lyrics . here 's a look at how the tamil album has shaped up .  a brisk beat is the precursor to the lines , " if you keep smiling , you 'll be happy , if you do n't smile , you 'll get bp " of life-e jollythaan rendered by dsp and raina . there 's a strong whiff of dsp 's other telugu compositions , especially songs like adada adada from santhosh subramaniam . interspersed with 80s club music , the song 's tone is peppy and youthful and while not exactly original , does get begins with a congenial mixture of harmonica and violins and you 're eagerly awaiting a heart-wrenching romantic song but what you get is a mostly english rehash of the previous number .  k k 's voice is melodious , but you get a bit tired of the santhosh subramaniam refrain shot with whistles and flutes , after a while . the lyrics are mostly humdrum , touching the travails of young love in a superfluous fashion .  it takes a minute for you to get adjusted to the convoluted grammatical structure of the next song . but in a dsp number , who even cares ?  with tunes liberally borrowed from oh oh ethanai azhagu from adhe kangal , mukesh sings nee kadhalikkum ponnu , which is all about the trials faced by a young man who follows his beloved with unrequited love in his heart .  it 's part kuthu , part synthesized music , casual beat with male vocals touching high notes occasionally -- but not exactly new .  with a slow , almost folksy beat begins the longest track in the album , rendered by saagar in a nasal voice .  mildly melodious , this is once again a mish-mash of previous numbers with a telugu twang , mostly reminding you of the nee varumbothu number from mazhai .  the second version of feel my love , with a guitar strumming pleasantly in the background , sounds much better than the previous , synthesized version .  the vocals have been given more importance , and you get the feeling dsp has let himself walk away from the beaten path here . the rhythm is casual , the sax works well and there 's no effort to bombard your ear-drums . an appealing number but you only wish there had been more like it .  and there it is ! the pseudo-rural folksy song , kannu rendum sung by priya hamesh and mukesh , sounding remarkably close to kulicha kutralam from duet .  nothing much to say , except that it follows the usual pattern of such numbers , heavy on the percussion , ethnic instruments and colloquialisms .  kutty follows dsp 's pattern to the hilt , with or two moments , everything has a you've-heard-it-before feel .
