I play a hateful person in ' Karthik Calling Karthik ' : Ram Kapoor  Last updated : 16 January , 2010  Udaipur , Jan 16 ( IANS )  Popular television actor Ram Kapoor , who is sporting a new fit look after losing 11 kg , says he plays a mean and hateful person in his first mainstream Bollywood film ' Karthik Calling Karthik ' which also stars Farhan Akhtar .  " In ' Karthik Calling Karthik ' , I play the biggest problem in Farhan 's life . I play a bastard in the film - a mean , obnoxious , hateful person ... I ca n't disclose anything beyond this , " Kapoor said .  " Karthik Calling Karthik " also features Deepika Padukone and Shefali Shah . It has been produced by Farhan and Ritesh Sidhwani .  Kapoor , who was in this lake city for the launch of NDTV Imagine 's show " Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega " that he will be hosting , says both his films -- " Karthik Calling Karthik " and Anurag Kashyap  " These are two very interesting releases . Both the films are very good -- just like I wanted to do -- very metro films . It 's the kind of cinema that always interests me and the kind of cinema that I like to go and watch . I have given myself completely to these films and everybody is talking well about them so far , " Ram said .  The 36-year-old , who did a cameo in Mira Nair 's crossover film " Monsoon Wedding " in 2001 , says he is not taking on any major TV projects at the moment as he wants to see the fate of his movies first .  " At this point , it 's wise for me to wait for the releases to happen and then see if I get more cinema work like that . Then I 'll take it on . But if I get the kind of cinema I have always happily refused , I will take on television again . I love doing TV and I am lucky that I have reached a level where .  The actor , popular for shows like " Ghar Ek Mandir " and " Kasamh Se " , also says that TV means more business for him than being in cinema . " At my level , the money is fantastic in TV . In cinema , I 'm doing very good work with very good people , but the money that I make in cinema is not even one-tenth of what I make from TV .  " However , cinema is a choice I am gladly making because I consider it as a stepping stone . If I get the kind of work that I want , you will see me more in cinema ; if not , then I 'll be back to television , " he added .  Asked about his noticeable weight loss , Kapoor flashed a big smile and said : " I have lost 11 kilos . I just became serious about it . For the last three months , my eating is controlled , my drinking is controlled -- there 's no special formula or secret ( to it ) " This is something that I wanted to do for myself , my children , because it 's good to be healthy and it 's good even for my career . "  Kapoor is currently gearing up for the second season of NDTV Imagine 's " Swayamvar " . This time , Rahul Mahajan , son of slain Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader Pramod Mahajan , has set out to search for a suitable life partner amongst 15 shortlisted women . The show will begin Feb 1 .
