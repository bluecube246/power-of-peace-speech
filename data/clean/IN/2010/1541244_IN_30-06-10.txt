<h> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <h> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <p> Chennai is home to global and Indian auto majors like BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Mitsubishi , Nissan , Ashok Leyland , TVS Group , et cetera . It also has almost 35 per cent of India 's share of auto ancillary units . <p> So why has Chennai emerged as the Detroit of South Asia ? There are many reasons , not the least of which is the Tamil Nadu government 's investment-friendly industrial policy . <p> With an impressive growth of 26.42 per cent last year , India is the second fastest growing auto market in the world , next only to China that grew at a scorching 42 per cent . <p> There is a lot to cheer about for India if you look at what the Confederation of Indian Industry survey of auto ancillary companies ( Q2FY2010 ) says : ' India is estimated to have the potential to become one of the top five auto component manufacturing economies by 2025 . ' <p> ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global auto component outsourcing market , which is expected to be worth $700 billion by 2015 . With the spiralling demand from the domestic and international auto companies , the industry is emerging as one of the fastest growing manufacturing sectors in India and globally , ' the survey notes . <p> The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers ' statistics show that auto exports from India rose by 49.59 per cent last year . The CII survey also says that India 's exports of auto components would grow to $4.5 billion this year , compared with $1.8 billion in 2005 . <p> Click NEXT to read on . . . <p> Image : Hyundai cars ready for shipment at a port in Chennai.Photographs : Reuters <h> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <p> Export of two-wheelers , which account for about 77 per cent of the total automobile production in India , grew at 49.11 per cent , while the export of passenger vehicles -- which account for over 15 per cent of the total auto sales in the country -- grew by 10.23 per cent in May as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also interesting to note that the country 's second-largest bike maker Bajaj Auto showed a 51.23 per cent increase in exports while TVS Motors ' exports rose by 50.89 per cent . <p> Why India grew while the US and Europe suffered <p> Yezdi Nagporewala , head of automotive , KPMG India , cites reasons why the auto sector in India grew while the global automotive sector suffered . ' While developed countries have passenger vehicle penetration at 600-800 per 1,000 population , India is at an overall level of 10 per 1000 population . The low base combined with a growing middle class population has sustained India 's growth . ' <p> ' In 2008-09 , the Indian passenger vehicle market was growing at 15 per cent before the downturn hit in October 2008 . The subsequent quarter saw a period of de-growth . Indian passenger vehicle market recovered in 2008-09 to have a growth of 3-4 per cent in 2008-09 over 2007-08 . The pent up demand resurfaced in 2009-10 and each quarter saw significant jumps over previous quarters . The low base in 2008-09 has enabled a growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India released a stimulus package in 2008-09 to counter the recessionary trends . This included providing excise benefits to Indian automotive OEMs ( original equipment manufacturers ) , ensuring auto loan rates remained low . Auto OEM 's managed to pass on the benefits to the end customers . This was coupled with a series of new models launched which created excitement in the market . ' <p> ' Recessionary trends elsewhere enabled a low cost country like India to clock significant export numbers . India is primarily a hatchback ( small car ) market . There was increase in demand for hatchbacks during the previous two years in Europe and India benefited as it is emerging as a significant low cost manufacturing hub for hatchbacks. 30 per cent of all passenger vehicles manufactured in India were exported . This also added to the growth in production of Indian automotive OEM 's .

Out of these 15 are located in the southern states of the country . This shows that one-third of the concentration of the auto industries in India is in the four southern states . <p> In the southern states of India , there are about 74 projects which are at different stages from planning , implementation , or deferred . Of these , Tamil Nadu has the maximum number of projects ( 38 ) , followed by 24 in Karnataka , 10 in Andhra Pradesh , and 2 in Kerala . <p> Ford was the first global auto manufacturer to come to Chennai , and it was followed by many more . The latest to enter is Nissan . On being asked whether he was happy and satisfied with Chennai , the Ford India managing director , Michael Boneham , said , " Yes , we are satisfied . You have a very stable government and legislative environment . There is a transparent industrial policy no matter which political party is in power . You have governments very supportive of the industry . The second thing is the availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overall , we are very happy with our experience in Tamil Nadu . " <p> But he was not that excited about the state of infrastructure . " I would n't say I am happy . There are still significant challenges in power , in terms of road , rail , etc . The governments are trying to improve the infrastructure but we would like to see real evidence of them improving it on an ongoing basis , in a very sustainable and quick basis . " <p> Kiminobu Tokuyama , chief executive and managing director , Nissan Motor India Pvt Ltd , also expressed similar kind of views though his experience in Chennai is short . <p> " I do n't think we chose Chennai because the other international players have been here for some time . Not just Chennai , but Bengaluru too has a good supplier base . In fact , the entire southern area has a good supplier and good technology base . The quality of labour also is quite good in this part . Also , there is a strong support from the state government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being improved . " <h> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <p> Nissan is quite satisfied so far with the progress of the project as they could finish the plant in a record 21 months from the start . The managing director admitted that it was a record for even Nissan to build such a huge manufacturing plant in such a short period . <p> The company plans to export 110,000 cars in the first year , and it will go up to 180,000 the next year . And for the domestic market , they plan to hit 100,000 units per year . <p> " We had all the expertise but we would not have been able to achieve this without the support of Tamil Nadu government and the labour force . " <p> When the Nissan team met the Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister M K Stalin , they appreciated the support the government of Tamil Nadu had given so far and then requested the government to improve the road conditions . <p> " The infrastructure has to improve . As you know , we will start shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian market and for exports from our Oragadam plant . So we need good roads for speedy delivery . Infrastructure is one area that has to improve . " <p> Another auto company that is happy with Chennai is BMW that has set up base in the Mahindra City near Chennai . <h> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <p> Abhay Dange , general manager press and corporate affairs , BMW , says , " The first reason why BMW chose Chennai was because of the infrastructure provided by Mahindra City and Chennai . Then , the logistics like the facilities at the Chennai port . The single window clearance offered by the Tamil Nadu government attracted us and supported us . The experience in Chennai has been quite good so far . Mahindra World City is an excellent place . There may be power problems in other places but not in Mahindra World City . " <p> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <p> Ford 's Michael Boneham , however , does not agree with the observation that Chennai is the Detroit of Asia . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manner . But there are a number of automotive hubs in India , like Pune , and in Haryana and Gujarat , etc . My view is that it is good to have balanced development of the automotive sector across the country , not just in one area . " <p> Yezdi Nagporewala observes , " Chennai has the potential to become one of the top three automobile hubs in the world . Today , Chennai accounts for 30 per cent of India 's share of automobile industry and 35 percent of India 's auto components segment . <p> " However , despite being around 60 years old , the domestic auto industry lags behind other countries like South Korea , Brazil and Mexico in terms of production and sales . While it attracts lot of foreign direct investment due to its cost competitiveness , it is yet to match Chinese cost structure and the ease of conducting business . " <p> " Further , while Chennai has catapulted itself to be a manufacturing hub , its research and technological spend is much lower than its Asian peers . Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest significantly in research and development , " says Nagporewala . <p> " Also to maintain its global competitiveness , the government has to continuously work on developing infrastructure in the cluster . Infrastructure poses the most visible and obvious challenge for Chennai 's development today . Considerable investment is required to improve the city 's rail , road and port infrastructure , " Nagporewala adds . <h> Chennai , the Detroit of Asia ? <p> " As per the Eleventh Five-Year Plan report , in the next seven to eight years , the automotive sector in Chennai is expected to grow into a business of $15-20 billion with nearly 500,00 additional jobs . The sheer scale of operations will create availability of talent as a major constraint . " <p> So , the question is , does that qualify Chennai to be the Detroit of Asia ? <p> Future of the auto industry : <p> According to the CII survey , the Indian automotive industry is expected to grow at the rate of about 13 per cent per annum over the next decade to reach a size of around $165-175 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component industry is also expected to grow at 12 per cent over the next decade to reach around $160 billion by 2016 . <p> Nagporewala predicts a growth of 12-14 per cent over the next 5 years for the Indian passenger vehicle market . Export sales will grow at a rate higher than domestic sales . <p> According to Tokuyama , the Indian market will soon reach 3 million cars and in a few years ' time , it will reach 5-6 million cars . " There is a huge potential for Indian growth . The total market will , anyway , be growing but if you compare segment by segment , the small car segment will grow faster than the other segments . " <p> Michael Boneham also agrees with the view that it will be the small car segment that will grow the most . " We expect the segment to grow by 20 per cent year over year . That is the growth that is sustainable . I expect double-digit growth for the next 4-5 years . Then , you have to wait and see . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on a number of other factors . But I am quite confident that we will see substantial double-digit growth in that segment . " <p> " To be frank with you , " adds Boneham , all other segments in the automobile industry in India are also growing . That is good news for manufacturers and customers because they are getting much more choice now . " <p> He also said that " India will be one of the three countries that will have the highest growth . We see significant growth potential here provided infrastructure keeps up with the opportunity for growth and demand . I do n't see any reason why India ca n't be the fastest growing market globally . But it has a long way to go . " <p> Image : Car containers wait at a port to be shipped out.Photographs : Reuters
