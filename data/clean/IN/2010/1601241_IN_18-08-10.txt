This is the third case of an actor suffering from Malaria . Earlier it was Gurmeet Chaudhary and Sanaya Irani , now its Ratan Rajpoot from ' Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo ' , who has fallen prey to Malaria . When the entire nation was celebrating Independence Day , our very own Laali was hospitalized at Ambani Hospital for almost 2 hours .  " My sister had come down on 15th August to be with me but unfortunately on the same day I was hospitalised . My doctor has advised me to take three days rest in the hospital but due to work commitments I had to resume work with in 2 hours . I was feeling very uncomfortable before getting hospitalised . Though now I am some how managing to work but I am really not in the condition to work . " says Ratan in a low voice .  Being a strong girl , just like she portrays in her character , she is managing work even in this condition , " Since its malaria , my fever keeps fluctuating , extra medicinal tablets also , so that I get some rest . But nothing works ; this malaria will definitely take its own time to cure . I am really thankful to my co actors , they are really very co-operative and very caring of me on the sets . " signs off Ratan .  We wish Ratan a very speedy recovery ! But Ratan remember ' Health is Wealth ' , so we too advise you to take some rest and get well soon .
