this is the third case of an actor suffering from malaria . earlier it was gurmeet chaudhary and sanaya irani , now its ratan rajpoot from ' agle janam mohe bitiya hi kijo ' , who has fallen prey to malaria . when the entire nation was celebrating independence day , our very own laali was hospitalized at ambani hospital for almost 2 hours .  " my sister had come down on 15th august to be with me but unfortunately on the same day i was hospitalised . my doctor has advised me to take three days rest in the hospital but due to work commitments i had to resume work with in 2 hours . i was feeling very uncomfortable before getting hospitalised . though now i am some how managing to work but i am really not in the condition to work . " says ratan in a low voice .  being a strong girl , just like she portrays in her character , she is managing work even in this condition , " since its malaria , my fever keeps fluctuating , extra medicinal tablets also , so that i get some rest . but nothing works ; this malaria will definitely take its own time to cure . i am really thankful to my co actors , they are really very co-operative and very caring of me on the sets . " signs off ratan .  we wish ratan a very speedy recovery ! but ratan remember ' health is wealth ' , so we too advise you to take some rest and get well soon .
