mumbai , feb. 11 : giving a new twist to the ongoing controversy over screening of bollywood movie ' ' my name is khan ' ' , maharashtra navnirman sena chief raj thackeray on thursday said that his outfit would not disrupt the screening of the film .  raj thackeray , the estranged nephew of shiv sena chief bal thackeray , slammed the latter 's party for targeting shah rukh khan but not saying anything to bollywood superstar amitabh bachchan , who shared the dais with pakistan artistes a few days ago .  " i am not very close to shah rukh nor am i close to amitabh bachchan . but still i can not figure out why the shah rukh versus sena ( shiv sena ) issue has been blown out of proportion . however , i just need to bring such contradictions to your notice that i am not going to stage any protests on this issue , " said raj thackeray .  thackeray also criticized khan saying that though he was vocal about his support to pakistan players , he had team , the kolkata knight riders ' ' .  thackeray further questioned that why there weren ' ' t any complaints against amitabh bachchan , who shared the stage dais with pakistan artistes .  " amitabh refused an australian award due to indian students being attacked in australia , then how can he share the stage with the pakistan artiste , who hails from the land of the militants who attacked mumbai on 26/11 ? " raj thackeray demanded .  ' ' my name is khan ' ' has already been targeted by shiv sena , which triggered a debate that resonated across the country last week , after it criticized the film ' ' s star , shah rukh khan , for saying that pakistani players ought to have been included in india ' ' s cricket league .  shiv sena activists have been targeting theatres and warning theatre-operators to not screen ' ' my name is khan ' ' , which releases on friday ( february 12 ) .  activists have already vandalized many cinemas in mumbai , even though there were showing other effigies of khan , and tore down posters of the film and burnt them all across india ' ' s western state of maharashtra .  khan , who was on a promotional tour in new york and london , has said that he stands by his statement .  fox star studios bought the distribution rights for ' ' my name is khan ' ' , in what is said to be the biggest distribution deal in bollywood . trade analysts say there are at least 1.2 billion rupees ( nearly $25.9 million ) riding on the film and if the mumbai-maharashtra circuit is affected , it would affect almost 25 percent of the film ' ' s cinema revenues .  in the film , shah rukh khan plays a man with asperger ' ' s syndrome who is a victim of the anti-muslim bias in the us in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks .
