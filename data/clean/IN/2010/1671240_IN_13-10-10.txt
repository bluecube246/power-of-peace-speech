TNN Oct 13 , 2010 , 10.16 PM IST  VADODARA/ANAND : After the elections for the six municipal corporations got over , the attention has shifted to nagarpalika polls . In Anand district , where elections for the board of five nagarpalikas are scheduled on October 21 , the battle to capture the civic body of Anand town is likely to be intense .  Interestingly , it is for the first time that Congress has fielded party candidates instead of declaring outside support to independents . For 42 seats of the 14 wards of Anand nagarpalika , a total of 146 candidates are in fray . While BJP has nominated 39 candidates , Congress has fielded 42 candidates . are 59 independents in the fray . So , though it is a direct fight between BJP and Congress for most of the seats , the poll battle is turning interesting thanks to the presence of independents .  Of the 39 candidates fielded by the BJP , the party has repeated 17 of its councilors . Those denied tickets by the party this time include former Nagarpalika president Jayraj Patel and former deputy president and old RSS hand Ghanshyam Khatri . Another former BJP councillor Chetan Patel alias Akku , who was suspended from the party recently , is now contesting as an independent .  Sources suggest that a majority of candidates fielded by BJP are supporters of Vijay Patel alias Master who had joined the BJP after contesting the last elections under an independent banner - Vikas Manch .  It was thanks to the support of 12 independents , led by Vijay Master , that BJP which had bagged 19 seats after the 2005 elections , and managed to form a board in the civic body .  For the first time , three syndicate members of polls . While SPU 's syndicate member DC Patel is leading the Congress panel , BJP 's sitting councillor and syndicate member Pragnesh Patel is also in the fray . This apart , Bipin Vakil , who is president of education trust Anand People 's Medicare Society and also a syndicate member , is contesting the polls under the banner of Sarvapakshiya Dal .
