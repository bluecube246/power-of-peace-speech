the two-day- trip to the misty hills of coorg was a memorable experience with rappelling , night drives , kayaking and above all an opportunity to make new friends .  have you ever been on a trip with people you knew nothing about ? ever knew what a family outside your family feels like ? well , i had n't . at least not until the most memorable trip of my life -- the national management school outbound programme for students at coorg . the two-day-trip was part of our orientation , designed to enable us to bond better , discover something new about ourselves , and merge into a team .  thrilling day  an overnight trip from chennai and a few hours of rugged drive brought us to the camp site . our program facilitators greeted us and helped us settle in quickly . after a quick lunch we departed for rappelling on a waterfall . topaz , our main facilitator , gave us a demo on rappelling .  after a brief explanation on the harness , and an inspirational speech , did us a world of good by giving us the motivation needed to do the ' impossible ' .  we descended to the base of the fall with great caution . after we all re-assembled at the top , topaz asked four of us to volunteer for a task -- two of us are to be rescued and two to be the rescuers . i thought it was going to be cakewalk , but half way down , i realized i had bitten off more than i could chew . by god 's grace we somehow reached the bottom in one piece ! this exercise really gave me a new perspective on team-work . after a tiring session , we returned to the camp site , freshened up , and readied ourselves for the bonfire-dinner . the facilitating team -- topaz , ashley and sagar -- joined us for dinner and very soon had us all sharing about ourselves ; even things we never thought we would talk about . soon , i realised this random batch of strangers was beginning to be like my family . after dinner , us earlier that sagar would take us around the winding roads of coorg at 80kmph ! " that 's rubbish " i thought , but it soon became evident that topaz was n't joking . ' a hair-raising experience ' would be an understatement . a steep drop on one side , and this guy was doing 80kmph with his headlights switched off ! scary as it may sound , it was one of the best experiences of my life . we had enough thrills for one day , and so we decided it was time to hit the sack .  kayaking  the next morning we planned some water sports , but the rain and the swelling waters compelled us to do a milder but equally engaging activity -- -- kayaking . we had no time to lose . the following session was the final piece . topaz gave us an hour long motivational speech.i 've heard many motivational speeches , but what set this one apart was the personal nature of his talk .  i know it 's a clich ? , but all good things must back to mysore seemed to take forever . but at the end of the day , we had to get back to reality . and when i look back at those two days , i feel the programme helped me to improve my personality and to bond well with the classmates with whom i will be spending the next two years . i wish we had spent more time at the camp , and i hope to go on more trips with my new found family at the national management school .
