<p> The paper showed significant differences between the Centre and the states on the proposed GST architecture , beginning with the number of tax slabs . <p> New Delhi 's position is far closer than that of the states to a model advocated by a task force set up by the 13th Finance Commission ( TFC ) . <p> In addition to advocating a single tax slab , which keeps down the tax rate , TFC 's task force had also suggested bringing in petroleum products , alcohol , electricity , purchase tax ( which is levied by some states on foodgrains ) into the GST tax base . TFC had recommended 12% as the revenue-neutral rate for GST , which was later rejected by the states . <p> The paper , however , sheds no light on bringing stamp duty on real estate into the GST architecture , a move recommended by TFC 's task force . <p> Mint had on 8 January reported talks between the Union government and the states on GST were deadlocked as the states felt the TFC task force December report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> P. Chidambaram , then finance minister , had said 1 April 2010 would be the deadline to roll out GST . Since then , finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has indicated the deadline can not be met as there is no consensus between the Centre and the states on GST architecture .
