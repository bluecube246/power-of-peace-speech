agitated members have sent a letter to the chief minister 's cell requesting her intervention .  residents of triplicane , visiting devotees and heritage enthusiasts are at loggerheads with the parthasarathy temple authorities . they are protesting against the ongoing construction at the temple meant to cover the parakara or circumambulatory passage .  in their opinion , the construction is impairing the architectural character of the temple and denying the faithful a venerable view of the gopura ( temple gateway ) and vimana ( tower over the sanctum ) . they are also upset with the temple authorities for insensitively replacing the old granite floor with a relatively polished stone that is proving inconvenient to walk .  agitated members have sent a letter to the chief minister 's cell requesting her intervention .  the parthasarathy temple is one of the important vaishnavite shrines in the country and literary references about it are datable to the 6th century ad . the iconography of the main deities is older and historians think the six icons in the sanctum are a part of a much-older vrsni not as old . the temple was regularly modified and new structures were added .  " the parthasarathy temple , like other south indian temples , has a distinctive character with a high compound wall , large towers , pillared halls and open prakaras . over a period , people in power have insensitively modified this heritage structure . what is now left is the open space around the inner sanctum . if you cover the last of the open prakara with a roof , it would no more be a temple but a kalyana mandapam marriage hall with some shrines in it , " said an agitated r.k. ragavendran , a resident of triplicane and a regular at the temple .  c.r. srinivasan , an 80-year-old devotee is unhappy with the authorities for changing traditions and history . " old ways of keeping up the temple and taking people into consideration has changed for worse , " he said .  the temple officials in their defense explained that all aspects of worship and convenience were considered before starting the construction .  " we discussed with the is only a translucent roof , which will let in sunlight and provide shade at the same time . we often cover the space during festivals using temporary materials . this used to add to the cost of conducting the festivals . the new construction will reduce the recurring cost and help perform the rituals conveniently . though the roof covers the prakara , a portion of it is left open so that devotes can view the gopura and vimana without hindrance , " they added .
