Barking Dog needs more bite

The script and scenes of The Good Doctor staged by a young group The Barking Dog called for better treatment  It 's a small but receptive audience at the Alliance Fran ? aise auditorium in Chennai , where Bangalore-based Barking Dog is performing Neil Simon 's The Good Doctor . The performance and the laughter are both on cue , with no real surprises . Neil Simon has become pretty much a staple on the theatre scene and his one-liners can usually be trusted to carry the day if nothing else suffices .  The Good Doctor , of course , is not a full play , but a series of early sketches that Neil Simon did as a sort of homage to Anton Chekhov " before getting on to bigger things " . The pieces are linked by the character of the writer ( Chekhov ) and the skits are pieces he has written , a ploy that director N. Rishi exploits rather well , with the writer , rapt in inspiration , busily jotting in his notebook and mouthing the dialogues even as the themselves are uneven in quality , a fact that Neil Simon has acknowledged , and this evening the unevenness of the script ( and its datedness ) is somewhat exacerbated by the inadequacies of the production . It does n't , however , take away from the performance of lead actor Prateek Prajosh , who is excellent as the writer . A natural , with easy movements , a mobile face and a nice way of delivering his lines , he does a great job . The rest of the cast is competent . Rishi is funny as the sexton having his tooth pulled out by a quack , and Mohan Ram is best in his role as General Brassilhov . Clearly , a lot is expected from Deepak Hariharan , who plays some key roles -- the seducer charming the married woman ; the hobo willing to drown himself for three kopeks ; and the young boy hauled off to a prostitute by a concerned father who wants him to learn about the birds and the bees . Not all of it works , though . Deepak has too young that of a sophisticated rake and does the simpleton sneezer role better .  And what is that interlude where Deepak and Shraddha Srinath play an ageing couple who meet on a park bench and break into song ? It looks suspiciously like it was dragged in to showcase some singing talent and is totally unconvincing . Among the women , Shraddha overdoes the haughty expression and one gets tired of it after a while ; while Sindhu Sreenivasa Murthy as the shrewish woman who terrorises the bank manager overplays the role , coming across more as a demented creature than a scheming woman who uses tears and shrieks to telling effect .  But most of all , what one realises after an evening like this is the tragic paucity of contemporary Indian scripts and plays . In 2012 , when there is cutting-edge work in Indian cinema and other arts , why is urban English theatre revisiting clich ? d 18 century situations set in Russia presented second-hand via an American playwright ? I would understand if it came from their parents , but not when it 's from two linchpins have actually given up enticing corporate careers for professional theatre .  In fact , the story of Barking Dog is vastly more interesting . Vikram Hemanathan tells me that he and partner Rishi are confident that their company will soon be fully financially viable ; he speaks of how they started with all of Rs. 5,000 ; he tells me they are already doing well enough to pay for actors and sets . This is impressive . Now , let 's wait for this youthful team ( average age below 21 ) to soon come up with a relevant , funky , and way-out production . Something tells me they well might .
