in pics : supernova turned massive star ' inside out ' !  in pics : supernova turned massive star ' inside out ' !  a new x-ray study of the remnants of an exploded star suggests that the supernova that disrupted the massive star may have turned it inside out in the process .  using very long observations of cassiopeia a ( or cas a ) , a team of scientists has mapped the distribution of elements in the supernova remnant in unprecedented detail .  this information shows where the different layers of the pre-supernova star are located 300 years after the explosion , and provides insight into the nature of the supernova .  an artist 's illustration showed a simplified picture of the inner layers of the star that formed cas a just before it exploded , with the predominant concentrations of different elements represented by different colours : iron in the core ( blue ) , overlaid by sulphur and silicon ( green ) , then magnesium , neon and oxygen ( red ) .  click next to read massive star that became the cassiopeia a supernova remnant may have turned inside out as it explodedphotographs : courtsey : nasa , http : //chandra.harvard.edu  in pics : supernova turned massive star ' inside out ' !  the image from nasa 's chandra x-ray observatory used the same colour scheme to show the distribution of iron , sulphur and magnesium in the supernova remnant .  the data show that the distributions of sulphur and silicon are similar , as are the distributions of magnesium and neon .  oxygen , which according to theoretical models is the most abundant element in the remnant , is difficult to detect because the x-ray emission characteristic of oxygen ions is strongly absorbed by gas in along the line of sight to cas a , and because almost all the oxygen ions have had all their electrons stripped away .  a comparison of the illustration and the chandra element map shows clearly that most of the iron , which according to theoretical models of the pre-supernova was originally on the inside of the star , is now located near the outer further ...  image : this spectacular image of the supernova remnant cassiopeia a is the most detailed image ever made of the remains of an exploded starphotographs : courtsey : nasa , http : //chandra.harvard.edu  in pics : supernova turned massive star ' inside out ' !  surprisingly , there is no evidence from x-ray ( chandra ) or infrared ( spitzer space telescope ) observations for iron near the center of the remnant , where it was formed .  also , much of the silicon and sulphur , as well as the magnesium , is now found toward the outer edges of the still-expanding debris . the distribution of the elements indicates that a strong instability in the explosion process somehow turned the star inside out .  this latest work , which builds on earlier chandra observations , represents the most detailed study ever made of x-ray emitting debris in cas a , or any other supernova remnant resulting from the explosion of a massive star .  it is based on a million seconds of chandra observing time . tallying up what they see amount of x-ray emitting debris has a mass just over three times that of the sun .  this debris was found to contain about 0.13 times the mass of the sun in iron , 0.03 in sulphur and only 0.01 in magnesium .  click next to read further ...  image : a composite image of cassiopeia aphotographs : courtesy : nasa and the hubble heritage team  in pics : supernova turned massive star ' inside out ' !  the researchers found clumps of almost pure iron , indicating that this material must have been produced by nuclear reactions near the centre of the pre-supernova star , where the neutron star was formed .  that such pure iron should exist was anticipated because another signature of this type of nuclear reaction is the formation of the radioactive nucleus titanium-44 , or ti-44 .  emission from ti-44 , which is unstable with a half-life of 63 years , has been detected in cas a with several high-energy observatories including the compton gamma ray observatory , bepposax , and the international gamma-ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) journal .  image : this x-ray image shows an expanding shell of hot gas produced by the explosion . this gaseous shell is about 10 light years in diameter , and has a temperature of about 50 million degreesphotographs : courtsey : nasa , http : //chandra.harvard.edu
