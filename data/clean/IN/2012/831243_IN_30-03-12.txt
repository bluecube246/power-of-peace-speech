news , reviews , information and apps for nokia and symbian .  review : traintiles  score:88%  with stunningly clear animated graphics , traintiles is an increasingly frantic ' arcade puzzler ' , seeing you rotating track segments in order to keep various trains running smoothly and headed towards their destinations . it 's immaculately ( and cutely ) presented and just about the only negative i can throw at it is that the levels get very hard very quickly - if you have a quick enough mind and quicker fingers then traintiles is a must-buy .  from splash screen to ' about ' screen , it 's clear that traintiles has been something of a labour of love by the developers . atmospheric , attractive :  traintiles has a similar overall arc to angry birds - the now well established packs of levels , set in different parts of the world , gradually getting unlocked as you progress . curiously , only part of each area has to be solved , though this does happily get round the situation where you 're area until you get past the problem one .  the idea in traintiles is that the track is made up of straight and curved ( and ' crossroad ' ) pieces , arranged on a grid . tapping a track piece rotates it , as shown in the first of several tutorial animations below .  as you might expect , the first few levels are easy , introducing the track pieces and ways in which you 'll need to rotate them in real time , but things quickly get much harder . multiple trains running at the same time , to multiple destinations , as shown below :  it soon becomes apparent that most central pieces of track need to be used several times per level in different configurations , usually with some split second timing to switch a curved section a split second after one train has used it and just before the next train needs it - to go in a different direction .  add in more and more trains . add in the possibility ( or , in the case of the puzzle designer . add in ever more complex layouts , and you can see where all this is going . classic game territory , that 's where .  as with other arcade puzzlers ( e.g. flight control ) , there 's a " oh heck , here comes another train , i 'm still juggling two others as it is " degree of increasing freneticism , plus the enticing sight of a ' replay ' /'retry ' icon when you fail ( " surely i 'll get it right this time " , etc . )  within each level pack , you do have to solve every puzzle in order to unlock the next one , but a ) you can go back and replay earlier , easier levels if you want to remind yourself of some of the techniques that got you so far and b ) as mentioned earlier , other level packs get unlocked before you 've finished the current one , so you can simply jump packs for an easy change of scenery .  talking of scenery , it 's immaculate here . around the central used , trees wave gently in the wind , birds fly overhead , and more ... all this graphical action has meant that only the gpu-accelerated symbian3 generation of smartphones are supported , but you can see where some of the processor power is going , at least .  there 's excellent sound too , with train ' chuffing ' ( of course ) , atmospheric musical jingles , wind noise ( appropriate to the pack being played ) , crash effects , brake squeals , and so on . it 's very immersive . my only complaint would be that there 's no volume control - sound is either on or off .  perfectly implemented , great fun to play , even a ? 3 price tag does n't stop me recommending this as one of the very top symbian game titles . if you have even the slightest interest in puzzle games then run , do n't walk , to buy traintiles . it 's that good .
