<h> Mhada colonies want Govt to revert to premium system <p> Over 9,000 housing societies in 56 Mhada layouts in Mumbai are seeking the Government 's nod to go by its earlier redevelopment rules . <p> Mhada ( Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority ) is the Government agency which constructs residential buildings to house different sections of society . The sizes of Mhada apartments , in general , vary from 180 sqft to about 450 sqft . <p> Over four lakh people reside in these colonies , where buildings are dilapidated and beyond repair . <h> Premium system <p> Prior to 2010 , the Government had permitted redevelopment of these Mhada colonies on payment of 40 per cent premium for the additional FSI ( floor space index ) the buildings qualified for . The premium is on the ready reckoner rate ( guideline value ) . <p> This incentive was extended as poorer sections resided in the colonies and it was not possible for them to bear the redevelopment cost . It enabled developers to rebuild existing homes and also make their money by selling the free sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructions are independent towers which are separated from the redevelopment portions . <p> There are cases of developers buying out existing tenants and also some where the lower floors are reserved for tenants . <h> FSI incentive <p> In 2010 , the rules were modified and an FSI of 2.5 was given for redevelopment . Of this , one was for the existing buildings and the balance would be shared between the developer and Mhada ( 0.75 each ) . The developer could sell his portion in the open market and Mhada would get back apartments for its rental scheme . <p> In the present case , the tenants have sought 484 sqft units . This meant that more FSI would be consumed for existing buildings . Consequently , as redevelopment calculations are based on FSI , Mhada share would be higher and the developers ' share lower to that extent . This is unattractive to developers . <p> Developers who had signed agreements with about 1000 of the 9000-odd housing societies are unwilling to take up work . <p> Ramesh Prabhu , Chairman , Maharashra Societies Welfare Association , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for middle income group housing schemes . <p> Conceding , that the incentive FSI of 2.5 would not conform to the societies ' requirement , he said the government would stand to gain Rs 10,000 if it collected the premium instead .
