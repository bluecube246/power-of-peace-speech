US Military close to developing Hypersonic bombers  Washington : US is close to developing a hypersonic bomber able to reach any target on the globe in under an hour .  The US military hopes to fly such hypersonic planes capable of moving at 20 times the speed of sound by 2016 , the NBC News reported quoting American officials working on the project .  The vehicle would be " recoverable " , US government officials working on developing the full-scale rocket plane said .  The hypersonic bomber codenamed the X-Plane will travel at Mach 20 ( roughly 20,900 kilometers per hour ) and the project is being carried out by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , which has developed stealth aircrafts for US government for 30 years .  DARPA has conducted two test flights of prototype hypersonic aircraft in the past two years . In August last year , the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 ( HTV-2 ) reached Mach 20 , but only remained airborne for nine minutes .  The HTV-2 was developed in conjunction with goal of creating a bomber able to reach any target on the globe in under an hour .  The US government has started a new programme called Integrated Hypersonics with an aim to develop ultra-fast fighters and the project is in response to the US military advantage being threatened by other nations ' increasing abilities in stealth and counter-stealth warfare .  " We do not yet have a complete hypersonic system solution , " said Gregory Hulcher , director of strategic warfare at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology and Logistics , said in a statement .  " Programme like Integrated Hypersonics will leverage previous investments in this field and continue to reduce risk , inform development and advance capabilities . "  The programme 's research will focus on five key areas : thermal protection system and hot structures ; aerodynamics ; guidance , navigation and control ( GNC ) ; range/instrumentation ; and propulsion . Thermal protection is a crucial issue for hypersonic flight , which is defined as anything over Mach 5 . A vehicle flying inside the atmosphere degrees Celsius - hot enough to melt steel . The project will also aim to improve design and manufacturing processes , in order to able faster production .
