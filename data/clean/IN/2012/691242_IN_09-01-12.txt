<h> What does Ferguson have planned for Scholes ? <p> In many ways , it was the perfect Alex Ferguson ploy . Clever , sly , swift and surprising . <p> The return of Paul Scholes in a Manchester derby will be something which will be told as a tale when current Manchester United fans pass on their passion to those who are yet to come and to those who are floating in the limbo of being a neutral fan . In English football , you never remain a neutral ; you take sides and get recruited . <p> Scholes ' comeback could be one such event , or it could just be one massive failure to squeeze out whatever talent the red-headed man has left in him , along with a stamina that he has kept warm due to his coaching indulgence . <p> Of course , the argument of whether Sir Alex should really have recalled the former talisman or not flared up as soon as he lost the ball , eventually resulting in the cross that allowed Sergio Aguero to slip one under Anders Lindegaard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly turned the colour of United 's kit at 3-2 . <p> And the obvious question is ... is Ferguson 's move justified ? <p> But the more interesting one is what exactly made Scholes return . <p> Usually headstrong in his decisions and unwavering in his commitment towards himself and his family , there must be something that made him cross his own path . <p> With Scholes being one of the most media-shy player to ever play in the Premier League , this move has nothing to do with gaining attention . In fact , if there was one thing which must have stood between him and his manager 's wish , then it is his likeness for keeping out of the limelight . The silent predator . <p> Even in the interview after his retirement , he was scarily quiet and composed in his answers , apart from a minor twitch he displays when he dislikes any question . When he was asked how he felt when Xavi and Zidane praised him for his midfield prowess , all he said was , " Yea , it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice ' was barely caught on the microphone . <p> Considering all this , there is certainly something he sensed at Old Trafford . And this must have been pretty grave , because the Scot could have easily picked Paul Pogba or Darren Gibson or more importantly , just buy someone . <p> But he goes for this 37-year-old man who admitted that one of the reasons for retirement was a realisation that he was n't contributing enough to the team . He had receded into a deeper role over the last couple of years and United fans need to stop dreaming that he is here to score goals and win matches . <p> The more realistic expectation would be to see him come in the last 15-20 minutes and prevent them from throwing away the match in the abrasive manner they have been in against Newcastle , Blackburn and more importantly , FC Basel . <p> In football terms , he will play the role of the anchorman , reliving at times what people say about him : " When Scholes has the ball , the match seems to pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incite a change in his midfielders ' attitudes . With Scholes around , no one is guaranteed a place . More competition , better training , better performance on the field . <p> Or maybe he has suddenly found the keys to his ever-locked jaws and is uttering some words which can encourage the youngsters into doing better . With Fergie 70 now , and well-known for his flamboyant manner in which he treats the players , they need someone to talk to . A sort of a buffer between players and manager . That would be perfect but just does n't seem to fit the personality profile of Scholes . <p> The wildest thought would be grooming him for the future . After coaching , getting into man-management is the next step . With not more than five years left in Ferguson 's tenure , this is the ideal moment to groom someone from the midst . Someone who has been there , done that . <p> Imagining Scholes standing on the touchline jumping up and down ? Long shot , but football is as unpredictable as it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories to be concretely answered and maybe this article will have the same theme come the end of May , just a different headline and either lines of effusive praise or sullen criticism . Maybe something on the lines of ' Scholes screamer takes United to the top of the table ... ' <p> United fans must have hardly celebrated after the final whistle of the derby . It was more of a sigh of relief , the kind when a man finally feels land under him after a stormy ride in the ocean . <p> Core of the problem is that one pass which is lacking for the Red Devils . That one pass which wrong-foots the best defender , allowing the poaching talent of Javier Hernandez , Danny Welbeck and Dimitar Berbatov flourish . And to execute that one lethal touch , there are few as good as Paul Scholes . <p> Even when the ball was laid up for him in the derby , you could see in that one fleeting second that Scholes has lost none of his old touch . The perfect body shape , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner which has seen it rip the net out on so many occasions was proof enough that it does n't take a mere six months to lose your touch . <p> Form is temporary , class is permanent . <p> Similarly you could argue ... how does six months change a man so much ? <p> This move is also , in plain terms , a slap on the face of Anderson . The Brazilian midfielder was given a good run in the squad last winter and managed to establish himself with a string of fair performances for his team . But his return has seen him being used very carefully , with a certain caution to not elevate him to the status of primary playmaker at Old Trafford . <p> The return of Tom Cleverley is what United fans want the most , and with him being mentioned by the gaffer as their best performer in the initial part of the season , there is no way he will rush in the Englishman . That leaves Paul Scholes to fill in the gaps . <p> The question hovering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a follower of the game , one must enjoy it . <p> Just as we savour every sip of a mature wine with its taste bonded in time , we must savour every touch of a genius .
