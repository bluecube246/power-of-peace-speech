<h> With jati intact <p> If one wanted to know how special Vempati Chinna Satyam 's method of teaching dance was , you could find no better example than Sasikala , his student , now living in USA and her sister Nandini , from the way they presented some dance numbers at Telugu University auditorium last Friday . This occasion was steered by Vamsee International , a wing of Vamsee Art Theaters . <p> Sasikala opened with a prayer to Vinayaka -- Pranamamyaham Gowrisutam of Vasudevacharya in Gowla followed by Thyagaraja 's Ksheerasagara Sayana in Devagandhari . The very rendition of pallavi in myriad patterns was matched by her sancharis in abhinaya combined with brisk footwork . Vocalist D.S.V. Sastry , added a nereval at one stage that helped the dancer to go for many more sancharis in her abhinaya , intensifying dance movements . As it progressed into anupallavi and charanas , she dramatised a few scenes from Mahabharata . <p> Sasikala 's sister Nandini entered the stage later and took up Devulapalli Krishna Sastry 's popular number Koluvaitiva Rangasai . She too exhibited some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line Oura Ouroura was indeed a remarkable presentation with jatis , especially the second , was thrilling . <p> Sasikala entered again , performing a Narayana Teertha 's tarangam Pahi Pahimam Paramakripala , preceded by some slokas . Gist of each sloka was well revealed in her abhinaya . Sasikala chose to present the typical Kuchipudi ' Tarangam ' , dancing on the brass plate . The grace was never lost even in brisk forward and backward movements . <p> M. Manjulata gave vocal support to Sastry . K. Rajagopalacharya on mridangam , R. Dinkar on violin , D. Jayakumaracharya on tabla and morsing , Murali on flute and Sudhakar on veena lent support .
