homosexuality : still considered a crime in india  homosexuality : still considered a crime in india  with the age-old section 377 of the indian penal code curtailed , has the attitude of indian society to homosexuals changed ? not much , says shobha warrier , after having spoken to several members of the country 's gay community .  it was during the british rule that section 377 of the indian penal code criminalised consensual sexual acts of adults of the same sex in private , terming it as " against the order of nature " . this law continued till december 2002 when new delhi-based ngo naz india filed a pil challenging the penal code . seven years later , in 2009 , the delhi high court struck down the provision holding that " it violated the fundamental right to life and liberty and the right to equality as guaranteed in the constitution " .  but section 377 continues to apply in the case of sex involving minors and coercive sex .  with the age-old section curtailed , has the attitude of a few high-profile people coming out in the open about their sexuality , the lives of ordinary people who are different in their sexual preference , have not changed a bit . at least that is what those i met said .  their families still do not accept their sexual orientation , to the point of forcing them to marry and lead a bisexual life . society ridicules and humiliates them in such a way that some even contemplate suicide for having been born different .  babu shuffled in his seat and looked suspiciously at the recorder and asked , " will you take my photo while i talk ? " i had to assure him several times that it was only a voice recorder and not a camera . then he looked at the photographer and asked , " will he take my photo when i talk ? " i had to tell him again that we would not take his picture without his permission .  " sorry . i am scared . i do n't want anyone in my family to know that i am a i am leading . i can not even openly say what i want in my life . this is like killing my own identity and living as another person . "  babu is not only afraid of hurting his family but he knows that if he came out openly about his sexual orientation , he would be ostracised by society . so , he lives a life that kills his mind .  ' the kind of torture , humiliation and disgrace i had to go through ... '  from the age of six itself , babu was attracted to men . " i felt shy looking at other boys when young , like a girl , and i got teased badly for that . as i grew , i felt like looking at handsome men , and when i stare at some of them , they either physically abuse me or ridicule me . initially i did n't know why i felt attracted to men . the kind of torture , humiliation and disgrace i had to go through all these years can not be described in words and performed quite well in all the examinations . today , he is doing chartered accountancy after getting a first class masters degree in commerce , and also working and earning rs.35,000 a month .  but is he a happy 25-year-old ?  " no , i can never be happy in my life . i did n't want to be born like this . do you think i would like to be different ? but i am what i am , and what can i do about it ? i do not want to hurt my widowed mother , my sister who is married and my brother . so , i will never tell them that i am gay . i think they suspect i am not normal but we have never had any discussion on the subject . "  babu feels the society in which he lives is such that it will never accept a man who has sex with men . " it is a horrifying thought for the people around me . i will be ostracised if anyone in my family or neighbourhood comes to though employed and earning well , babu contemplates committing suicide when depressed . " i have asked god , ' why was i born like this ? ' i have cried in front of him many times . and it is god that gives me strength to pass each day . i will live for some time to help my family tide over the difficulties and i am sure one day , i will commit suicide .

" i am a bisexual now . i can not say how painful it is to lead such a life . "  he says that there are thousands of people like him in society hurt themselves daily .  " my wife does n't know that i go to men to satisfy my desires . you come to the koovagam festival ( an annual festival of transgenders and transvestites , which takes place in koovagam village in villupuram , tamil nadu ) and you will see thousands of men like me there . "  ( yes , i remembered talking to a few men who were dressed like women in saris with shockingly colourful lipstick , bindi , bangles etc at koovagam . they had told us not to photograph them as they had wives and children at home ! )  it was at the age of 15 that suresh knew he was getting attracted to men . naturally it was followed by self-denial and withdrawal . " i did n't know why i was like this . was it a hormone problem ? even today , i do n't know . as i grew up , i got worried . though it gave me happiness , it worried me that i was having sex with other men . for a long time what i was doing was right or wrong . even today , i do not know whether it is right . "  suresh still can not forget the way he was attacked by some goondas when he was with a man behind the bushes one night . " i still get the shivers when i think of that day . i still carry the scar on my hand . i was attacked with knives and they shouted , ' are you not ashamed of yourself having sex with men ? you are not a human being but an animal . ' and it hurt me badly . "  he says that the only change that has taken place in the last 20 years is that the police do not now clamp criminal cases on them . " but we are treated as criminals by both the police and society . there are 70 places in chennai where men like us go to have sex , and the police are fully aware of these joints . whenever we are spotted , even today the police harass us , scold us they used to tease us in very awful language . it was only because of the campaign against hiv/aids that the police have stopped using such language . "  ' homosexuality is looked at as a disease by many even today '  suresh also says that people like him are abused , both physically and mentally by people in their locality . " when i use the term ' abuse ' , it 's not only verbal . if a man in my locality comes to know about my sexuality , he blackmails people like me by asking for free sex and money . the culture of our society is such that i can not tell them it 's my right to be what i am . even today , this is the condition of gays in indian society . "  according to suresh , in india people from the very rich class and the poor are more accepting about homosexuality than the middle class . in his case also , he had no courage to tell his mother and sister that he was a homosexual and that will never be able to accept it if i tell them the truth . it will also break their hearts . "  suresh is waiting for the day society accepts homosexuals " the way cats , dogs , and birds are also accepted . " today , he says , they face discrimination in families , society and even in hospitals .  " even transgenders have more freedom in this society , but what about us ? why ca n't we also be accepted the way they are accepted ? though there are roughly around one lac homosexuals in tamil nadu alone , how many have the courage to come out in the open and say who they are ? homosexuality is looked at as a disease by many even today , when way back in 1966 itself , who had declared that its not a disease . i blame society for the pain we are going through and not accepting us as we are and categorising homosexuality as a crime , disease and something very wrong .
