" this is a welcome approach , since the established . its dilution may lead to more agitations , as we have repeatedly seen in the past " , says amber dubey , partner and head ( aviation ) at kpmg , a global consultancy firm .  however , the strike seems to go beyond just the pilots ' obduracy .  more than anything else , it is a classic scenario of the complications that may arise due to a failure in troubleshooting a merger of two entities .  sinking story : why air india 's nightmare continues  here is what lies at the heart of the air india problem : even as it had merged with indian airlines in 2005 , the pilots of the two airlines stuck to flying the aircraft attached to their respective airlines - wide-bodied ones used for international legs in the case of air india , and the more short-haul , narrow-bodied ones in the case of indian airlines .  what threw the existing state of affairs into a loop was the entry of the much-hyped ' dreamliners ' -wide-bodied boeing 787s that promised to help turn things around ...  image : the president of boeing india poses in front of the boeing 787 dreamliner.photographs : b mathur/reuters .  sinking story : why air india 's nightmare continues  the match that lit the tinder hot was a proposal to get an equal number of indian airlines pilots and air india ones to fly the twenty-seven planes that air india would take delivery of in the next few years .  yet , not all pilots are made equal , apparently . in indian airlines , it took six years to automatically become a commander .  sinking story : why air india 's nightmare continues  someone in air india who was waiting in the wings for , say , fifteen years to become commander would probably be enraged to see a six-years-in-service , narrow-body aircraft pilot , substantially junior to him , occupy his turf and deny him his long-awaited promotion .  with eight pairs of pilots required for each dreamliner , as many as 432 pilots would have had to be trained once all the 27 planes were delivered .  sinking story : brought most of the erstwhile air india pilots their long-awaited promotions . in fact , air india had hired pilots to handle the increase in the international fleet size , from 23 to around 50 after the induction of the new planes .  industry observers say that the whole problem lies in the very genesis of the union of the two entities .  sinking story : why air india 's nightmare continues  " airlines like air france-klm let the pilots function as separate units under one airline . the fact is that air india 's merger was badly planned and operating it as two separate units under one airline would have solved many of the problems , " an industry insider , who does not want to be identified , says .  if the airline wanted to bring the pilots together under one entity , it could have asked them to choose from among several options that strived for parity .  sinking story : why air india 's nightmare continues  " when british airways was formed after the merger of four airlines , the pilots were given an option to either become commanders on narrow bodies , or to become co-pilots on wide-body planes and then get promoted as commanders , " he says , adding that such a solution would have resolved all conflicts .  apparently , ipg pilots say that this issue - of competing pilots and aircraft type - was to be resolved by the justice dharmadhikari committee .  but air india pushed through a policy in october 2011 under which equal number of pilots of the formerly separate airlines would train for the dreamliner . ipg objected , went to court , and lost .  sinking story : why air india 's nightmare continues  for air india , this impasse can turn out a sizeable blow , that too when the airline is witnessing a large increase in revenues and an improvement in operations .  a substantial part of the airline 's sales - rs 15 crore ( rs 15 million ) of the daily revenues of rs 22 crore ( rs 220 million ) - comes from international operations . this has been hit .  taxpayer . therefore , it is now the government 's urgent responsibility to end the impasse , restore confidence in the airline and its staff and allow it to continue with its recovery before it manages to sink it , once again .
