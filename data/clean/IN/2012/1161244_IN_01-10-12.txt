UN urges protection for elderly as world grays  TOKYO ( AP ) -- The fast aging of Japanese society is evident as soon as one lands at Tokyo 's Narita airport and sees who is doing the cleaning . Young people tend to take such menial jobs in other countries , but here they are often held by workers obviously in the second half-century of their lives .  Having the world 's highest percentage of older people is creating unique challenges for Japan , but a report released Monday by the U.N . Population Fund warns that they will not be unique for long . Japan is the only country with 30 percent of its population over 60 , but by 2050 more than 60 other countries , from China to Canada to Albania , will be in the same boat .  The report urges governments to summon the political will to protect the elderly and ensure they can age with good health and dignity . Discrimination toward and poverty among the aged are still far too prevalent in many countries , it says The problem is worse for women , whose access to jobs and health care is often limited throughout their lives , along with their rights to own and inherit property .  " More must be done to expose , investigate and prevent discrimination , abuse and violence against older persons , especially women who are more vulnerable , " the report says , calling on countries to " ensure that aging is a time of opportunity for all . "  " We need bold political leadership , " said Babatunde Osotimehin , executive director of the Population Fund . " Aging is manageable , but first it must be managed . "  In some countries , such as Latvia and Cyprus , about half of those over 60 are living in poverty . And even in highly industrialized countries such as Japan the elderly struggle to get some services .  Hisako Tsukida , a 77-year-old retired elementary school teacher in Japan 's ancient capital of Kyoto , is living what sounds like a dream retirement life , taking tai chi and flower arrangement lessons and visiting a But her current leisure followed many years of caring for her ailing husband and then for her mother . Japan 's elderly often take on enormous burdens in caring for older relatives at home .  Japan UN Aging  Tsukida spent years trying to find a nursing home for her mother , now 100 , and finally succeeded about six months ago after a rare vacancy opened up . But now she wonders about the time when she 'll have to go through the same struggle for herself .  " I wonder if I could do this again when I 'm even older and need to find myself a place to go , " she said .  The U.N . report said that policy discussions of all kinds must include a consideration of problems facing the aging if mankind is to reap a " longevity benefit " from people 's longer life expectancies .  Governments should build safety nets to ensure older people have income security and access to essential health and social services , it said . The report cited data from the International Labor Organization comprehensive social insurance .  Aging is no longer solely an issue for rich countries . About two-thirds of people over 60 years old live in developing countries such as China , and by 2050 that figure is expected to rise to about 80 percent .  One in nine people -- 810 million -- are 60 or older , a figure projected to rise to one in five -- or more than 2 billion -- by 2050 .  Even Japan , the world 's third-largest economy , offers only meager social benefits , though government-subsidized services provide affordable household help and daycare in some areas .  Neighbors and religious groups often help older people , and public facilities have been vastly improved from a few decades ago , with elevators and other handicapped access now the norm .  The discovery earlier this year , though , that an aged couple and their son apparently had starved to death in their home in a Tokyo suburb highlighted Japan 's own growing problems with poverty and unemployment .  Growing numbers of people suffering from dementia pose another challenge with the disease in 2010 , a number growing about 7.7 million a year and costing about $604 billion worldwide .  Provisions must be made for the infirm to ensure their basic human rights , the U.N . report says .  In many countries , including the United States , India , Brazil and Mexico , statistics show the elderly often pay more into pension systems over their lifetimes than they receive in return . Meanwhile , as retirement ages are raised and benefits cut due to ballooning deficits , the elderly are paying proportionately more in taxes .  The report blamed a bias toward youth in mass media , which stereotype aging as a time of decline , for lowering expectations about life for older people . It noted that older people often live highly productive , enjoyable lives if they have good health and reasonable levels of income .  The report 's authors also argued against a prevalent belief that older workers should make way for younger job seekers , saying that way of thinking is based on the mistaken idea that there is a .  " More jobs for older people do not mean fewer jobs for younger people , " it says .
