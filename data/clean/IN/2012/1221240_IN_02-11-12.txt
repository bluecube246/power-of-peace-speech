<h> Why I love the new James Bond . Hint : Jason Bourne <p> I was 12 years old when I first encountered James Bond , a ripe age for grand pubescent crushes on fictional men . Yet the seemingly irresistible package of sophistication , sexual charisma , and bravado left me cold . Soon after , I picked up Bourne Identity and fell madly in love with another secret agent : Jason Bourne . <p> He was the ultimate anti-Bond . Where one man 's entire identity could be summed up in a single phrase -- " Bond , James Bond " -- the other did n't even know his name . That tormented quest for identity -- packaged in a tough-but-sensitive sexiness -- had an obvious appeal for someone hovering on the edge of adolescent anxiety . <p> My lack of interest in 007 was not mysterious either . By the 1980s , the Bond version of masculinity was already several decades too old . With his tux-and-martinis chivalry and smirking air of superiority , he was a quintessential male fantasy , and an outdated one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both on screen and in the audience . But for my generation of women , say , the Sean Connery version of macho read not as offensive but just silly . This was some Uncleji version of machismo , like in Diamonds Are Forever , when he jokes , " There is something I 'd like you to get off your chest " -- just before he rips off a woman 's bikini top and strangles her with it . Eye roll ! <p> We did n't need have to wait till 1995 for Judi Dench to tell us in Goldeneye that he is " a sexist , misogynist dinosaur . " <p> This film image released by Sony Pictures shows Daniel Craig as James Bond in " Skyfall . " AP <p> Okay , so it was all supposed to be good fun , the characters and plots writ so large as to border on caricature . But what truly grated was the old Bond 's smug infallibility . He possessed no inner life , driven instead by a facile certainty of his rightness and inevitable triumph . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s Amitabh Bachchan playing the angry young man in Deewar or Zanjeer was a far more intriguing and appealing character than any Roger Moore outing . Apples and oranges , perhaps , but the fact remains that the rise of the conflicted modern hero made the original Bond quickly archaic . <p> Old-fashioned sexism aside , world events have not been kind to Bond either . The end of the Cold War spelled an end to the moral certainties , blurring the lines between the good and bad guys . The post-9/11 war on terror outlined the limits of blind patriotism , and being in her majesty 's service no longer seemed like a good idea . Maybe Robert Ludlum was on to something , after all . <p> It 's why history has been kinder to my old crush , the other JB whose movie versions have consistently outperformed the Bond franchise , and by huge margins . It 's why the 21st century James Bond is morphing into his darker twin . The first Jason Bourne movie released in 2002 , which was also the year of the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the Bourne Effect , starting with Casino Royale , the Daniel Craig movies have each tried to blend in Jason-like elements : going rogue , disillusionment , emotional pain , inner torment et al . Skyfall even has Bond disappear , presumed dead , betrayed by his beloved M -- whose moral choices become an issue . But where Bourne turned on his handlers , 007 has to remain true to the establishment . To do otherwise would be to cease to be James Bond . The gadgets have disappeared but the girls remain , but in an oddly obligatory manner . You can almost see Sam Mendes thinking , " Ok , have to do sex with hot chicks . How can I shove them in without making him look like an antiquated jerk ? " <p> Skyfall also does its best to confront the bigger question : Does James Bond matter any more ? The movie is infused with the themes of aging and redundancy . Do we need field agents in an era of technological warfare ? Can " an old dog learn new tricks " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between right and wrong is hard to discern ? <p> The movie 's answer to these questions relies on nostalgic affirmation . When M asks him , " Where are we going ? " Bond replies , " Back in time . " So we jump into his old Aston-Martin and go back to his childhood home where he uses dynamite , a knife and a old hunting gun to defeat the enemy . But in retreating into his past , the movie also rewrites its hero . Bruised , weeping , and stripped of his certainties , the James who emerges from its ashes is also no longer recognisably Bond .
