<h> Win-win in his sails <p> Ravi Mehrotra 's voyage from small-town Kanpur to the heady success of global shipping is an inspiring one for entrepreneurs . <p> Had not fate and ambition willed otherwise , Ravi Mehrotra would have been another executive in a shipping company . But the Chairman of the UK-based Foresight group , a conglomerate with interests in shipping , oil drilling and exploration , hospitality and now branded retail and footwear manufacture , says the burning desire to be a ship owner when he was in his early 40s , made him resign a lucrative job in Iran and sail off to London to test the waters . <p> Now 72 , a spry Mehrotra is waiting in the lobby of the Oberoi in Delhi at the appointed time . The next day is a big one for him as Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit is to release his book followed by a reading by journalist-writer Mark Tully . While the book catalogues Mehrotra 's voyage , from a middle-class family in small-town Kanpur to the top rung of the shipping world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs , including a ten-step guide which he calls Ravi 's Formula . <p> As Tully writes in the foreword to the book , " He started as a naughty marine engineering cadet , was rusticated for ragging , went to sea and came ashore at a comparatively young age to have an adventurous corporate career in shipping . That included hazardous years in Iran before and after the Revolution . " <h> Buying tea for Iran <p> Over dinner , where Mehrotra orders for us some minestrone soup and a bottle of Grover red wine , with grilled red snappers to follow , I ask about his tumultuous years in Iran . There 's a twinkle in his eyes as he recalls his posting with the Shipping Corporation of India to work in Irano Hind Shipping Co , a joint venture set up to export iron ore from Kudremukh to Iran . The project , he says , was delayed by two years and Irano Hind had to find things to do to stay afloat . On his initiative , the shipping company became a trader , importing tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks of the company , the Iranian revolution resulted in a regime change with the Shah deposed . He chose to stay on though times were tense and risky , he recalls . " I sent my children off to India to continue their education . " But , as happenstance would have it , the Iranian government wanted an advisor on shipping . With permission from New Delhi , Mehrotra , then in his late 30s , was appointed principal advisor on shipping to the Islamic Republic of Iran . " I also found from my few meetings with Ayatollah Khomeini that he recognised the importance of shipping to ensure the continuous inflow of petro dollars , " he says . <h> For the love of a ship ... <p> But he was restless ; " I did n't see light at the end of the tunnel . If the job of Advisor had come to me when I was 50-plus , I would have been happy , but I was 42 . I could not see myself in the same job for the next 20 years . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not become a ship owner , which I wanted to before I retired . My wife said I was mad . But I told her to give me two years to try and , if I failed , I could get a job . At least I would have no regrets . " <p> So , in 1984 , he quit SCI and moved to London . Why the UK , I ask , and not back home ? " Well , " he says candidly , " In India I would have been a failure . I had risen quite well and was earning well . But that did n't mean I could start a shipping company when a ship cost $10 million . " So , London it was , where finance was more readily available . <p> Involved in ship broking , the initial years for the Foresight Group were tough . But his connections with Iran provided the turning point . A risky assignment , he recalls , to evacuate oil from Iran during the war years with Iraq helped the company earn its spurs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in the mid-1980s , that Foresight bought its first VLCC ( very large crude carrier ) . <p> But buying his first ship was n't easy . " I bought the ship in 1985 for $2 million in an auction from the Spanish Government , which was selling it due to a recession . Then we invested another $2.5 million to refurbish it . This was funded by a German bank , which gave us 75 per cent of the money , and the rest was financed from our own earnings . We sold that ship for $5 million within six years . That is how the group built its equity , " he explains . <h> Drilling for oil <p> His exposure to oil trading during the Iran-Iraq war got him to diversify into drilling . Refrigerated ships followed . At the peak , Foresight owned 25 rigs and ships . Today , the group is more into oil drilling , deploying rigs in the Arabian Gulf and Iran . Three more rigs , being built in China , are on way . Along with his hospitality arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says . <p> His entry into hospitality was also happenstance , he recalls . At a shipping conference in Shanghai , a chance encounter with the Mayor turned up an invitation to start an Indian restaurant . He did , following up with five more across China , all called The Tandoor . He also owns a Chinese restaurant in Delhi . <h> Sailing in rough seas <p> But it has n't been roses all the way . The late 1990s turned quite tough for him . Heavily invested in the reefer ( refrigerated ships ) business , Foresight had raised a huge sum in the American bond market . With the shipping industry going through its cyclical downturn , the group was hard put to pay interest on the bonds . Amer Reefer , a group company , went through protracted turmoil for a few years till 2002 , when it emerged from US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after it completed restructuring its bond issue . <p> " In hindsight , this was a miscalculation on my part , for in my eagerness to regain my worldwide standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative bulk carrier business , which boomed shortly after we had invested in reefers , " he explains . <h> India connect <p> A group company , Hallworthy Shipping , is part of a consortium led by GAIL prospecting for oil in Rajasthan . Foresight has invested about $10 million . But hitting the headlines is the Pavers Foresight Venture 's application for a $20-million investment as 100 per cent FDI in single brand retail . <p> Mehrotra is emphatic that the 30 per cent local sourcing clause is important for India . " How will jobs be created in India if they do n't insist on that ? " he asks . The Pavers England brand , which retails footwear in India , already sources 40 per cent of its requirement from India , so that 's not a worry for the group . <p> He says that despite all his years abroad , he has kept India ties strong . He 's been awarded a CBE ( Commander of the Order of the British Empire ) by the Queen for his services to shipping . What empire , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seas through which Britain created its empire .
