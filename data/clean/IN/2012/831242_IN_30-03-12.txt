<p> Mahesh Vijapurkar likes to take a worm 's eye-view of issues -- that is , from the common man 's perspective . He was a journalist with The Indian Express and then The Hindu and now potters around with human development and urban issues . <h> Custodial deaths : Human Rights on the backburner in Maharashtra <p> Recall the movie , The Omen , starring Gregory Peck ? In it , so much revolves around 666 , the number of the beast , the anti-Christ , of evil . Personified as a young boy , evil had to be killed . There was much drama to it . <p> Triple 6 is also the number of cases of another earthly evil -- custodial deaths in Maharashtra -- according to the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission ( MSHRC ) website -- and pending at the end of March 2011 . More importantly , as many as 506 cases of custodial deaths , a gross human rights violation , are pending since 2001 . <p> The statistics of course are stale , since they are computed on an 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be up soon after 31 March , just two days away . Do n't expect them to be updated a few days thence either , for these things take time . <p> A dysfunctional , or in this case , non-functional Commission , is a disrespect to the very purpose of upholding human rights . Representational image . AFP Photo <p> As if the issue itself is not bad enough , the MSHRC finds itself in a limbo : two of its members have retired and replacements have yet to be found . The chairperson quit a few weeks ago and there is no indication of a quick replacement . That is why there is no action in the MSHRC right now , leave alone any dramatics . Neither is there a sense of urgency in filling up the vacancies . <p> So what do the few officers who remain , do ? They carry out research , not an insignificant activity , but not incredibly important to a functional Commission . They operate in the Commission 's office , a single-storeyed , asbestos-roofed building near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has a comforting anonymity . <p> Since 2001 , numerous complaints of custodial deaths have been brought before the MSHRC each year , the lowest being 87 in the first year , going up to 250 in later years . That is a poor index of police attitude towards the citizens . <p> We do n't know the trend in the year that is concluding , yet , but according to unnamed officials quoted by the Indian Express on Thursday , nearly 70 percent of the cases brought to the MSHRC are of this nature . <p> The first crisis came when Kshitij Vyas , a former High Court Chief Justice , quit suddenly and moved back to Gujarat . Then came two quick retirements , one of TS Singarvel , and another of retired justice VG Munshi . <p> There are two ways in which vacancies arise : one by sudden resignations , which adversely impact the Commission ; and the other by retirements , which are foretold . But the Maharashtra Government did not foresee the retirements . It waited till the officers retired and then sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a nod . <p> The choice of chairperson is yet to be made . According to the Indian Express , the panel -- that picks the chairperson -- comprising the chief minister , home minister , speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the Leader of the Opposition , has n't been able to find a successor . The wait could be long as the selection process is laborious , unless a miracle happens . <p> A dysfunctional , or in this case , non-functional Commission , is a disrespect to the very purpose of upholding human rights . You can not have about 30 people streaming in , complaint in hand , seeking redress against the highhandedness of the state or its instruments , only to be turned away . It is their only grievance redress mechanism . That itself could be a violation ? Perhaps it is . <p> If things worked according to law and humans got the basic minimum respect because of them , then the Commission would not have been required at all . But given the number of complaints against the Maharashtra police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Commission 's raison d'etre is in the number of cases brought before it : 45,769 since its inception till end-March 2011 . Of course , 28,220 cases , that is more than half , were dismissed at the threshold itself . But that does not mean all complaints are frivolous .
