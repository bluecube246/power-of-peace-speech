<h> Now , a repellent spray to minimise man-animal conflict <p> After struggling for decades , relief came their way when Gobichettipalayam-based Provimi Products introduced Herboliv+ , a plant growth promoter and wild animal repellent spray to solve the man-animal conflict . <p> G.V. Sudarshan , Director of Provimi says the formula helps control intrusion of wild animals into agricultural fields and also aids crop growth . The Forest College and Research Institute at Mettupalayam is testing the product . <p> Business Line , meanwhile , spoke to a couple of farmers who have been using this spray for about a month now . <p> Velusamy , a small farmer , residing at Mundirimudaku , Odanthurai Panchayat in Mettupalayam says not a day passes without intrusion of some animal or the other into his field . Velusamy 's farm is located just about 1,500 feet away from the Ooty hills . " It is very close to the forest . I have been living and cultivating banana in this 2.5 acre plot for more than 8 years now . Intrusion of animals such as deer , bison and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They just stray from the forest anytime of the day and pull out the plantlet . We use sticks , beat drums to ward them off . The area is fenced by electric lines to ensure that these animals do not invade the cultivated area . We have to keep a watch though as they tend to break such barriers easily , " says Velusamy <p> His observation of the elephants ' routine was more interesting . " Elephants cross this stretch anywhere between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. and retrace their way back into the forest between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m . If they cross the electric fence and enter the farm , there 's no way one can save the crop . They will attack and destroy tens of hundreds of plants within minutes . They usually invade the field only when the plant is five-six months old or is nearing the flowering stage . The sound of drums , crackers and the sight of fire keep them off the field . Interestingly , elephants follow the same path . " <p> When asked how he manages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has engaged two security guards . " We do not get agriculture labourers here and the cost of engaging security guards is even more expensive . I pay Rs 500/day , for keeping a watch on elephants , and such guards are difficult to come by these days , " adds Velu . <h> Labour shortage <p> Nagaraj , who lives about 2 km away from the foothills at Jallimedu , cultivates vegetables . " It 's not easy . There is a huge shortage of agriculture labour in this part and we have to protect our farmlands from animal intrusion as well . Many of them have given their land on lease or sold and moved out , ' said this farmer . <p> " Intrusion of monkeys is very high here , " says Srinivasan , a farmer in Kalar . <p> These farmers and a few others feel that this product should help them keep the wild animals at bay . " It is not poisonous . The strong odour keeps them off . For now , this seems a best remedy .. After years of struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Srinivasan
