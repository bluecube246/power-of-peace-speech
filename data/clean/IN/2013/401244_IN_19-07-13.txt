Remainder books , the unsold editions of books from Indian and international publishers , are in huge demand  There are books on tables , books in cartons and books on the floor . They come in every size , shape and colour ; hard-bound , paper-backed and leather-wrapped . Some with cracking spines and others with yellowing pages , and still others spanking new . The walls around stand unadorned and there 's no air-conditioned comfort ; no cozy cafeteria on the side nor sofas to sink into .  What there is though , are books by the lakhs -- mostly unsold editions from Indian and international publishers -- stretching across all genres and sold at generous discounts . Kochi hosts two such year-round book sales -- Blossoms on Press Club Road and Kerala Book House on Chittoor Road .  Reselling in bulk  " When books grow old or remain unsold for long at bookstores , they are sent back to publishers and distributors , who resell them in bulk to the unorganised book market . Of the English books market in Kerala explains Abdul Latheef who has run Blossoms for the last seven years . With Indian publishers , their leftovers can be bought at Daryaganj in Delhi , where most have their headquarters , while international publishers ship their books by the container to port cities such as Mumbai or Chennai , says K.M. Basheer who owns Kerala Book House .  Many book store owners in Kerala are veering toward this market because there 's a rich supply , and maintenance overheads are few says Basheer . " It 's difficult to sustain a bookshop these days because people buy brand new books at lower prices on online portals which even home deliver , " he says . Thus the biggest advantage remainder-book sales have is their discounted prices . " We only need to cover transportation costs and the price paid to the publisher . So we are able to offer up to 70 per cent discount on old editions and up to 20 per cent even on recently-published books . People come to us because they know they can find a decent quality of books and a wide variety One of the challenges such sales face is display space says Basheer . Since books are bought and sold in bulk , there 's a massive stock with the owner always , and exhibiting it requires large halls . Besides his permanent space on Chittoor Road , he once had a branch on Warriam Road which he had to close down due to high rent . " Nowadays , I take places on lease for a few weeks at a time , display over five lakh books at once and then move to another venue , " he says . He is currently hosted at a hall beside Kalyan Silks . The other difficulty is in procuring manpower observes Latheef . " We need people who are familiar with books , can sort them into the right genres and can pick out the right book in the right edition when customers enquire , " says Latheef .  The upside to the business of unsold books is the wide variety possible since the focus is n't only on latest releases . It 's therefore common to find four or five editions to the latest , often with a cover featuring the book 's movie version . While Basheer stocks his books in piles by price , ranging upwards from Rs. 20 per book , Blossoms categorises them by genre . There 's everything from literary fiction to commercial fiction , travel , art , film , photography , academic discourse , biography , comics and children 's books . " Our popular sections are the art and cinema ones because there are many international works here which otherwise would be unavailable at stores or exorbitantly priced , " says Latheef . Running a book sale needs one to be clued in to the current trends in the market ; latest works by authors and new editions released by publishers says Latheef . " I keep updated constantly and I stock according to customer requests , " he adds .  His clientele are primarily youth shopping on a budget or professionals and technicians in the film and photography fields looking to update their skills . There are also many book collectors searching for rare or first editions , as well as those nor Basheer stock textbooks though , but both supply fiction and nonfiction to school and private libraries , as well as coffee shops and cafes .  Both sales also function as lending-libraries of a sort since they buy back their books at 50 per cent the price sold . " That way , readers can take however long they 'd like with a book , without paying fines for overshooting due-dates . Their ' reading cost ' is hence lower , " says Latheef . He adds , " For a small city like Kochi , the size of the reading population is at par with large metros . It 's that that keeps us going .
