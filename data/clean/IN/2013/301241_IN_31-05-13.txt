cubiclenama coping with randomness  economists , politicians , diplomats and religious leaders all function with unstinting faith in their own models of the universe . photo : thinkstock  take all the human innovation and invention and ingenuity from the dawn of time right up till five minutes ago . take every tool , every device , every technique and every technology . from the first pointed stick ever picked up the from the ground by a caveman , to the latest tesla electric car . what is the driving force behind these developments ?  now this is not an original idea . i do n't exactly recall where i read this for the first time . but i think it was in one of j.m. roberts ' excellent single-volume histories of the world . in it he suggests that the human strivings that lead to epochal inventions such as agriculture , electricity or the internet are motivated not , as you might expect , by visions of a better life , or longevity or convenience .  instead , roberts suggests , they are single-minded human determination to reduce the randomness in our existence .  for instance , the life of the hunter-gatherer is of utmost unpredictability . who knows when a goat will offer itself for hunting , or a coconut palm for gathering ? or both for some appam stew . agriculture brought stability and predictability to their food supplies .  similarly , ancient mariners developed navigation so that they could actually reach somewhere . and not flounder about on some strange jungle shore with no baggage and no food . ( though air france is working very hard at returning us to those beastly days . )  and thus human beings , over the ages , have tried to constantly increase the predictability of every sphere of homo sapien activity from manufacturing and medicine to meteorology and short-format cricketing tournaments .  but what does all this have to with office culture and cubicle life ? or have i simply been wasting the last three minutes of your glorious saturday morning ?  earlier this month , consumer goods company procter and gamble ( p&amp;g ) announced that it to run the company . in 2009 , lafley stepped down after handing over the control room to bob mcdonald , a hand-picked successor . at the time the transfer was referred to as a text-book case of transition management .  lafley was said to have not only picked a successor , but also left behind an internal system at p&amp;g to pick and groom leaders for the future . lafley , it appeared , had left the company future-proof .  now lafley is back and there are already reports of a new restructuring at p&amp;g that will turn around the company and help identify a better successor .  for p&amp;g 's sake i hope it works .  but the story exposes some of the modern workplace 's misplaced insouciance that it can manage all randomness .  business schools , business textbooks and business gurus all give us the impression that most , if not every , element of the workplace and business can be reduced to deterministic rules . follow the rules , execute the prescribed actions , and you will get your desired outcomes , that the human beings involved become irrelevant .  this is fine so far as the models are extended to mathematical things such as simple banking , supply chains , information systems and so on .  but extend this thinking to concepts such as " leadership " and suddenly you 're tap-dancing on razor-thin ice .  to me the very idea of a " leadership grooming system " is ridiculous . it seems a wishful , futile attempt to mitigate all kinds of inestimably random things . it is also a reflection of the modern organization 's insistence that the process is superior to the person . apple is greater than steve jobs . virgin is greater than richard branson . amazon is greater than jeff bezos .  but what if they are n't ? what if p&amp;g can never replace lafley ? what if there is simply no way of using all your confounded obsession with controlling randomness to cleave the leader from the legions ?  and even if your leadership grooming programme does throw up some brilliant young managers , what about the external with winston churchill , what if you appoint a great peace-time ceo for a brutal war-time scenario ?  but there are other randomness-es besides leadership as well . the back-alleys of marketing are littered with dead brands that got great focus group feedback . and yet managers continue to obsess over these tools that give them the sense that human emotional response can be " managed " .  of course , this obsession extends to all spheres of life . economists , politicians , diplomats and religious leaders all function with unstinting faith in their own models of the universe .  the general public is little better . each generation likes to think that it has tamed randomness a little better than the previous one . and then something falls apart .  cubiclenama takes a weekly look at pleasures and perils of corporate life . your comments are welcome at cubiclenama@livemint.com . to read sidin vadukut 's previous columns , go to **28;577;toolong
