<h> Hydro projects causing degeneration of hill ecology : CAG <p> Shimla : The hydropower projects in Himachal Pradesh -- in private and public sectors -- are not only gobbling up forests but also damaging natural resources , the Comptroller and Auditor General of India ( CAG ) has found . <p> The compensatory afforestation by the state is highly deficient as 58 percent of the test-checked hydropower projects reported no afforestation at all , the CAG said in its recent report . <p> It pointed out that lack of re-greening of hills poses severe hazards both to natural ecology and stabilisation of hill slopes . <p> A total of 559 run-of-river hydro projects with an aggregate generation capacity of 10,131 MW were allotted to independent power producers from November 1991 to January 2012 . <p> Till March last year , says the CAG , 55 projects have been commissioned and the remaining are under execution . <p> An audit found that 12 companies have deposited the funds for compensatory afforestation , but it was not carried out at all in seven projects . <p> " Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in three projects it was between 64 and 81 percent , " it said . <p> The plantation survival in Barseu and Manglad projects was 90 and 100 percent , whereas it was between 40 and 60 percent in the Malana-I , Luni-II and Upper Awa projects . <p> The Malana-I project , which has already been commissioned , had acquired 61 hectares of forest area in Kullu district for the project . <p> " The company got clearance to axe 990 trees . As compensatory afforestation , the government was supposed to plant 529,000 saplings ( on behalf of the company ) but only 336,500 were planted , " it said . <p> The company had deposited Rs.143.37 lakh with the government for compensatory afforestation in November 1998 . <p> The plantation , said the CAG , was highly deficient , posing severe hazards both for natural ecology and stabilisation of hill slopes . <p> It also found that one power producer -- Manjhal in Chamba district -- out of the 16 operational projects selected for test-check was not ensuring minimum flow of water downstream . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure minimum flow of 15 percent water downstream throughout the year , including the lean season , from November to March , for survival of aquatic flora and fauna and riparian rights . <p> According to the CAG , in three -- Manjhal , Sarbari-II and Tarella-III -- commissioned projects there was no provision of real-time continuous water outflow measurement , which is mandatory as per the government 's hydropower policy . <p> The CAG asked the government to ensure that hydropower projects do not result in an adverse impact on the environment . <p> According to forest department estimates , over 9,000 hectares of forest land have so far been diverted to non-forest use . Of this , 7,000 hectares were used for hydel projects . <p> Environmentalist R.S. Negi , who heads the Him Lok Jagriti Manch , a people 's movement against upcoming hydro projects in Kinnaur district , told : " The hydro projects are destructive not only to the rivers but also to traditional water channels . " <p> " Before allocating any new project in the entire Himalayan region that falls in seismic zone-IV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying capacity and cumulative impact assessment of the projects , " he said . <h> You may also like <h> 2 Comments <p> It is still a high time for us to rethink on our policy on hydro power exploitation in Himachal.Blind following is always a worst . Hence in the best interest of state and its environment , stoppage is the requirement of time . It is also a fact that we have completely failed in re-plantation drive , what soever figure , we may put forward . <p> The Cag report makes precisely the same points and voices the same concerns/ recommendations that were made in the Shukla Committee report submitted to the HP High Court in June 2010 . The state govt. had , under pressure from the hydro-power lobby , predictably opposed the findings of the report , but it appears that the matter has made no headway ( towards implementation ) even in the High Court.The Central govt. too is sleeping over it . We are running out of time . Is it time to file another PIL on the basis of the CAG report this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the Centre and the State ?
