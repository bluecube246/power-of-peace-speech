" <p> According to managing director of Haikor Security Agencies , K S Rao , " Some of the private security agencies had even undergone training at AP Police Academy in Hyderabad , but are yet to get the government nod . " <p> While the Private Security Agency ( Regulation ) Act 2005 was passed by Parliament , the state assembly enacted the AP Private Security Agency ( Regulation ) Rules in 2008 , following which private security agencies have to obtain licences from the AP special secretary , home , who is the controlling authority for dealing with private security agencies and issuing licences . <p> However , sources say that the stakeholders were not consulted when the regulations were passed , leading to a plethora of problems for security agencies . <p> " There were some modifications and changes that were needed and APPSA had regularly met with government authorities and we were awaiting necessary changes in the rules , " he said , explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verification of credentials of the private security personnel and the owners . <p> With the Telangana issue surfacing , the amendments were put on hold , sources said .
