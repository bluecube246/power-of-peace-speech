you are here  indian airpower afloat  the first indigenously designed and built aircraft carrier , ins vikrant , was launched on august 12 , 2013 . while still several years from being operational , the launch of the carrier , which has been designed to carry 36 fixed wing fighter aircrafts , comprising a mix of mig-29k and the indigenous lca ( naval variants ) in addition to ka-31 aew and alh helicopters , will provide air cover to indian navy ( in ) vessels . the launching of the hull of ins vikrant with the power plant and generators integrated is the first step in the further development of the ship , particularly the weapon systems . this work is likely to consume the better part of two years before the ship can join the operational fleet . only the uk , the us , france , and russia have demonstrated the ability to design and build such ships . reportedly , the second indigenous aircraft carrier ( iac-2 ) is under design already .  one particular feature of the aircraft carrier is like the us super carriers , for the launch of the fixed wing aircraft . instead , the bow of the ship sports a ski-jump configuration , in which the aircraft rolling down the very short available runway on take off is lofted into the air like a skier.1 this will impose limitations on the type of aircraft operable . the iac-2 is likely to have catapults for aircraft launch .  the importance of air power at sea can not be overstated especially since the battle of coral sea ( may 4 -- 8 , 1942 ) , in which two opposing fleets fought a major sea battle through the use of aircrafts launched from their carriers . replacement of the battleship of yore with aircraft carriers , as the new capital ship , has been a strategic choice for the navies of the world since then .  ins viraat , currently the sole indian aircraft carrier , operates british-made sea harrier2 fighters in addition to helicopters of various types . ins vikrant 's mig-29k fighters are modern fourth generation fighters that will provide the in with state-of-the-art air ( bvr ) as well as within visual range ( wvr ) missiles backed by advanced airborne radar and infra-red search and track ( irst ) systems and excellent agility . the mig-29k also has an anti-ship and anti-land target strike capability , which would help in vastly increasing the reach , safety and lethality of the fleets at sea .  the in has fielded an aircraft carrier since 1961.3 the original ins vikrant served from 1961 to 1997.4 aspiring to field at least two carrier battle groups ( cbgs ) , one each for the western and eastern seaboards , the in negotiated for induction of the erstwhile soviet carrier , the deactivated admiral gorshkov , while also commencing to design an indigenous aircraft carrier . the contract for its transfer of admiral gorshkov involved extensive refurbishment by russia . the refurbishment has faced extensive delays and cost escalations , though the vessel is reportedly now nearing readiness .  the progress in the development of ins vikrant indicates that india 's shipbuilding capabilities are maturing towards self-reliance in design and development of high-end naval vessels . at the nuclear powered submarine are complex . by 2020 , ins vikrant should be ready for operational deployment and could be reasonably be expected to be joined in a few years by its sister ships that may include further refinements over the original design . both ins vikramaditya and ins vikrant are expected to carry mig-29k fighters , sourced from russia , to be joined later by hindustan aeronautics limited 's ( hal 's ) tejas ( naval variant ) .  by the 2030s , the in should be able to field three cbgs giving it the capability to protect india 's interests at locations far removed from the coast . the increasingly " designed and made in india " nature of the in 's fleets should provide strategic and tactical flexibility through total ownership of critical technologies and capabilities . air power afloat as an integral part of the indian naval fleets should provide these vessels assured air defence and fire power against surface targets at sea and on land .  the in has long aspired for a true blue water capability and the aircraft carrier project is a in the project from the design stage onwards at the cochin shipyard thus giving it total ownership . also , the time and cost overruns in the indigenous aircraft carrier project are relatively minor . the admiral gorshkov 's refurbishment by russian shipyards , with several decades of experience , stands as a comparison.5 the ins vikrant is the lead ship of its class and future vessels of the same type , if built , should benefit from the from the construction process .  india has major maritime interests . these arise from the fact that most of india 's foreign trade is carried by sea . india 's energy imports also come by sea . therefore , it is important for the country to be able to provide security along these sea lanes of communication ( slsoc ) . moreover , with an expanding economy , india requires to be able to access raw materials sourced from other countries along the indian ocean rim as well as further away . thus india must be able to freely access the slsoc to these regions . the indian ocean hosts some and the straits of malacca . in international waters it is critical to have capabilities to protect national assets , particularly the sea passage choke points .  naval fleets have the ability to stay on station for long and carry considerable integral firepower . an aircraft carrier bolsters the potency of naval fleets by deploying fighter aircrafts that can apply long distance power from their carrier . carriers can provide intelligence , reconnaissance and other essential support functions as well . a carrier battle group thus enhances the power projection capability of its fleet manifold .  the ins vikrant signifies the coming of age of india 's ability to design and build major warships in the country and much to cheer for the indigenous defence industry . moreover , it indicates that the in is close to achieving capabilities to field forces at long distances in order to safeguard india 's maritime interests .  views expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the idsa or of the government of india .  1 . the upwards momentum imparted to the aircraft as very short available runway and , therefore , sub-optimal achieved speed due to the short take off run . the short take off run would result in lower speed than required for take off . however , the ski jump lofts the aircraft upwards ; the additional height so gained allows the aircraft to build up adequate speed for a safe climb out .  2 . the sea harrier is an excellent aircraft with vertical landing and take off capability . however , its unique design restricts its radius of action , especially in vertical take off mode . moreover , it was designed in the late 1950s and 1960s . hence , its design has imitations in performance compared with modern fighters of later design .  3 . india bought the under-construction hms herculese majestic class aircraft carrier from uk in 1957 . upon its completion in 1961 , it was commissioned into the in as ins vikrant .  4 . ins vikrant , which had commenced being built in 1943 and was finally completed in 1961 , came to be decommissioned in 1997 . in bought ins viraat to replace the first ins vikrant . the viraat also boasts a ski jump configuration and came equipped to operate the sea harrier fighters in addition to helicopters .  5 . initially , the admiral gorshkov was to be given free to india with india paying $800 million for its refurbishment and another $1 billion for mig-29 fighters and other equipment . the final cost is in the range of $2.33 billion . initial entry into service date was to be october 2008 with delivery finally delayed to october 2013.
