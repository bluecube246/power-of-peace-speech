<h> SmartPorn : India 's other mobile revolution <p> That smut flood is sparking a serious debate about the impact on society . <p> " We 're raising up an army of rapists in India by not warring against internet pornography , " Abishek Clifford , who runs a moral awareness program for Indian colleges called Rescue , told GlobalPost . <p> He 's not the only one concerned . <p> Since the December gang rape of a Delhi student , who died from internal injuries sustained during the attack , the entire country has been wrestling with what many regard as a spike in sexual violence . <p> Although possessing or watching porn is permitted in India , distributing it is illegal . And now , the authorities are moving to crack down on web porn -- even as in many other areas the country grows more liberal in its attitude toward sex . <p> Flood of free porn <p> Ancient India had no qualms about graphic depictions of sex . Consider the luxurious illustrations of the Kama Sutra , or the carvings on the 1,000-year-old temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But , until recently , modern India has been decidedly more prudish . <p> In the ' 80s and ' 90s , films with lascivious dialogue and a few shots of buxom women in wet saris were considered softcore porn . Bollywood did n't even dare show kissing until a few years back . And the country 's first " real " porn star was a cartoon . <p> Now , suddenly , affordable smartphones have put hardcore porn in the palms of millions . <p> According to statistics from Manwin Holding , the Luxembourg-based owner of the world 's largest free porn sites , YouPorn and Pornhub , India 's 150 million-odd internet users visit those two sites alone at a clip of around 2 million hits per day . The presence of Indian-themed content ( " naked desi babes in bath " is one of the few printable titles ) and advertisements confirms that the multibillion dollar industry has taken note . <p> Meanwhile , reported incidents of rape have nearly doubled since 1995 , when the internet first came to India , according to the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiked 12 percent since cheap smart phones hit the market two years ago , although it 's impossible to parse how much of that increase stems from the greater willingness of victims to come forward . <p> To some , that correlation signals causality . <p> " Pornography is en masse perverting the lifestyles and behaviors of young people in India , " said Rescue 's Clifford , citing Rescue surveys in which college students confessed that each week they watch an average of two hours of " violent porn . " <p> More porn , more rape ? <p> The media and the authorities , too , have been quick to draw a connection between the increased availability of pornography and the apparent increase in sexual violence . <p> A recent article in India Today , a leading weekly magazine , drew attention to the prevalence of rape fantasy porn and other violent clips at local " download centers " -- kiosks where entrepreneurs illegally load porn onto customers ' thumb drives and memory chips . And it cited Google AdWords statistics to point out that " Mobile phones were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search with the keyword ' rape ' over the past year " and " search keywords included ' Indian girls raped ' , ' raping video ' , ' raping stories ' , ' raped in public ' , ' little girl raped ' , ' raping mom ' , ' father raping daughter ' and ' raped to death ' . " <p> In June , the department of telecommunications banned 39 websites , all hosted abroad , that allow users to share pornographic content . <p> And this month , a parliamentary committee was formed to explore ways to block internet pornography altogether in response to the latest of many petitions that have demanded a blanket ban . <p> But is the flood of smut really to blame for an epidemic of violent gang rapes ? <p> If so , India may not exactly be an outlier . <p> The country 's 4.1 million monthly searches for the keyword " rape " amounts to one search per month for every 30 internet users . In comparison , US mobile users also searched for " rape " an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key phrases like " women getting raped , " " men being raped " and " kids being raped . " That 's one search per month per 60 internet users . <p> For both countries , those figures include not only the apparently heinous phrases highlighted by India Today , but also every search for rape counseling , rape news reports , rape crisis centers and so on . In India 's case , for instance , there were an average of around 100,000 searches for " raping video " ( or one search per month for every 1500 internet users ) . The average was 246,000 searches for " Delhi gang rape " and 90,500 for " rape victims . " <p> Incidentally , Google indicates that it removes suspected " commercial " and child pornography from its products , and reports criminal activity to the authorities . A quick search suggests the rape-related search terms do n't return graphic pictures and videos -- although a disturbing proportion of the YouTube results for " rape " are clips from mainstream Indian movies . <p> After years of debate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at odds over whether pornography turns men into rapists . Bangalore-based neuroscientist Sai Gaddam , co-author of " A Billion Wicked Thoughts , " argues that there is precious little data to support most of the claims about the disastrous impact of ubiquitous web porn . <p> " We found that they 're inversely correlated , " Gaddam told GlobalPost . " The more easily available pornography is , the less the incidence of sexual crimes . "
