<h> News You Can Use 24 genes enhance the risk of myopia <p> An unfavourable combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors appears to be particularly risky for the development of myopia . <p> Scientists have identified 24 new genes that cause myopia or short-sightedness , a breakthrough that could lead to drugs for prevention of the eye condition from which 80% of Asians suffer . <p> Myopia is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide , and currently there is no cure , according to a study published in the journal Nature Genetics . The study was led by professor Chris Hammond from the department of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King 's College London . Researchers analysed the genetic and refractive error data of over 45,000 people from 32 different studies . The new genes include those which function in brain and eye tissue signalling , the structure of the eye , and eye development . It was already known that environmental factors , such as reading , lack of outdoor exposure , and a higher level of education can increase the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental factors appears to be particularly risky for the development of myopia . <p> " This study reveals for the first time a group of new genes that are associated with myopia and that carriers of some of these genes have a tenfold increased risk of developing the condition , " Prof. Hammond said in a statement .
