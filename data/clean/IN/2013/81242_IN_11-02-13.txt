news you can use 24 genes enhance the risk of myopia  an unfavourable combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors appears to be particularly risky for the development of myopia .  scientists have identified 24 new genes that cause myopia or short-sightedness , a breakthrough that could lead to drugs for prevention of the eye condition from which 80% of asians suffer .  myopia is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide , and currently there is no cure , according to a study published in the journal nature genetics . the study was led by professor chris hammond from the department of twin research and genetic epidemiology at king 's college london . researchers analysed the genetic and refractive error data of over 45,000 people from 32 different studies . the new genes include those which function in brain and eye tissue signalling , the structure of the eye , and eye development . it was already known that environmental factors , such as reading , lack of outdoor exposure , and a higher level of education can increase the risk environmental factors appears to be particularly risky for the development of myopia .  " this study reveals for the first time a group of new genes that are associated with myopia and that carriers of some of these genes have a tenfold increased risk of developing the condition , " prof. hammond said in a statement .
