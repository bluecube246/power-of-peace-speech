He did n't say yes or no to the person , " said Usha . <p> However , the athlete from Kerala said the time is yet to come to make a film on her . <p> " The film on Milkha Singh released at the right time . A film on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am still into athletics , " she said . <p> Indicating her aim to produce a medal winner in the Olympics and pinning her hope on K D Sindhu to do the wonders which she failed in 1984 Los Angeles Olympics , Usha said she liked " Bhaag Milkha Bhaag " directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra . <p> " I have watched the film . It is good and youngsters will definitely be motivated watching this , " she added . <p> The movie showed Milkha ( essayed by Farhan Akhtar ) missing a medal for glancing over his shoulders to see who was catching him up . <p> Usha said she failed to clinch a medal in the 1984 Olympics as she did not know that a runner should lunge forward while breasting the tape . <p> " I lost because I did n't bend at the finishing line . It was due to lack of experience and exposure at the international level , " she added . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .
