" Somebody approached my husband to do a film based on my life and career . He did n't say yes or no to the person , " said Usha .  However , the athlete from Kerala said the time is yet to come to make a film on her .  " The film on Milkha Singh released at the right time . A film on my am still into athletics , " she said .  Indicating her aim to produce a medal winner in the Olympics and pinning her hope on K D Sindhu to do the wonders which she failed in 1984 Los Angeles Olympics , Usha said she liked " Bhaag Milkha Bhaag " directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra .  " I have watched the film . It is good and youngsters will definitely be motivated watching this , " she added .  The movie showed Milkha ( essayed by Farhan Akhtar ) missing a medal for glancing over his shoulders to see who was catching him up .  Usha said she failed to clinch a medal in the 1984 Olympics as she did not know that a runner should lunge forward while breasting the tape .  " I lost because I did n't bend at the finishing line . It was due to lack of experience and exposure at the international level , " she added .
