<p> MUMBAI : Seven leading IITs , Infosys , TCS , Cognizant and industry lobby Nasscom are coming together to launch a bunch of free , online courses that could potentially help 100,000-150,000 people a year get high-quality education and make them job-ready . <p> The courses will be offered using the model of massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) , which is globally creating an upheaval in the world of higher education . The first three courses in computer science are expected to roll out this October . <p> " This programme is particularly relevant to India because of the high number of young students who need to be educated and trained , " says Lakshmi Narayanan , vice-chairman of Cognizant . <p> MOOCs make high-quality education from top universities accessible to anyone , anywhere in the world , online and for free . <p> The model was rolled out in early 2012 back-to-back by two start-ups , Udacity and Coursera , both emerging out of Stanford University . This was followed by edX , MIT-Harvard 's online courses platform . <p> About 15 faculty members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently designing the course . <p> " We are currently working out the details of the programme in consultation with Nasscom , " says Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi , director , IIT-Madras . <p> " We are also hoping to rope in more than 500 mentors on a voluntary basis from industry and academia , " adds AK Ray , professor of the Centre for Educational Technology at IIT-Kharagpur . <p> This is the biggest industry-academia partnership to help students and professionals access top-quality course content and meet specific industry demands . " For the first time , students from both rural areas and metros will have access to the same content , channel , tests , experts and certification , " says Cognizant 's Narayanan . <p> People who take the courses will be eligible to write proctored exams for a minimal fee and get certificates . For the computer science courses , IIT will give certification . For the foundation courses , industry will give certificates . It could also be a joint certification with IITs . <p> " Students from the second year onwards in science and engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered multiple times a year , " says Andrew Thangaraj , associate professor of electrical engineering at IIT-Madras . " It will make a difference in their career progress . " <p> Google is providing its Course Builder platform for hosting MOOCs . HackerRank will provide their web portal , where students can practise their programming assignments and get them verified and graded . <p> Till now , IITs have been offering open courseware on the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning ( NPTEL ) . This is a repository of video lectures created by professors of the seven older IITs and IISC-Bangalore available to anyone , anywhere in the world on Youtube etc . However , NPTEL does not give any certification ; neither does it have any interaction or synchronised classes . In the next phase of NPTEL , all these seven IITs and industry have joined hands to offer courses on the web-based MOOCs platform , which will also offer certification . ? " Cognizant has been discussing this idea with academia and industry for the past three years ... Cognizant will make available infrastructure at its training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable students to take tests and get certified , " says Narayanan . <p> Initially , IITs will run three mini modules of a computer science course , including programming , algorithm , and data structures . Each module will have 12 lectures and there will be a total of 36 lectures over 12 weeks . <p> Going forward , the plan is to repeat this model in VLSI ( very large scale integration ) embedded systems and other branches of engineering and general sciences . <p> " Industry is getting involved with inputs on applicability and problem-solving aspects with the aim of making students more industry and job-ready , " says Sandhya Chintala , executive director , sector skills council , Nasscom , who is leading the programme for the industry association . <p> Industry has also shared a brief on the skills needed for 67 entrylevel job roles . IITs will make these available on MOOC platform . " This is the first time that industry has articulated the performance of an individual at an entry-level job role . This clarity will help formal or non-formal training institutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @
