It 's great time for NRIs to invest in real estate , with rupee at all-time low .  RELATED  With the rupee touching all-time lows against the dollar , it appears to be a great time for non-resident Indians ( NRIs ) to remit funds to India for investment . And for most NRIs , the preferred asset class continues to be real estate . But with the India story looking a little bleak , is property a good investment right now ?  The answer is yes , provided you are patient and cautious . " There has been price correction in India to a certain extent and developers are sitting on huge inventory . However , I estimate that the entire correction will take up to 2 years . So NRIs must be particular in their investments and pick and choose after due research , " says Pankaj Kapoor , founder and managing director at Liases Foras Real Estate Rating &amp; Research Pvt Ltd .  So if you are ready to take that challenging road , here are a few tips to price points  " In the last few months , we have witnessed good closures specifically emerging from NRIs in cities where value deals are available - namely cities like Bangalore , Hyderabad , Chennai and Pune . Demand in the mid-income and budget segments is robust across cities where job creation is the key driver . In light of the rupee 's depreciation , we are confident that the IT/ITeS sector will generate further job creation and strengthen the confidence of employees from this sector who are aspiring to buy first or second homes , " says Om Ahuja - CEO - Residential Services , Jones Lang LaSalle India .  Kapoor adds , " In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and the National Capital Region , the secondary market is appearing very attractive . Investors are exiting these markets and in the past 15 days , prices have corrected up to 25% in some of the cities . So this might be a good time to pick up investor 's stock . Apart from these two key regions , properties in cities like Hyderabad and Kochi are undervalued and it . "  According to Ahuja , the segment where good demand is being witnessed is in the price range of Rs 60 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore .  Investment time horizon and returns  Here is where investors need to be patient . " I think the price correction is going to go on for another 2 years , " Kapoor explains , " which means investors should expect their asset value to remain more or less flat over the next two years . "  Ahuja expects potential returns from current levels to be 10-20% annualized returns over 6-8 years in Bangalore , Chennai , Pune , Gurgaon and Navi Mumbai and 20-30% in Hyderabad .  Tips to buy the right property  Buying property in a market like this can be quite challenging . So here are some parameters that you should look at :  Rental yield  Rental yield is nothing but the annual rent divided by the property value . " Often , buyers tend to ignore rental yield and instead focus only on capital appreciation . However , rental yield is a . When you buy a property , make sure that you can get a rental yield of at least 3.5-4% . An yield of less than that means the property is overvalued , " Kapoor explains .  Months of inventory  Months of inventory is specific to a particular project and is the amount of time the developer takes to sell all available units at the current price .  " An efficient market maintains 8-10 months of inventory . A longer time means that units are not selling at current price and a price correction may happen . Today , Mumbai and NCR carry 44 months of inventory on an average while Bangalore carries 12 months . So this is another aspect you can check to see how inventory is moving , " says Kapoor .  Location  " Right now , a lot of investors are exiting the market so NRIs might find many investor held property up for sale . However , a lot of these investor properties may be in uninhabited markets where the investor may have purchased the property thinking that the area would need to be wary of such locations , " Kapoor explains .  Developer track record  " Developers ' track record in terms of delivery and quality must be verified before investing . Ensure that all approvals in place . Attractive advertisements with celebrity endorsements and futuristic promises should not be the only factor for shortlisting the project for investment . NRIs very often get carried away with good sales pitches and so-called ' premium projects ' . NRIs should also be very cautious when it comes to investing with developers who are over leveraged and carry risk of project not getting completed on time , " Ahuja cautions .  Infact , Kapoor suggests that now may not be a good time to opt for launch properties . " Instead , opting for secondary properties might be a good option at this point . Buying secondary properties has its own advantages . Apart from being well priced , there is no execution risk as the property is already completed . Further , there is no service tax so NRIs can save on that as well , " he says buying opportunities in the current market , experts suggest that NRIs tread with caution .
