asean economic community : what are the advantages and challenges of the new regional bloc ?  the asean economic community , after ten years of hiatus , materialised on sunday at the kuala lumpur summit , where the 10-member association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) signed a historic declaration .  myanmar , philippines , singapore , thailand , indonesia , malaysia and vietnam , brunei , cambodia , and laos have come together to form a strong socio-economic community that will further connect its 625 million people as well as individual economies , which generate a combined output of $2.6 trillion .  before the aec comes into full effect by the end of the year , here is a basic breakdown of the main advantages and the challenges the new bloc may face .  advantages :  free trade area can be a reality for asean nations :  " asean countries are highly integrated , even more than the saarc nations , " srikanth kondapalli , professor , centre for east asian studies at the school of international studies of new bloc will further help in simplifying trade , removing tariffs on goods and services to create free movement across borders , and will also help in expanding investments .  " in practice , we have virtually eliminated tariff barriers between us . now we have to assure freer movements and removal of barriers that hinder growth and investment , " malaysia 's prime minister najib razak said while signing the 2015 kuala lumpur declaration on establishment of the asean economic community .  infrastructure development and gdp growth :  one of the biggest advantages of the aec to the member nations will be the development and implementation of infrastructure projects , especially in setting up energy pipelines and fibre-optics across the region , professor kondapalli pointed out .  the member nations ' transport infrastructure is also likely to be connected .  the economic community will also help nearly double asean 's combined gdp from us$2.6 trillion to us$4.7 trillion by 2020 , the malaysian pm said , according to reuters .  by 2030 , the asean bloc may also well become the fourth-largest economy in terrorism has become a reality in the light of recent events , including the paris attacks and the downing of a russian passenger plane , a collective response to security issues will help asean nations thwart such attacks in the region .  while there is no pan-regional terror group threatening security , there have been instances of isolated terrorism in the south east asian countries in the recent past , especially with the abu sayyaf group still working actively in philippines and the recent bombing in bangkok .  " the asean nations have taken measures to address non-traditional security challenges , such as piracy , drug trafficiking and illegal immigration . they have to implement strong measures to combat terrorism as well , " the professor said .  challenges :  south china sea dispute : one of the the most sticky points for the asean countries is the ongoing south china sea dispute .  while malaysia , vietnam and phillipines have contested china 's claims over islands in the region , other asean nations such as singapore and myanmar have taken a different stand , professor the aec , if the dispute becomes extremely heated in the future , it may be a cause of concern for the asean countries , " he added .  economic divide : another stumbling blcok could be the glaring economic divide between the lesser developed vietnam , cambodia , laos and myanmar and the richer singapore , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , thailand and the philippines .  the lopsided growth of infrastructure in these countries could be a challenge in implementing projects , and corruption may also play spoilsport .  no asean identity : singapore 's prime minister lee hsien loong correctly pointed out that one of the constraints was that the nations do not have a collective identity needed to take the aec forward .  " one of the constraints on the governments , and one of the reasons asean finds it difficult to make progress together is because there is not a very strong sense of asean identity . it 's really a singaporean identity , or malaysian or indonesian . so that 's the first priority , " lee was quoted saying by the european union ?  the community of asean nations will be bigger than the european union in terms of population , but it still has a long way to go to catch up to the economic output of the latter .  even intra-regional trade among member countries stands at 24 per cent of asean 's total global trade over the last decade , compared to 60 per cent in the european union , according to the associated press .  borderless travel may also not be a near reality for asean .  " while the eu has the schenghen visa that allows for paper-less travel across borders , asean has not gone that far yet . while it may want to ease travel across nations , it may not be at the same level as the eu 's , " the professor said .
