<p> Gone it seems are the days of the director in Indian cinema , and nothing can be truer than this in the Tamil industry , where a Rajinikanth or a Kamal Hassan or a Surya or an Ajith hold audiences in a mesmeric trance . Ajith 's latest outing in Gautham Vasudev Menon 's last of the cop trilogy , Yennai Arindhaal ( after Kaakha Kaakha and Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu ) , is an unmistakable case in point . <p> The audience in the multiplex where I watched this film went into rapturous applause every time Ajith ( as policeman Satyadev ) slipped into the frame , and not that one time when Menon -- in Hitchcockian style -- appeared . The thunderous claps often made it impossible for me to follow some of the on-screen conversations , and this was in addition to several mutes of expletives -- presumably a compromise for an U. <p> The movie is certainly not for universal viewing , and the blood and gore accompanied by gun duels , knifing and bouts of fierce wrestling seem to mock the censor certificate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Ajith show , an actor who has to vanquish villains with a weapon and woo women with a rose . But Menon 's vigilante officer in khaki -- worshipped by colleagues , feared by enemies and chased by women ( one comes on so strongly that it begins to look painful ) -- is a spent hero . Ajith looks not only old and tired , but positively wooden and disinterested playing Satyadev . <p> While Satyadev follows his murdered father 's advice to stay on the right side of law , his adversary , Victor ( a delightfully nuanced performance by Arun Vijay ) , despite a great chance to reform , sinks into organised crime . He steals organs -- not from cadavers alone , but living humans . He is not happy picking just one kidney from a man and letting him live with the other . Victor and his team take both and kill the victim , but when they set their eyes on software executive Thenmozhi ( an unimpressive Anushka Shetty ) , plotting to take her ( hold your breath ) heart and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , Satyadev steps in . Victor had clearly not bargained for this . <p> Yennai Arindhaal weaves in and out of endless chases , and gun battles between the two men . There are songs , there is the nagging voice-over by Ajit telling us about his dilemmas and then there are two romances -- the first that Satyadev has with dancer Hemanika ( essayed with heart-tugging emotions by Trisha Krishnan ) , and the second with Thenmozhi . <p> If there is little sizzle in the romances , the scenes between Satyadev and Hemanika 's daughter from a failed marriage , Esha ( Baby Anikha ) , are so contrived -- a clear example of inept helming . <p> Arguably , Yennai Arindhal is the most disappointing in the trilogy , with Ajith -- probably pushed and prodded by a huge fan club -- refusing to let go the centre stage . But for all the hype and hoopla , I wish Ajith had perked himself up to do some justice to the policeman he is on screen , albeit one who treats the law as an ass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the countless cop dramas . There is just nothing , nothing novel in it that you could have taken home .
