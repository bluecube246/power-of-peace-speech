Read More  AHMEDABAD : For the Lord Jagannath devotees , the year 2015 marks the year when the deity will change the old ' kalevar ' ( body ) and assume the new one . At Jagannath Puri in Odisha , the event will be a grand affair as all three idols of Jagannath , Balbhadra and Subhadra will be made anew according to the age-old rituals and will be set on the giant chariots -- the ritual known as ' Nabakalebara ' .  While the city 's Jagannath temple at Jamalpur will not see the change of ' kalevar ' , it surely will adhere to the July 16 , two days prior to the 138th Rath Yatra .  Mahendra Jha , trustee of Shree Jagannathji Temple Trust , said that in Pushtimaarg Sampradaya , the ritual of changing idols is observed in the year when there are two months of Ashadha or ' adhik maas ' ( additional month ) in Hindu calendar .  " Such events take place at the period of 12 or 18 years . The city temple had seen such a coincidence lastly in 1996 . As the temple does n't have tradition of changing the idols , we will be performing special prayers and rituals -- some of which will have only the priests participating , " said Jha .  Jha said that Adhik Maas is considered very auspicious and the entire month will see thousands of devotees thronging the temple even as the deities will go to their ' maternal place . ' " It is believed that the deity resides in Gau Lok during this period and thus , we also see people taking care of the cow progeny , " he explained .
