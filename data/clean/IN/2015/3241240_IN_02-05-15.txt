sometimes the chic street food you get in swanky indoor settings may be better than the fare outside .  for 150 years almost , jallaluddin 's family has been cooking kheer at lal quan in shahjahanabad using the exact same recipe . full fat milk is slow-cooked on a charcoal fire for almost eight hours , with rice . the result is a thick , creamy pudding , full of smoky aromas , a rich golden colour . this is kheer whose fame has spread far and wide ; the shop -- bade mian 's , as it is popularly called -- is an urban legend . yet , while all of us may have dined on its reputation , far fewer have actually sampled the kheer . it is , after all , not easy for an average south dilliwalla , and others , to brave chawri bazaar , get past the hustle-bustle , dodge the onslaught of rickshaws , pedestrians walking into you , thelas carrying bulky sacks and more ...  in distant saket , at the other end of the city , scenario drastically different , a new modern indian restaurant is gradually gathering steam . desi roots is quirky , colourful . it puts galauti kebab pate on the menu , to be delicately scooped off with bits of ulte tawe ka parantha-chips . there are sinkable couches , a bar and memorabilia that takes you back to an earlier india . but what is most striking is its dessert special : jalalludin ki kheer . presented in a fashionable jar , this is bade miyan stuff : charcoal flavour , the same thickened sweetness . the restaurant actually buys the kheer everyday from the lal quan shop , plates it differently , and serves up to its young customers .  all over india , traditional street food -- chaat , vada pao , bhel puri , samose , mithai , farsaan , and indeed kheer -- is making a huge new transition . from single-dish stalls and shops that traded both in bold flavours and reputations built over hundreds of years , the snacks and sweets are now getting " caf ? -ised " . bade miyan 's kheer being an extreme example , but it is true that you no longer have to brave the lanes and by-lanes of agra and delhi , mathura and mumbai , kolkata , chennai , ahmedabad and pune to get a bite of your favourite street flavours .  cafes , pubs and chains of restaurants such as monkey bar , soda bottle openerwalla , farzi caf ? and more have put the much-loved street eats in jazzed-up formats for their urban , young and aspirational consumers , so that whether you are in delhi , mumbai , chennai or bangalore has now become irrelevant to the process of accessing and enjoying the intrinsic flavours of the bazaars of different towns .  this month , when soda bottle openerwalla opens up its third outpost in the country -- after its overwhelming success in delhi -- bangalore fooderati will have a chance to dine on some tweaked nostalgia . it 's not just the irani caf ? staples that are on the menu , brun maska and berry pulao notwithstanding . but also quintessential bombay creations : baida roti , tardeo grilled sandwiches , eggs kejriwal and more . you do n't have to catch a flight to sample these .  the flip side is what all street food fans stop to ask : do these replications taste the same ? there is no simple answer . part of the romance of eating the common man 's food is also the common man 's setting . when you have worked hard for a meal -- shopped relentlessly in chandni chowk , braved the mumbai locals and more , a hot or spicy offering , reasonably priced , will seem better than a gourmet meal in a fancy restaurant , where expectations are that much higher .  but there is also a question of nuances . chaat , for instance , as it has evolved all over u.p . ( and then spread to other parts of the country ) , uses the same basic ingredients but cooked with slightly different spices and variations as you traverse from region to region . even in cities as close as delhi and agra , both capitals of the mughal empire ( which is when chaat developed  in shahjahanabad , the " authentic " tikki is stuffed with a mash of chana dal , pan-fried , then sliced into two and served as such with the fresh coriander green chutney and its counterpart , the tangy saunth or tamarind sauce . in agra , conversely , the tikki goes under the name of " bhalla " ; the patty remains un-stuffed and is smashed up and served with a lashing of yoghurt and other sauces . the chaat masala used in both these cities is also quite distinct .  it is such finer nuances that tend to get lost when more homogenised forms of food retail take over . but the poshing up of street food also needs to be looked at from the prism of indian chefs finding a more self confident " desi " vocabulary to express themselves and indian consumers growing more comfortable in their skins to demand familiar flavours with a touch ( or more ) of inventiveness .  as a phenomenon , it is quite akin to sushi or rice buns or indeed burgers and crepes redefining themselves globally . also quirkiness and experimentation to elevate their favourite dishes .  an indian accent experimenting with khandvi-ravioli or puchkas with multiple flavours of water , or farzi caf ? serving up smashed bhel with cold liquid nitrogen or even a gaggan anand in bangkok serving up his famous " yoghurt " ( a sphere that reminds you of yoghurt in a papri-chaat ) are all efforts to appease this sensibility towards **25;0;toolong . whether some of these handiworks work , whether they are better than the " originals " may be debatable . it is perhaps also a question of your own sensibilities as a diner .  it may be easy to dismiss modern restaurants experimenting with chaat and street eats . after all , it is a form of reverse snobbery to point out that exact hole-in-the-wall shop that serves the best titbit . but in the hand of competent chefs , much of this modern retail manages to retain the essence of its origins . at the fashionable pali bhavan in mumbai , i had galauti kebab almost as good as in lucknow . that urban legend tundey as well , in my humble opinion , having grown up in that city and now seen the proliferation of the kebab empire .  similarly , i like the version of the vada pav that monkey bar in delhi serves up with its square laadi pav and ghaati masala , as also sodabottleopenerwalla 's berry pulao , though it may be different from britannia 's . and when i took a bite of the kulle , a now-disappearing chaat from old delhi , at desi roots , it was exactly how my family would do them -- ginger slivers , small distinctive chickpeas in place , inside the fruit cups . there is only one chaatwalla in chandni chowk who still dishes these out . but dare i say , desi roots offers much better .  sometimes , traditional places are not the most " authentic " -- steadily watering down their wares , tweaking flavours in response to perceived changes in palates and demand . besides which , at the end of the day , all street food is a matter of innovation . if restaurants attempt the slideshow  nearly 70 underground fires have been raging beneath the jharia coalfields for a century now , engulfing the thickly populated areas in and around dhanbad district , jharkhand . with 23 large underground mines and nine open cast mines , jharia is india 's largest coal producer . text and photos : sindhuja  slideshow  irish christmas markets are fast-passes to a winter wonderland in cities , villages and towns across ireland , combining amazing shopping opportunities with the chance to sample the finest artisanal food and drink -- all this , while soaking up the festive yuletide atmosphere .  group sites  recent article in magazine  the cultural legacy of 2015 can be summed up in two words : beef and intolerance . but in the midst of it all , the year brought some cheer for free-speech advocates with section 66a of the it act being struck down ?
