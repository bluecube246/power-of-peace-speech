<p> Bids should be submitted before September 4 and will remain valid till September 10 . <p> The shipments should reach by September 15 . <p> Bids should be made for a minimum quantity of 1,000 tonnes . Quantity for import can be increased or decreased depending on the prices received in the tender . <p> MMTC has been asked to float tender after tender till the onion supply improves and prices come down . <p> The government has taken several measures to curb price rise in onions , including hiking the export price sharply to USD 700 per tonne to restrict overseas sale and asking state governments including Maharashtra to take stringent action against hoarders and black marketeers . <p> To keep a lid on prices , the central agency SFAC , along with cooperative NAFED , has been boosting supply in price-sensitive Delhi markets at subsidised rates . Even the Delhi government has started selling onions at cheaper rate at Rs 30 per kg.
