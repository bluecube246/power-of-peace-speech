since government is targeting a manifold increase in foreign tourist arrivals ( ftas ) , the hospitality industry feels that the government should introduce a facility whereby the foreign guests who have paid gst on their hotel and restaurant bills can claim refund of gst at the airport at the time of departing .  hotel &amp; restaurant association of eastern india ( hraei ) president sudesh poddar said : " we are confident that the e-visa initiative of the government of india coupled with gst refund for foreign guests will spur the tourism industry into a high growth trajectory . "  what must be kept in mind is that the hospitality industry will not be able to derive much advantage by taking input credit , as a major expense of any hotel or restaurant is the manpower cost and the cost of fuel . since initially taxes on fuel will not fall under the purview of gst , input tax credit will be much lower than the tax collected . in this backdrop , hraei feels the empowered committee of gst to take into account sector .  though hraei members welcomed the introduction of gst bill as it means a single point uniform taxation for all hotels and restaurants throughout the country as well as reduction of paper work and multiple filing of various tax returns , they are not sure about the gst rate that will be fixed by the government .  " the indicative rate of 16 to 20 per cent which is being speculated is very high for the hospitality industry and will mean a body blow to the industry , as a result of which the hotels and restaurants will badly suffer , " the hraei release stated .
