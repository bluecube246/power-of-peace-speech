Since government is targeting a manifold increase in foreign tourist arrivals ( FTAs ) , the hospitality industry feels that the government should introduce a facility whereby the foreign guests who have paid GST on their hotel and restaurant bills can claim refund of GST at the airport at the time of departing .  Hotel &amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India ( HRAEI ) president Sudesh Poddar said : " We are confident that the e-visa initiative of the government of India coupled with GST refund for foreign guests will spur the tourism industry into a high growth trajectory . "  What must be kept in mind is that the hospitality industry will not be able to derive much advantage by taking input credit , as a major expense of any hotel or restaurant is the manpower cost and the cost of fuel . Since initially taxes on fuel will not fall under the purview of GST , input tax credit will be much lower than the tax collected . In this backdrop , HRAEI feels the empowered committee of GST to take into account sector .  Though HRAEI members welcomed the introduction of GST bill as it means a single point uniform taxation for all hotels and restaurants throughout the country as well as reduction of paper work and multiple filing of various tax returns , they are not sure about the GST rate that will be fixed by the government .  " The indicative rate of 16 to 20 per cent which is being speculated is very high for the hospitality industry and will mean a body blow to the industry , as a result of which the hotels and restaurants will badly suffer , " the HRAEI release stated .
