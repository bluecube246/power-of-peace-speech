Out of the ordinary

I picked up Priya Parmar 's book Vanessa and Her Sister with no great expectations .  The languid opening pages promised a lazy Sunday read . Lazy being an appropriate adjective for a book about the Bloomsbury Group , a set that represented an effete dilettantism that used to once set my teeth on edge but rather amuses me now .  Then , on Page 11 , there was this sentence : " I wanted Thoby 's friends to see her dazzle the way she can when she chooses to rake the conversation into a leafy pile and set it alight . " That 's when I sat up . A line like that could only promise a book out of the ordinary .  And it is . Priya Parmar 's book sizzles like some fiery comet , with language , wit and intelligence . It tackles what is not really an easy subject , for while it is a chronicle of the Bloomsbury set , whose lives excite endless curiosity , it is also a deeply personal and revealing account of Virginia Woolf constellation . But it is her sister and artist Vanessa Bell who is at the centre . The sister who must recede so that insecure Virginia might shine ; who deeply resents Virginia 's insanity and genius , and the way it consumes everything in its way .  The format is unusual -- it pretends to be Vanessa 's personal memoir . And the jottings are interspersed randomly with the postcards the Bloomsberries exchanged ; their boat or train tickets , like a Portsmouth Ferry ticket to Le Havre ; the telegrams they sent out about serious stuff like illnesses or frivolities like ' please bring gruyere i like . stop ' ; or Vanessa 's shopping lists for paints and brushes and canvases .  These are all obviously part of the rich material that Parmar studied to produce such an authentic voice for Vanessa and , indeed , for all of the group members in this meticulously researched book . But putting these tickets and telegrams into the book , like one would stick stuff into a travel journal , is a quirky touch that adds a lot ? ne like no amount of mere description of the era could do . The device also acts as a window into the heads of the Bloomsberries , performing the role of omniscient narrator that a journal could not otherwise do .  The Bloomsbury Group was a precocious bunch of intellectuals who got together in the early 1900s to become what was later recognised as a bridge between England 's Victorian and Modern eras . With members like Virginia Woolf , E.M . Forster , Lytton Strachey , John Maynard Keynes , Roger Fry , and Leonard Woolf , the group was practically a Who 's Who of its times . Bertrand Russell , Aldous Huxley , and T.S . Eliot were sometimes associated with them .  Radical and avant-garde , the eclectic bunch met regularly in the house in Bloomsbury that the four Stephen siblings , Vanessa , Thoby , Virginia and Adrian , had set up after the deaths of their parents . They cocked a snoot at all Victorian mores , whether in literature , criticism and painting , or feminism , pacifism and sexuality . homosexuality , cohabitation or m ? nage-a-trois . Not just this but their preoccupation with themselves and their life choices made them the object of much derision . D.H . Lawrence famously described them as " little swarming selves " . Parmar 's book recognises this self-obsession . Desmond MacCarthy 's fianc ? e asks , much to the group 's utter consternation , " Why would others care what boundaries are broken in this house ? " And an amused Vanessa notes in her diary ' I honestly do not think it had occurred to any of us that what we did was unimportant ' .  Vanessa was the group 's anchor but , most importantly , she was anchor to Virginia , who teetered dangerously on the edge of madness ( now thought to be bipolar disorder ) . Parmar paints Virginia from a sister 's eye , warts and all , and shows her pathological dependence on Vanessa , to the point of deeply resenting her marriage to Clive Bell , whom she proceeds to seduce . Virginia 's lesbianism is also latent -- she asks Vanessa Sackville-West , wife of diplomat Harold Nicolson .  Vanessa struggles to hold on to her self against Virginia 's imperious commandeering of her time , attention and affection . " Her way is acquisitive . She is always interested in more -- more affection , more attention ... more warmth , more secrets . " Vanessa 's anger and resentment seethe below the surface , because Virginia would not survive an open confrontation . But , despite this , there is also love , sympathy and pride in Virginia 's immense talent . One evening , listening to her talk with the assembled men , Vanessa says , " Her voice broke free of its rusted shell and slid like a deep river over rocks . I watched them watch her . She stands with them as an equal ... "  The book picks Virginia bare , but it is also an intimate insider view of the Bloomsbury group at their vulnerable , personal moments , rather than their strident public persona . But , most of all , it is a sister 's account of living with and exactly as the painter Vanessa might have , seeing the world in colours and shapes . " ... we four wrung the last hours of tumbling sunshine from the summer , " says a journal entry . Or this : " No ... It is no longer a single , straight-syllabled word ... Instead it is a tumbledown cottage of a word , furnished in curiosity and thatched in doubt . "  Mainly , though , Parmar imagines the drawing rooms , the dinners , the conversations and journeys of the famous group with an unerring eye for detail and tone that makes them come alive . This book takes historical fiction to a delightful new height .  This is the first of three short stories by Seetha Ravi on the musical trinity -- Syama Sastri , Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar . The stories have been translated by Prabha Sridevan , former judge , M ... ?
