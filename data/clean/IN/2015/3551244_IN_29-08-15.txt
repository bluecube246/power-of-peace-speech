Giving shape to its ambitious project , Open Source Intelligent Solution ( Osint ) , the department is set to acquire technology for tracking social networks and internet chat rooms .  A tender inviting global firms for a pre-bid meeting will be out next week , sources said , adding that the cyber cell has finalized the request for procedures related to the proposal .  The project was conceptualized two years ago and TOI was the first to report about Delhi Police 's plan to track online communications on June 22 , 2013 .  " Criminals and terrorists are increasingly resorting to the use and planning purposes . Osint will help us extract and analyze material available on the numerous public domains on the internet , " a senior officer said .  Osint will focus on gathering ' actionable intelligence ' and will also perform ' sentiment analysis ' , the psychological analysis of communications to pre-empt a crime by collecting and analyzing data from online sources . Psychological analysis of sentiments from conversations can help police prevent many unwanted situations , officers said .  The project is being supervised by senior special commissioner of police Dharmendra Kumar and is critical for its ability to analyze content on social media like Facebook and Twitter . This will provide police with a large amount of data at their fingertips and speed up investigations .  With context and object identification , the system will be able to discover related material online and identify people , places , organizations etc . Also , it will help police profile ' suspects ' and build a database of criminals . The technology is already being used in countries like USA and UK .  Police will be the existing databases for analysis . This will reduce the time needed to solve critical cases requiring a high level of technological expertise .  The system will extract data from any accessible website in formats ranging from plain text to Office documents , PDFs , flat files , images , audio and video files and even files accessible via protocols . It would also support encoding for languages like Arabic and Hebrew that are bidirectional .  The move has raised privacy concerns as some officers see potential for misuse of this technology to compromise a person 's fundamental rights . However , cyber cell officers say arrangements will be made to make sure that the technology is used for lawful purposes like national security .
