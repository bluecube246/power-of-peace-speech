<h> Built of red and buff sandstone , Qutub Minar has five storeys and four balconies . ( Photo : Saumya Khandelwal/HT ) <p> Author Rana Safvi leads a walk through Mehrauli , where Prithviraj Chauhan 's army fought Mohammad Ghori 's men , and where Timur pledged not to sack the city of Delhi . <p> Safvi is one of those few Twitter celebrities - she has about 20.6k followers - who is n't given to relentlessly pummelling the ether with tweets full of sound and fury signifying nothing . Her Twitter feed offers Urdu poetry , ruminations on Delhi 's culture and heritage , occasional panegyrics to Krishna , great pictures of historic landmarks , and a glimpse into her own erudite , graceful personality . So when I learn that she has written a book on Mehrauli , the oldest of Delhi 's seven cities , I waste no time in fixing to wander with her through the precinct . <p> We meet at Qutub Minar 's gate and make our way into Mehrauli and past Emperor Akbar 's foster brother Adham Khan 's tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adham Khan was thrown off the ramparts of Agra fort for killing another of the ruler 's foster brothers . The monument is currently being restored and already the intricate tiled pattern in the central dome seems to be emerging from under centuries of grime . <p> Rana Safvi at Adham Khan 's tomb . ( Photo : Saumya Khandelwal/HT ) <p> Trudging down lanes that wind past homes and shops , we arrive at the Shahi Eidgaah where the Delhi sultans once offered their Eid prayers and where Timur pledged not to sack the city . " He called all the ulema and the nobles and promised that he would not destroy or kill people . Then , his women went to see the famous Imarat e Hazar Sutun in Adilabad , where someone misbehaved with them . Some locals also fought with his soldiers . So then Timur revoked his promise , sacked Delhi and killed thousands of people , " Rana says . The silence that follows the story is rent only by the screeching of parrots . <p> Wandering further into Sanjay Van - where once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aashiq Allah or Nazariya Peer . " A lot of people come here , especially with babies , to ward off the evil eye , " Rana says . The complex includes a cave where Baba Farid Ganj-Shakkar is believed to have meditated without food or water for a long stretch . Close to the dargah , which has a fair number of visitors even on a muggy afternoon , are a number of graves . " That 's Ganj e Shaheeda'n , which means ' the place where the martyrs are buried ' , " Rana says explaining that the martyrs here were Mohammad Ghori 's soldiers , who fell in the battles against Prithviraj Chauhan in 1191-92 . Watching a family of mongooses scramble away from the graves and into the forest , I think about the ephemeral quality of human existence , of vital young men sinking into graves from one century to the next , hacking at each other till the end of Time . Rana draws both of us away from sombre thoughts and to the well close by where Baba Farid " did his chillah-e-makoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 nights . <p> Soon we are trudging down winding paths through the jungle and past the remains of a fort wall . " This is where the original city was ; where Anangpal Tomar , Prithviraj Chauhan 's grandfather , established Lal Kot , " says Rana adding that the later Sultans called it Qila Rai Pithaura . The Qila was eventually abandoned by Alauddin Khilji for Siri Fort . " It 's called Siri fort because of the 8,000 Mongol heads he had buried in the foundations . That 's the legend , " Rana says as we return to the busier part of Mehrauli past overflowing garbage heaps and remnants of more ruins , a testament to how badly we treat our magnificent historical sites that would otherwise rival the monuments of Rome . But whatever the state of our built heritage , you must pick up a copy of Rana Safvi 's book . Full of information about Mehrauli 's monuments and interspersed with legends and poetry , Where Stones Speak is the handbook you should cart along on any exploratory walk through an area where ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Qutub Minar ( Photo : Saumya Khandelwal/HT ) <p> At 72.5m with 379 steps and built of red and buff sandstone , the Qutub Minar has five storeys and four balconies . Built by three sultans and repaired by many , the history of its construction is all given in the inscriptions on the various levels of the minar . It is the tallest ashlar masonry minar in the world <p> 2 . Adham Khan 's tomb ( Photo : Saumya Khandelwal/HT ) <p> The son of Maham Anga , Emperor Akbar 's foster mother , Adham Khan murdered another of the ruler 's foster brothers , Atgha Khan , in a fit of rage . For this , he was twice thrown off the ramparts of Agra Fort . His mother died of grief six months later . Akbar built this monument to Adham Khan . Maham Anga is also believed to be buried in the complex though her tomb is no longer visible . <p> 3 . Shahi Eidgaah ( Photo : Saumya Khandelwal/HT ) <p> The date of the Eidgaah 's construction is not known but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1398 AD . Now made of whitewashed brick , it has a small doorway in the centre of the west wall . This was used by the sultans so they did n't have to cross the common courtyard .
