TNN Jun 2 , 2015 , 09.01 PM IST  PANAJI : Agro-tourism , agriculture education in schools and adoption of villages for all-round development will be the way to go as per the new plan laid out by the agriculture department .  Two agro-tourism spots on the government farms of Codar in Ponda and Kalay in Sanguem have been identified for the development of camping sites with overviews of agriculture in Goa .  Local schools will also be encouraged to utilize the service for schools and centres of excellence will be established in these locations . While floriculture will be adopted at the Kalay farm , the Codar farm will have olericulture .  Speaking to mediapersons on Monday , agriculture minister Ramesh Tawadkar said " Agro-tourism can also be used as a model that each farmer can adopt on their own land and make attempts to encourage youngsters to take up careers in farming . An area between 0.5 to 1 acre will be reserved on all government farms for the same .  This year , the department has selected 33 new villages as part of its adoption of villages for its all-round development programme .

Any farmer in Goa in need of monetary help can therefore apply to us . "  The government will additionally provide an assistance of 80,000 per hectare in the form of input seed , fertilizer , manure , pesticide , water pump , pipelines , sprinklers , drip etc to farmers . The minimum area required for the same is 500 sqm and maximum is five hectares .
