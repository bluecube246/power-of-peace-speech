new delhi : iaf 's su-30 fighter plane pilots are focusing on beyond visual range combat and night flying capabilities even as they gear up for the installation of the ' game changer ' brahmos missiles , with a strike range of nearly 300 kms , in the aircraft .  they are also looking forward to the plane 's next generation ' super 30 ' version which will have advanced avionics .  explaining the concept of the beyond visual range ( bvr ) fights , senior iaf officials at a forward base close to the border with pakistan explained that future wars are unlikely to have close combat fights like in wars in 1965 or 1971 .  " nowadays , the fighter jets are very modernised with state-of-the-art radar systems . what matters now is bvr which means that one can engage with the enemy in air without actually seeing him . once the enemy is locked in , a bvr missile is fired , " wing commander sharad sharma , who has clocked more than 1000 hours on the sukhoi , said . range of about 50-70 kms . but what will truly turn the tide is the integration of the supersonic missile brahmos with the sukhoi .  fighter pilots at the base , one of the newest of the sukhoi , say that the brahmos will be game changer .  " imagine , one can fire a missile nearly 300 kms away from the target . installations across the border can be targeted by our fighter jets without even crossing the border , " a senior pilot explained .  the first test , a dead weight one , of the brahmos integrated sukhoi is likely to take place early next month or even this month-end .  the second test will be by firing a dummy missile while the third and fourth stages of testing will be with actual missile , but without the 200 kg warhead to validate the guidance system and accuracy . two sukhois will be used for the tests which will be completed in the next one year .  the fourth generation sukhois were inducted into the indian air force in 2002 and is the , hal ( the production agency ) and the sukhoi design bureau in russia are working together on ' super 30 ' project .  " the super 30 project will make the aircraft a 4.5 generation one . while there wo n't be modification to the air frame , the planes will be equipped with next generation radar system , software , integrated touch display and a helmet- mounted display , " iaf officials said .  the sukhois , which have a range of 3,000 kms without mid-air refueling and over 8000 kms with two refuelings , have a capacity to carry up to 12 missiles , including a combination of air-to-air and air-to-surface . the fighter plane can carry up to 32 bombs also .  the sukhoi fighter aircraft pilots are carrying out intensive training for night operations .  " in 1962 and 1971 wars , our fighters did not have night flying capability . we feel that future wars may be fought in the skies during night time and hence a lot of focus is being given to night flying . flying at night if , " they said .  brahmos : drdo 's supersonic cruise missile  brahmos : drdo 's supersonic cruise missile  the army recently test-fired an advanced version of the 290-km range brahmos supersonic cruise missile which penetrated and destroyed a " hardened target " in the pokhran firing range in rajasthan .  jointly developed by india and russia , brahmos is a precision strike weapon for army , navy &amp; air force . we take a look at this supersonic missile and its capabilities :  image : drdo/brahmos  290-km range brahmos  25 nov , 2013  the 290-km brahmos flies at a speed of 2.8 mach and carries a conventional warhead of up to 300 kg . the missile can be launched from multiple platforms including land , sea , sub-sea and air .  both the army and navy have already inducted the missile in service , while the air-version of the weapon is scheduled to be flight tested by the iaf soon .  image : drdo/brahmos  can be launched from multiple platforms  25 nov , 2013  according to the mobile launchers , submarines and aircraft against land and sea targets . the missile has a maximum velocity of 2.8 mach and cruises at altitudes varying from 10 metres to 15 km .  image : drdo/brahmos  further enhancements underway  25 nov , 2013  the missile has a maximum velocity of 2.8 mach and cruises at altitudes varying from 10 metres to 15 km .  image : drdo/brahmos  brahmos ship-based system :  25 nov , 2013  brahmos supersonic cruise missile is capable of hitting sea based targets beyond radar horizons . " it can be launched in either inclined or vertical configuration based on the type of the ship , " claims drdo.
