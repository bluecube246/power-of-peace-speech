odisha let saurashtra off the hook  pacers reduce visitors to 99 for eight but fail to capitalize as saurashtra make 218 in their first innings  tnn feb 7 , 2015 , 06.30 am ist  basant mohanty after his four-wicket haul against saurashtra on friday  cuttack : it 's never too late to lose the plot . at least that is what odisha proved on the first day of their last group-stage ranji trophy match at barabati stadium here on friday . with saurashtra tottering on 99 for eight a little after lunch , the hosts let their hopes for the seven points on offer fade when they allowed no. 7 batsman chirag jani to team up with the tail-enders to take the visitors to 218 in their first essay and change the script of the day . at stumps , odisha were zero for no loss managing to get just one over of batting on day 1 and with openers paresh patel and girija rout at the crease .  while the odisha bowlers , led by basant mohanty ( 4-40 ) , ) , reigned supreme in the first part of proceedings , the latter half saw the emergence of the hero of the day in 25-year-old jani . the all-rounder took his team out of the doldrums and to a fighting total but could not get the coveted three-figure for himself as he was left stranded and unbeaten at the other end on 99 . he also got the assistance from tail-enders siddharth trivedi and sudeep tyagi with whom he formed ninth and tenth-wicket partnerships of 47 and 72 runs respectively .  before that , it had been a one-sided story with odisha in the driver 's seat . skipper abhilash mallick won the toss and asked the visitors to bat .  saurashtra lost their first wicket in the form of opener sagar jogiyani who was caught at slip to a mohanty out-swinger in the fifth over . but the highlight among the dismissals was that of cheteshwar pujara who was completely deceived and got his off-stump uprooted by the second delivery of mohanty 's second spell , which was a gem of an in-swinger .  then the saurashtra behera and mangaraj playing their parts in the action .  in fact , it never looked that the visitors could get back in the game until jani held the fort and reached his fifty . then he let his bat do the talking . the five sixes that he hit , which were also the only five of the saurashtra innings , also came after the ninth man was dismissed and his free-flowing shots changed the texture of this vital group b encounter .  related  from around the web  more from the times of india  recommended by colombia  from around the web  more from the times of india  recommended by colombia  comments  characters remaining : 3000  or proceed without registration  share on twitter  sign in with  facebookgoogleemail  refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community . help us delete comments that do not follow these guidelines by marking them offensive . let 's work together to @ @ @ @ @
